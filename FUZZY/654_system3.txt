pan masala ? 
The state?
s move has angered public health experts fighting against the  sale of products that have cancer causing agents. ?
Areca nut is a known carcinogen. 
It is present in pan masala, the sale of which was banned, but now the government is reconsidering it, which is shocking,? 
said professor Pankaj Chaturvedi, Tata Memorial Hospital who treats head and neck cancers.?
The World Health Organisation and several studies in India have proven beyond doubt that pan masala causes serious health hazards including mouth and throat cancer. 
Our state is bound to become a laughing stock if the ban isn?
t continued,? 
There were several appeals made to the CM (chief minister), regarding the ban on areca nut,? 
he added. 
Dr Kailash Sharma, director (Academics) Tata Memorial Hospital said in a letter to the state, ?
We sincerely urge you to continue the ban on flavoured chewing tobacco and flavoured supari (Pan Masal) permanently to save our future generations. 
Currently, the ban is applicable for only one year and it has to be renewed annually.
