They will line up alongside other expensive arrivals including the centre-back John Stones, signed last season for ?47m, and the ?34.9m goalkeeper Ederson from Benfica.The signing of Mendy, in particular, is a statement not only of City?
He switched to Monaco last summer for ?11m where he established himself as one of the best full-backs in the world with his powerful and direct style of play as the club claimed the French title and reached the Champions League semi-finals.Like Walker, Mendy is at his most effective going forward and City will hope the duo can add a surge of energy in wide areas that was lacking last season; Guardiola received some criticism for switching between four and three at the back and deploying his full-backs in unfamiliar roles tucked into midfield. 
He is undoubtedly one of the world?
