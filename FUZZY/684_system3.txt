New Delhi, Jul 23 (PTI) At least 26 chartered accountants have come under the scanner of the ICAI for allegedly helping shell companies, a senior official said. 
The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) is the regulator for accountancy professionals and can initiate disciplinary action against erring members. 
As the government continues its clamp down on shell companies in efforts to deal with the black money menace, many entities have come under the lens of various agencies, including the Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO). 
The ICAI can initiate stringent disciplinary proceedings against members violating norms. 
The measures can include suspension and even cancelling their registrations. 
Shell companies are dubious entities that are generally used for laundering illegal funds. 
However, the term shell company is not defined under the companies law. 
Till July 12, the corporate affairs ministry has deregistered more than 1.62 lakh companies that have not been carrying out business activities for long.
