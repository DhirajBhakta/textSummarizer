Hundreds of angry students blamed the evaluation system put in place this year where they alleged that incompetent examiners evaluated the answer sheets. 
What has now been highlighted is the rot prevailing in the Bihar Board. 
India Today is in possession of the mark sheets of many students who had applied for scrutiny of their papers at the BSS college in Begusarai which was the one of the examination centre. 
There are not one but more than dozen of candidates whose marks have shots up unexpectedly after re-evaluation.
?More mix-up was found in subjects like Maths, Science, Hindi and Sanskrit after scrutiny. 
I demand a detailed investigation into this mess in the Bihar Board.
