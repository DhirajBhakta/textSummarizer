New Delhi, Aug 1 (PTI) Finance Minister Arun Jaitley today said a "proper decision" would be taken on Air Indias future in a competitive market and that it would be in the governments interest to protect jobs at the airline. 
His remarks come at a time when a group of ministers headed by him is working on the modalities for the divestment of loss-making Air India. 
He also wondered for how long can tax collected from the public be given to the public sector airline. 
The previous UPA government had extended bailout package worth little over Rs 30,000 crore to the national carrier for a 10-year period starting from 2012.
