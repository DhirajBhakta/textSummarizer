West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee today reacted sharply to Bollywood actor Kajol's controversy where the actor reportedly clarified what meat she had eaten recently.Speaking at a public rally in North Dinajpur district, Mamata said the actor had come up with the clarification out of fear. 
The Trinamool Congress supremo's comment comes after the actor tweeted a clarification that a video that she had earlier shared on social media was not of beef but "legal" buffalo meat."
I'm issuing this clarification because this is a sensitive matter that may hurt religious sentiments, which is not my intention," Kajol has tweeted on Monday soon after her video went viral a day before.KAJOL CLARIFIED IT WAS NOT BEEF Though the actor has removed the video from her Facebook page, it has already gone viral. 
However, soon after the post, social media went abuzz with many questioning her given husband and actor Ajay Devgn had campaigned for the BJP, which seeks beef ban across the country.The Bengal chief minister's outcry on the matter is not new.
