Shrivastava appealed the decision with the film certification tribunal, which said the film could be released with an adult certification and after minor cuts. 
Relating the story of four women who want to realise their dreams, the movie has sparked a debate in India over what is permissible in movies and how women are actually portrayed. ?
Our popular culture justifies this perspective, and makes stalking seem like love, makes harassment and abuse of women okay.?
Campaigners in India have urged the film industry to stop glorifying stalking and harassment after several violent deaths of women.
