The Karnataka Assembly came under fire over a video in which the state's Forest Minister Ramanath Rai is seen ordering the Dakshina Kannada Superintendent of Police (SP) Bhushan Gulabrao Borase to arrest Kalladka Prabhakar Bhat of the RSS. 
Rai claimed that members of the sangh parivar were allegedly involved in the murder of a gram panchayat member and his move was to ask the police to arrest the man in question."
Referring to the communal violence in Kalladka, the opposition feared that such allegations could further fuel the situation.As the issue rocked the Assembly, the speaker intervened and assured that the state home minister will take stock of the situation.However, the Vishwa Hindi Parishad and the Bajrang Dal took out protests demanding the resignation of Rai.
