By Juhi Chakraborty New Delhi, Jul 24 (PTI) Aadar Jains entry in Bollywood comes at a time when the nepotism debate has gained momentum but the newcomer says he would like people to not judge him before seeing his work. 
Aadar, the grandson of Raj Kapoor, will make his debut with "Qaidi Band" and his launch event was hosted by his cousin Ranbir Kapoor. 
The youngster says someone belonging to a film family does get an easy opportunity to meet a director or a casting director but it does not guarantee a movie as an actor can only go forward on the basis of merit. 
The movie is a far-cry from the usual glamorous debut which newcomers often opt for but Aadar says he didnt think of it like that when he signed the project. 
On his role as a prison inmate, Aadar says he had no real understanding of how to go about the role as his only references have been movies and TV shows like "Shawshank Redemption" and "Prison Break".
