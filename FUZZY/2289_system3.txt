t believe in analytics, I believe in living my life. 
If I start spending time  analysing my choices, I will not be able to live my life. 
For me, a simplistic way of looking at life was that if my phone still rings and the other person says that ?
I am successful,? 
The minute I am off camera, I am done. 
After I would finish shooting for a film, it would be a little difficult to shake the character off  but now after my shoot I believe that you have to shake it off otherwise it starts becoming a part of you,?
