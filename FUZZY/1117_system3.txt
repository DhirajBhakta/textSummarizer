New Delhi, Feb 17 (PTI) The statement of Nathuram Godse, along with other relevant records related to the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi, should be "proactively disclosed" on the website of the National Archives, the CIC has ruled. 
Information Commissioner Sridhar Acharyulu said, "One may disagree with Nathuram Godse and his co-accused but we cannot refuse disclosure or circulation of his opinion. 
"At the same time, neither Nathuram Godse nor the holder of his theme or opinion can go to the extent of killing a person whose philosophy he cannot agree with," he said in his order. 
Although neither Delhi Police nor the National Archives cited any objection on the disclosure of the information, Acharyulu said that the information sought does not attract any of the exemption clauses.
