Statistics boils down to nine such marriages a day.Known as Pakadwa Vivah (marriage by abduction), the tradition is simple: zero-in on a prospective groom, kidnap him and make him tie the nuptial knot at gunpoint.

Today Rajiv is employed as a meter reader with Bihar Electricity Board while Madhuri is school teacher at Nawada.Rajiv's younger brother Ashok (40 year), a lawyer, was married at the age of 13 in a similar fashion with Annu of Pakribaswan village.
