The intel input was about three ISIS terrorists trying to gain access to the city via sea route. 
The Coast Guard had been long tracking developments in the case. 
A senior Mumbai Police official said, "The information is received from the Coast Guard through fax. 
We are taking all necessary precautions and getting details about the suspects from the information provided to us."
