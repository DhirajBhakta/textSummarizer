BJP REBUKES BHUSHAN The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) wasted no time in chiding Bhushan - whose remark is certain to irk many, many more - and said the lawyer had insulted Lord Krishna.Bhushan should first study India's tradition and mythology and then make such comments, BJP leader Bhupendra Yadav said."
OWAISI'S POTSHOT Bhushan's remark comes a day after MP Asaduddin Owaisi took a pot shot at the BJP's policies on beef in two states - Uttar Pradesh, where a crackdown on illegal slaughterhouses is underway, and Nagaland, where there's no such policy yet.In fact, Visasolie Lhoungu, the Nagaland BJP chief, told the Hindustan Times, "(A) ban on cow slaughter like the one in UP won't take effect in Nagaland if our party comes to power next year.
