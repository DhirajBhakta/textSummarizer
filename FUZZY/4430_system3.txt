Washington, Feb 28 (PTI) Scientists have developed a novel computer method called ZeitZeiger that uses a sample of blood to accurately predict circadian time - the time of day according to a persons body clock. 
"This is the first study to use genome-wide expression data from many individuals to develop a biomarker of the circadian clock in human blood," Hughey said. 
In addition to predicting circadian time, the researchers demonstrated that ZeitZeiger can also be used to show how disruptions to sleep-wake and light-dark cycles affect the circadian clock. 
The rhythms produced by the circadian clock differ widely between individuals at any given time of day and they are often disrupted by modern environments, for example due to shift work or reduced exposure to sunlight.
