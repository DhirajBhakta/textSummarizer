The App Accelerator is initiated with the aim towards delivering specialised support to the Indian developers, including tools and best practices to hone their skills. 
Every week, the Apple experts will provide briefings and one-on-one app reviews for the Indian developers. 
This will be done with the help of Swift, Apple's powerful and intuitive programming language created to build apps for iOS, Apple TV, and Apple Watch. 
"In just the first few weeks, we've already seen some incredible developers here at the App Accelerator Bengaluru, including Practo and Reliance Games, create innovative apps that can meet the needs of customers in India and around the world," says Philip Schiller, senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing.
