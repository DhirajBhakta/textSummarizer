From K J M Varma Beijing, Dec 12 (PTI) Chinas richest man, owning a USD 92 billion empire, today said he is looking for a successor, most likely from a group of professional managers, to take over his business after his son declined to be his heir apparent. 
"I have asked my son about the succession plan, and he said he does not want to live a life like I do," Wang was quoted as saying by Hong Kongs South-China Morning Post at?China Entrepreneurs Summit. 
The wealthy scions of Chinas billionaire entrepreneurs, known as?fuerdai?are increasingly striking different paths, as more than three decades of break-neck economic growth and overseas education have given them different experiences, world view and aspirations from their parents.
