Along with a college friend, Amol Sawant, 30, Shrungar Raul and Pervez Shaikh began teaching football to street children from Matunga, in Mumbai, later starting Anstrengung United, an NGO that today trains as many as 200 street children."
When we were in college, there were four street children who would beg for money outside our campus. 
Over time, we became friends with them. 
None of these children had been to school, and over time we realised they were getting addicted to drugs. 
Living on the streets, there were also the usual street fights and lack of nutrition and hygiene. 
After we finished college and got jobs, we decided to do something for them."
