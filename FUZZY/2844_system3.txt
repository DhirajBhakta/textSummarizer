Delhi Metro's new Magenta Line from Janakpuri West to Botanical Garden would have DMRC's first driverless trains.The Magneta Line, which has already missed two deadlines, would be partially thrown open to public in October. 
These driverless trains, known as UTO (Unattended Train Operations), will be phased in gradually after the start of the line. 
Initially, drivers will be deployed on both the Magenta and Pink Lines. 
The CBTC technology will improve the coordination between the trains coming from different directions in terms of signalling, which will eventually increase the frequency of trains," a DMRC spokesperson told IANS. 
A CHALLENGING PROJECTA project under Phase-3 of DMRC, the Metro termed this stretch as "one of the most challenging corridors". 
Removal of slums from Punjabi Bagh and Mayapuri to acquire land and control heavy traffic were among factors that posed challenge during the construction, the DMRC said. 
The longest in Delhi Metro, the Pink Line is poised to cover almost the entire circular Ring Road. 
It is slated to open for public between December 2017 and March 2018 in stages.
