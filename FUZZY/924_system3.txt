The Kannada film Dandupalya 2 has landed itself in a fresh controversy after a explicit video featuring actress Sanjjanaa Galrani was allegedly leaked online. 
According to reports, the scene was removed from the film following objections by regional censor board. 
The controversial scene also shows the physical torture endured by the actress.Speaking to the media, Sanjjanaa said, "We are figuring out who is behind the leak and will give a complete clarification once director Srinivasa Raju, who is in Hyderabad ahead of its Telugu release, returns to Bengaluru."
Asked whether it is a publicity stunt, she said, "Dandupalya is already doing well. 
So, there is no need for such publicity. 
We shot something and I am seeing something else here."
Dandupalya 2 is a sequel to the 2012 film of the same name. 
The film is based on the infamous gang from Dandupalya.
