After examining the scheme, the ministry gave its approval in March, but the work could not be initiated as the fund was not transferred. ?
This will be a one-stop destination, where a visitor will be able to study the composite culture of the Walled City under one roof, said Goel.?
Literature pertaining to the city and the history of the place since its inception will also be provided, so that people coming to the museum can learn about it. 
Goel contributed funds from his Member of Parliament Local Area Development (MPLAD) fund to restore the building as the Walled City museum.
