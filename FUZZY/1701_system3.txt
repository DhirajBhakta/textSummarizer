Shahid Kapoor may have won hearts with his adorable displays of affection for wife Mira Rajput, but there was also a section of people who were unhappy with him for advocating arranged marriage and constantly bringing up his age difference with Mira. 
However, the actor himself is cool as a cucumber and unperturbed by the criticism. 
It is not everyday that a Hindi film hero goes and marries someone no one even knows of. 
I am an actor. 
Most parts of my life are up for discussion, by default. 
It won't stop whether I like it or not. 
If people cross the line, we do get displeased. 
But the line itself is wide. 
We can't be touchy and say, bhai mere baare mein koi baat nahin karega."
