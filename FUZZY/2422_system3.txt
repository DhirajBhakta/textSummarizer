s tennis player of his generation, but good luck finding the silverware to show for it.Roddick?
s home in Austin, Texas.?
We have his US Open trophy,? 
Decker told People magazine in an interview published on Wednesday. ?
But all his other trophies Andy threw away in the garbage.?
Roddick was 21 when he shot to stardom with his breakthrough win at Flushing Meadows in 2003 ? 
still the last major singles title won by an American man ? 
and finished that season atop the ATP rankings. 
s grand slam champion for the first time in 129 years, since the inception of what then was called the US National Championships.While Roddick never managed to win a second grand slam championship despite reaching four more finals (and losing to Roger Federer in each of them), the outspoken Texan won 32 titles and spent nearly a decade in the top 10 during a 12-year professional career that will see him inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame later this month.?
It was really upsetting,? 
Decker said of Roddick?
s shock decluttering. ?
He did it one day when I was out of town. 
[He] decided that these don?
t mean success to me, these don?
t define me and I don?
t really care to have these material things sitting around the house, so he threw them in the trash. 
I think he saved a few but they are not on display.?
He and Decker, who married in 2009, welcomed their first child, Hank, in September 2015.
