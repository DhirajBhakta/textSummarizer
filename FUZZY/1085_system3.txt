New Delhi, Feb 19 (PTI) FAQs about menstruation will now be answered at Delhi government schools with an NGO conducting "period talks" for teenage girls. 
"Usually lessons on menstruation are imparted to girls by their mothers who unfortunately also pass on superstition, stigma and fear surrounding the natural bodily process. 
"There is an urgent need to educate young girls that menstruation is no disease and they need not be ashamed of it," said Surbhi Singh, a gynaecologist, who has been roped into conduct these lessons. 
During the session, a questionnaire will be handed out to girls to gauge how much they know about the process.
