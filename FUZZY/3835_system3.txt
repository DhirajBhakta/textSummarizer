It might not be a Thursday, but Salman Khan's sister Arpita Khan was in a mood to share a throwback picture with her bhaijaan. 
Arpita took to Instagram to share an adorable picture from her childhood. 
Now a mother, Arpita looks almost unrecognisable in this old picture where she is seen hugging Salman. 
In fact, Sohail Khan also makes an appearance in the frame with his nerdy glasses.?? 
Buzz has it that Arpita was hopeful that Salman will launch her husband Aayush Sharma in Bollywood, but he decided otherwise. 
However, Arpita has shut her detractors with his perfect picture. 
On the work front, Salman is currently busy shooting for Ali Abbas Zafar's Tiger Zinda Hai.
