New Delhi, Apr 27 (PTI) Telecom regulator TRAI plans to start by May this year industry-wide consultation on framing rules for new mobile operators testing their services prior to full-fledged commercial launch. 
The issue of specific framework for trial services had cropped-up last year after newcomer Reliance Jios stormy entry into the telecom sector. 
The upcoming consultation paper is expected to address issues like the number of subscribers that can be on-boarded during the trial period by a new operator, as also the duration for such network and service testing.
