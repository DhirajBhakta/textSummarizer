Rakhi regularly uploads  a number of hilarious videos and posts. 
Users were  shocked to find out  that her page suddenly got deleted on Monday morning.  
It turns out that she isn?
t the one who has deleted her account. 
Mera Instagram account hack ho gaya hai. 
(My account has been hacked. 
I am very upset.  
One of my haters have done this. 
This was a way I used to connect to my fans and so many stars including Salman Khan and Sohail Khan have told me that whenever they are depressed, they watch my videos for entertainment,? 
she says. 
The 38-year-old doesn?
t plan to come back on Instagram any time soon because she feels that people have been humiliating her a lot on social media. ?
They think I am a slut. 
They have even bad mouthed my mom so many times. 
These things do affect me,? 
adds Rakhi.
