Google has started rolling out the Android Nougat 7.1.2 update to all Pixel and Pixel XL users across the globe. 
The Android Nougat 7.1.2 update brings with a number of bug fixes and improvements targeted at the two Pixel smartphones in particular. 
If you have a Pixel smartphone, there is a chance you might not experience this issue at all after updating. 
It seems some Pixel and Nexus owners will have to make do with traditional means of unlocking the smartphone till a fix is issued.The latest iteration of Android Nougat is now also rolling out to Nexus 6P users enrolled in Google's Android Beta program.
