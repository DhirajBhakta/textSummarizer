Almost a week after the rollout of the landmark Goods and Services Tax (GST), the Congress today called it "imperfect" and a "mockery" of the original draft, and added that it should have been delayed by at least two months since it fails to achieve its purpose in its current form."
The GST Network should have undergone a dry run before implementation," former Finance Minister P Chidambaram said in a press conference in New Delhi."
This GST fails to achieve that," he said.The senior Congress leader demanded that real estate, electricity and petroleum products must be brought under GST. 
Citing the example of the crisis in the Tamil Nadu film industry, Chidambaram said there are seven rates in the current GST.
