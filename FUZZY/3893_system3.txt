Priyadarshan, the chairperson of the feature film section for the National Film Awards, said he does not understand why people are questioning Akshay Kumar's Best Actor award. 
But the director says last year Ramesh Sippy was head of the jury and none questioned his good friend Amitabh Bachchan's Best Actor win, so why should he and Akshay be subjected to such allegations. 
But the award recognises his performance in both the movies,"said Priyadarshan.This year saw the dominance of regional cinema at the National Film Awards with Marathi film Kasaav winning best feature film, Surabhi CM getting best actress and Rajesh Mapuskar being named best director for Marathi movie Ventilator. 
Regional movies are doing a very good job of storytelling through social issues," he said.|| Read more ||Priyadarshan's reason why Akshay won National Award over Aamir is bizarreAkshay Kumar and Sonam Kapoor on National Award win: Who would have thought!!
