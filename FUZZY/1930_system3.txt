Chelsea have agreed terms with Shanghai SIPG for the permanent transfer of Oscar. 
The 25-year-old midfielder will join the Chinese Super League side at the beginning of the January transfer window after four and a half years at Stamford Bridge.During that time the Brazil international has won the Premier League, Europa League and League Cup but, more recently, he has found his chances limited under Antonio Conte.The deal is understood to be around ?52m, with Oscar reportedly earning ?400,000 a week. 
A statement on the Chelsea website said: ?
We thank Oscar for his wonderful service and wish him the very best of luck.?
Oscar will join the former Chelsea manager Andr? Villas-Boas at Shanghai SIPG and is the latest player to move to China.The former Chelsea striker Demba Ba is at Shanghai Shenhua while Graziano Pell? swapped Southampton for Shandong Luneng in July for a reported ?13m.Ramires, Gervinho, Hulk and Ezequiel Lavezzi have also been tempted to head to south-east Asia and more could follow in January.Conte has recently spoken of the ?
danger? 
posed by Chinese Super League sides, who now have the financial power to outbid Premier League clubs.Speaking last week he said: ?
The Chinese market is a danger for all teams in the world; not only for Chelsea but all teams in the world. 
But I think we must be concentrated on our work. 
I think this league is fantastic and to play in this league is a great opportunity, a great honour.?
You must be very proud to play in this league. 
I think it?
s the best league in the world. 
For this reason, I don?
t worry about this.?
