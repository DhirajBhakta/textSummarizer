A team of researchers at an Israeli university has successfully tested a technology using fluorescent bacteria and lasers that could become a safer system for detecting buried landmines.An estimated 100m landmines are scattered in some 70 countries, a legacy of often long-past conflict, and the devices injure up to 20,000 people a year. 
Mine clearance work is typically dangerous, labour-intensive and costly.The team at Jerusalem?
s Hebrew University has tested mine detection using bacteria genetically modified to give off a fluorescent signal when mines ? 
often made out plastic ? 
Encased in polymer beads scattered on the suspected minefield, that fluorescence is then detected by a laser system that researchers suggest could be mounted on a vehicle ? 
including drones.The system has been successfully tested in a field of real landmines, scanning the ground at a rate of around 18cm per second ? 
a speed the researchers hope to increase.Belkin?
s team is not the first to develop bacteria that glow in the presence of explosive vapour ? 
but it appears to be the first to have developed a potentially functioning detection system using the technology.?
Our field data show that engineered biosensors may be useful in a landmine detection system,? 
said Prof Shimshon Belkin, who headed the experiment. 
However, the technology would need to be developed further still, he added.?
The university said in a statement: ?
This appears to be the first demonstration of a functional standoff landmine detection system.?
