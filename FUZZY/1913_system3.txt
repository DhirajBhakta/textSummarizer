Ahead of the budget, Prime Minister Narendra Modi today favoured increasing the tax contribution from various market participants in a "fair, efficient and transparent way" and promised more "sound and prudent policies and reform measures". 
Asking the regulators and taxmen to think about the contribution of market participants to the exchequer, Modi said, "The low contribution of taxes may be due to the structure of our tax laws. 
When introduced, the rate was 0.125 per cent for a delivery stock and 0.025 per cent on intra-day transactions and 0.017 per cent on futures and options transactions, to stop tax avoidance of capital gains tax. 8. 
The 2013 budget reduced STT to 0.1 per cent on the turnover for delivery and also futures, while for equity options, it was cut to 0.05 per cent on sale premium. 9. 
Currently, the STT is charged at 0.1 per cent on all delivery trades in the cash market, and at 0.025 per cent on sell leg of all non-delivery trades in the cash market (equity shares and units of equity oriented funds).
