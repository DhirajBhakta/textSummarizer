Recovering from a shoulder injury, India skipper Virat Kohli missed the start of day two proceedings on the field as his deputy Ajinkya Rahane led the team against Australia in the third Test in Ranchi. 
Jadeja is going through the best phase of his career"India's Ravindra Jadeja made two important points with his seventh five-wicket Test haul on Friday - that he is not in the team just to play second fiddle to spin colleague Ravichandran Ashwin and that he does not need dustbowls to succeed.If India are still in the third Test against Australia, it is due largely to the indefatiguable left-arm spinner who came up with a lion-hearted effort to restrict the tourists. 
(India vs Australia, 3rd Test, Day 2: As it happened)Jadeja bowled more than one third of his team's total overs, claimed 5/124 and effected a spectacular run-out with his back to the stumps to wrap up the Australia innings.The 28-year-old became the leading wicket-taker in the four-Test series, overtaking off-spinner Ashwin, who has taken only one in the match. 
(Virat Kohli joins team in warm-up, but does not field on Day 2)Jadeja is level on points with Ashwin at the top of the ICC rankings for Test bowlers and the bearded all-rounder with tousled hair proved why."
