Naam Shabana, starring Taapsee Pannu in the lead role, is a spin-off of the 2015 hit Baby. 
The problem is that the trailer gave it all away, which, by default, makes the first half of Naam Shabana a drag.Shabana (Taapsee) is a reserved second year B.Com student whose life revolves around Kudo training and her widowed mother. 
(Note that the baddie has already eliminated five seasoned agents who went to apprehend him.)It is perhaps to the director Shivam Nair's credit that in spite of the loopholes, Naam Shabana gives us some enjoyable moments. 
Shabana is told that her Muslim identity is an advantage to the agency because, "Aaj kal ke jo haalat hai, us mein tumhare religion ki vajah se humara access badhta hai aur raaste khulte hai."
