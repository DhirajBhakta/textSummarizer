Samsung has announced two of its Chrome OS based laptops -- Chromebook Plus and Chromebook Pro at the Consumer Electronics Show that come with a touch screen display and support for Android apps. 
But Samsung bundles a stylus with its Chromebooks, same as what you get with a Galaxy Note 5 (or you would have got with your Note 7) that allows you to write and draw using pre-loaded applications -- Google Keep and Samsung ArtCanvas. 
Google added stylus support to Chrome OS in mid-2016 and uses software to predict where the user will position the pen next to improve its responsiveness.? Both the Chromebooks are fitted with mobile grade chipsets with 4GB RAM and 32GB e.MMC storage.
