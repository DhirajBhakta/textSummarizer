The bears have been reintroduced to the mountain region over the past three decades after being wiped out by hunters.The sheep, which belonged to a farmer in Couflens, south-west France, are thought to have taken fright when the bear appeared in the area last Sunday.After the predator attacked one of the sheep, 209 others in the flock panicked and hurled themselves off a 200 metre-high cliff on the border between France and Spain. 
There are now thought to be about 30 brown bears in the region.More than 130 sheep died in a similar, bear-related incident in the French Pyrenees last year.Farmers on both sides of the border blame the bears for attacks on their livestock and the predators are sometimes killed.
