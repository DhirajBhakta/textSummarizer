The Noida authority has decided to names all lanes in villages for easy identification of different pockets in each village. 
These urban villages are located adjacent to upscale residential sectors but are yet to have basic civic amenities such as drainage, sewage network and roads, among others.?
We are working on preparing a robust municipal policy to ensure the development of civic facilities in villages on a par with urban areas. 
Poor civic amenities in villages affect urban areas as well, officials said. 
It has to be stopped immediately if Noida officials want to address civic issues in villages,? 
Villagers have been demanding a unique address (land title) for many years as it will give their properties a legal status and enable them to get loans, on a par with flat or plot owners. ?
