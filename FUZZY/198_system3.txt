When you are growing up, you have a notion of what a superstar will be like. 
Akshay sir is absolutely different from that. 
When you see Akshay sir, it all comes crashing down. 
He is so down-to-earth and is always punctual on set. 
Professionally, I wish I could adopt those habits from him.?     
The best love stories have known the greatest pain. 
Here's #LatthMaar for you ? 
t even aware that Akshay was part of the film, when she signed it. ?
I said yes to the film because of the script. 
I didn?
t know about Akshay sir being a part of it then. 
It is one of those rare films that is an out-and-out romance. 
It?
s a very credible film with a social message, so I knew I am not letting it go,? 
says a proud Bhumi. 
Asked if she thinks that the film will actually turn the spotlight on to the problem of open defecation, she adds. ?
It will be an eye-opener. 
As responsible citizens we must all work towards making a better society. 
We can?
t have the ostrich mentality and look away from issues and think things are fine. 
We all need to work towards it,? 
she says.
