Though she was eased out of the prison department subsequently, she continues to stick to her stand.Sasikala is lodged at Parappana Agrahara central prison in Bengaluru ever since her conviction in February in the disproportionate assets case along with her two relatives VN Sudhakaran and Elavarasi, all serving a 4-year jail term.Extensively quoting the Karnataka Prison Manual, the AIADMK mouthpiece explained rules that permitted amenities for those sentenced to simple imprisonment and in respect of women prisoners.Convicts undergoing simple imprisonment are allowed to wear their own clothes and use their own mattress.With the permission of jail superintendent, the class-1 prisoners could also cook food for themselves inside the jail out of their money and may get help from other prisoners in this regard as well, the daily said. 
They are entitled to a table, a chair and a mirror.Similarly, they could buy fruits, biscuits from their own funds and get them from their friends and relatives too.Such prisoners could also get help from other prisoners in cleaning the cooking utensils with the permission of the jail superintendent, it said.They could also read books, magazines and newspapers from the prison library and may even buy them from outside if a particular magazine or book is not available in jail.Though she was entitled to such amenities, Sasikala did not even fully utilise them, the ruling party?
