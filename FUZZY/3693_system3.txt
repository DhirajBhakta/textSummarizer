New Delhi, Apr 21 (PTI) Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad today said Muslims do not vote for the BJP, but the government has given them "proper sanctity". 
As IT minister, Prasad said, he has visited many Muslim-dominated villages where many Muslim youth are running Common Service Centres which help people avail of government services through Internet. 
The minister cited the example of Prime Minister Narendra Modi short-listing a Muslim tea garden labourer in Jalpaiguri, Karimul Haque, for his exemplary work. 
If there are certain uncalled for voices, the Prime Minister addresses the concerns, the CMs (chief ministers) address concerns. 
"They are left out in Bengal, are surviving in Kerala and Tripura, but the Left has got a very good campus in Delhi, which is the JNU (Jawaharlal Nehru University) and I always say the Left also needs some consolation prize.
