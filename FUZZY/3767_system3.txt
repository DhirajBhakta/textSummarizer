Ranbir Kapoor's new look from Sanjay Dutt's biopic has gone viral online but his onscreen wife Dia Mirza feels it should not have been leaked. 
It was leaked by the media... 
I will admit it was upsetting that the look was out as we were saving the look to reveal much later. 
In the Rajkumar Hirani-directed film, Dia plays the role of Maanayata, Dutt's wife. 
Rajkumar Hirani had directed me in Lage Raho Munnabhai and it was great to be working with him again," she said, adding, "Right now we all are tight-lipped about the film but we can't wait to reveal things." 
The film also stars Vicky Kaushal as Sanjay Dutt's close friend, Manisha Koirala as Nargis Dutt and Paresh Rawal as Sunil Dutt.
