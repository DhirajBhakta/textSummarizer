Houston, Feb 12 (PTI) A quick-thinking golfer in the US hit life-saving shots with his putter when he used the club to save himself from the clutches of a 10-foot alligator. 
"As I was walking about 5 to 6 feet away from the water I heard a splash, and as soon as I heard that splash I knew it was an alligator, and he got me," Aarts was quoted as saying by WINK News. 
The alligator had grabbed Aarts by his right ankle and he rolled into the nearby water hazard as they struggled. 
"I remember having a club in my hand, and as soon as he had me in the water up to my waist, I started hitting him over the head," Aarts said. 
The alligator did not give up easily and soon the water was up to Aarts chest. 
"He was looking at me with his big eyes, and I kept hitting him. 
And Im thinking Im getting deeper and deeper, and I thought youre not gonna get me," he was quoted as saying. 
However, Aarts then went for the reptiles eye socket with his club which finally saved him. 
"I started hitting him in the eye socket. 
I hit him three times and he let go of my foot, so I crawled back out and by that time the guys were there," he said.
