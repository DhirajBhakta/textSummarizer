s Swachh Bharat Abhiyaan. 
While Akshay and his co-star Bhumi Pednekar are yet to start ground promotions for the film, it looks like fans have already started spreading the word.One of the most remarkable fan tributes is a rap video, with quirky lyrics and peppy beats, made by Abhishek Bhatt aka ABRK. 
He says that the video is dedicated to ?
Mr. 
Akshay Kumar?. 
Abhishek posted the video on YouTube and wrote: ?
It?
s time to be a part of Keshav [portrayed by Akshay] and Jaya?
s [portrayed by Bhumi] anokhi love story! 
Presenting my own made Rap of Toilet- Ek Prem Katha.?
Addressing ?
Dear Akshay Sir?
, Abhishek?
s message further read: ?
I hope you?
ll see this video. 
You are my inspiration. 
I am one of the biggest fan of yours (sic).? 
He also wrote that he has made the video to ?
thank Mr. 
Khiladi for always inspiring us?.
While Abhishek only hoped that his idol would watch the video, he probably never expected Akki to acknowledge his gesture by not only sharing the video on Twitter but also giving a ?
salute? 
to the fan who made it. ?
Salute to you Mr. 
#ABRK,? 
Akshay posted on Twitter, along with the fan?
