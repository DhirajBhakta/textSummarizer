Lucknow, Dec 24 (PTI) Taking a dig at Narendra Modis demonetisation move, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav termed cashless economy as a "bigger dream" than achche din and said the note ban will be an issue in the upcoming Assembly elections in the state. 
"The dream of cashless economy is a bigger one than achche din... it is however for the government to see how it will be realised," he said at a function to distribute cheques to the families of martyrs and 14 persons who allegedly lost their lives while standing in queues outside ATMs/banks after demonetisation. 
"It is for the government to see how it will work out the losses to the GDP but it is a fact the people had to face hardships and I have said earlier too that the government which pose problems are voted out by people," he said, adding that in the coming elections those who had faced problems will stand against them.
