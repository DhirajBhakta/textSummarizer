Ranbir feels that when he is going to have kids, he is not going to be like me. 
It's a generation gap. 
I cannot be a friend to a son. 
For me Raj Kapoor was not only a father. 
He was my guru, whatever I am today is because of him. 
When we were kids we knew that we were children of someone very important because wherever we went people looked at us as Raj Kapoor's sons," Rishi said.Rishi added that he never argued with his father Raj Kapoor and the kind of relationship he had with him, he passed on to the one between Ranbir and himself.
