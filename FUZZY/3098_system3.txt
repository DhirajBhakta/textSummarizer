Pakistan continues to provide breeding ground to banned terror groups such as the? Taliban and Haqqani network despite, a top US think tank has said, adding that Islamabad must be told that it faces the risk of sanctions if it fails to take decisive action against terror operators. 
"Afghanistan is currently doing badly both in the fighting and in its civilian politics, governance, and poverty. 
No commitment should be open ended. 
The Afghans have to do far more, and do it far better, to justify each future year of US commitment," it said."
It should make it clear that it can and will leave in the face of Afghan failure. 
If necessary, the United States should make good on such a threat," it said."
It should send a clear message to all 'partner states' that they must meet reasonable standards of performance. 
The United States should never bully its allies, but it also should not be bullied -- or let nations slip into the kind of overdependence that ultimately undermines rather than aids them," the CSIS said.
