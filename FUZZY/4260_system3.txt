Vishwajit P Rane, the Congress MLA from Valpoi and the leader of opposition in the outgoing Assembly, has announced he is quitting the party. 
I am very disillusioned with the way the Goa scenario was handled is very shameful," he said. 
He indicated that more MLAs could follow in his footsteps, saying, "Congress MLAs are disgusted." 
Reacting to the news, Congress spokesperson KC Venugopal, while admitting that the Congress's strategy in Goa will have to be rethought, said, "Nobody will leave the Congress." 
"(BJP leader Nitin) Gadkari could take the decision, why not our seniors?" 
Rane questioned. 
Gadkari played a vital role in ensuring that BJP formed the government. 
Rane, "I told Digvijay Singh (Congress general secretary) that I am done with the working of the Congress party." 
He went on to echo Singh's claims about money having played a role in BJP's post-poll alliance. 
"They (BJP) were auctioning posts for the leader of the legislative party, it was very shameful," Rane claimed. 
Rane signed off, saying the post-result fiasco would cost the Congress dearly in the future. 
"People in my constituency say...they have blacklisted the congress party, my voters say they will not accept the Congress again."
