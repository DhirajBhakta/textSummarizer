Delhi Police special cell on Friday arrested two persons, reportedly associated with the ISI and seized Rs 6 lakh in fake Rs 100 notes that they were allegedly trying to funnel into India from Nepal.According to sources the consignment worth Rs 6 lakh of FICN (fake Indian currency notes) was smuggled from Nepal to India. 
One of the main aims of demonetising high value bank notes  was to stop fake currency being pumped into the economy. 
But a spate of seizures recently, including some  of high denominations, indicate that  counterfeiters do not seem to have been hit hard.Last month, the Special Cell of Delhi Police arrested three men and claimed to have busted a fake currency printing racket.
