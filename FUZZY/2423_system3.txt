MusicAloud (@MusicAloud) July 9, 2017Rahman, who won the Oscar in 2009 for his work in Danny Boyle?
s Slumdog Millionaire, accepted the award on stage with a speech in Tamil. 
He was born in Chennai and is also called the Mozart of Madras. 
He may be best known for his work in Bollywood films but he has also composed music for films in several other languages. 
His first project was the Tamil original, Roja.Even Rahman?
s concert was titled Netru Indru Naalai, Tamil for ?
yesterday, today, tomorrow.?
Several other fans of the musician flocked to his defence on Twitter and schooled those complaining how this is a classic example of ?
imposing Hindi? 
on South Indians.AR Rahman performs Tamil songs, did'nt perform any in Hindi. 
Not able to tolerate an hour of music in another language #stopHindiImposition pic.twitter.com/UCQDhCiOQh?
