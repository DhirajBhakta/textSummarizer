Taapsee Pannu, who will be seen alongside superstar Salman Khan in a song in Judwaa 2, says it is important to work with top actors as they have higher market value. 
The second instalment of 1997 hit film Judwaa has cameo of Salman and he recently shot for a song with Varun Dhawan, Jacqueline Fernandez and Taapsee. ?
It is essential to work with actors or actress including Khans or not Khans as they have a higher market value. 
I got to meet him for the first time (while shooting for the song). 
With the life and career that he has, he has some interesting anecdotes to share I hope I get to hear more of that.?
