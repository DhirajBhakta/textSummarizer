But once you enter the premises, it becomes clear that something else is amiss. 
The school is erringly quiet ? 
there are no children on the small playground or, for that matter, in the classrooms.The Government Upper Primary Sanskrit School in Pratappura village has six classrooms, four teachers ? 
but not a single student. 
The teachers report for work at about 8am, water the plants, read newspaper, chat among themselves and leave after 2pm. 
They get their salary on time, but are not happy about the state of affairs.?
We feel ashamed to be sitting idle the whole day. 
Sanwarmal, the school?
In 2005, the student strength peaked to 55 and then gradually began to decline. 
Sanwarmal said.All the teachers are now sick with boredom. ?
There is nothing to do here. 
We gave a written request many months ago, but no action has been taken in this regard. 
We were told that deputations have been stopped for now,? 
Sanwarmal said. 
Some of the students have become doctors and engineers and one of them is a senior police official. 
But now there is little hope. 
The chances of the school?
s revival are very slim,? 
he said.As if to emphasise his point, a stray dog wanders inside the premises to be quickly shooed away by one of the teachers.
