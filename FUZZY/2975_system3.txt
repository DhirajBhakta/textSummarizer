terror By Lalit K Jha Washington, Jun 17 (PTI) Two top lawmakers have accused Pakistan of supporting terrorism and urged the Trump administration to cut military aid to the country, saying the US should make it more difficult for Islamabad to get its hands on American weapons. 
"We need to go on the record here, on this part of our government, to say that were not going to be providing weapons to countries like Pakistan that were afraid will shoot down our own people and afraid we know theyre engaged in terrorism," Rohrabacher said during a House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Terrorism, Non-proliferation and Trade hearing on Foreign Military Sales. 
Congressman Ted Poe, Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Terrorism, Non-proliferation and Trade, said that the US is having the issue with Pakistan whether "theyre loyal or playing us for years on the issue of aid" to Pakistan and sales to Pakistan. 
But are we doing anything different on sales to Pakistan to make sure those sales of whatever it is arent used against us directly or used against us indirectly because of the military helping the Taliban in Afghanistan where were have our troops and those weapons could be used against the United States?"
