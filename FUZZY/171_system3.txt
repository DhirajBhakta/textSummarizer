s tallest Tricolour which was fluttering at a height of 360 ft near the India-Pakistan border at Attari has been out of sight for the past three months. 
The flag, which was repeatedly damaged due to high-velocity wind that flows at high altitude, was taken off by the Amritsar administration in April this year and has not been hoisted again ever since. 
I would speak to local bodies minister Navjot Singh Sidhu and I am sure we all will soon find a solution. 
Trust officials said a total of around Rs 9 lakh have been spent on the flag at the Ranjit Avenue and another Rs 6 lakh on the Tricolour at the border.
