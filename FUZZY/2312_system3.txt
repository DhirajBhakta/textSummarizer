Terming the condition of such schools ?
pitiable? 
and ?
ridiculous?
The direction came while the bench was hearing a public interest litigation claiming that 793 children had died over the past 10 years in various ashram schools. 
The reasons for these deaths ranged from snake bites to fevers to other illnesses. ?
This is really ridiculous. 
The state government is obligated to provide basic facilities. 
It is the government?
s duty and responsibility. 
Except passing hollow resolutions, the government has done little to improve the condition,? 
the bench said. ?
Immediate action must be taken to provide basic facilities such as clean and adequate number of toilets, drinking water facility, medical treatment, beddings and mattresses in hostels etc. 
The government must also appoint a female warden in each school that has girl students,? 
the bench said.
