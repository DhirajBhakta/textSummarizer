The parliamentary board meeting was expected to name the leader who would be UP chief minister but the suspense will stay here for another three days.The BJP won with a massive majority in this Assembly election with 325 of the 403 seats going into its kitty. 
The decision rests with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP president Amit Shah.An hour before the announcement, Prime Minister Narendra Modi told a gathering of supporters at the BJP headquarters that a "new India" was emerging and it stood for development.He struck a reconciliatory note after a very divisive and aggressive election campaign in Uttar Pradesh when he said government was of those who voted for the BJP and also of those who did not.
