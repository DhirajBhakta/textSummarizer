New Delhi, Jan 15 (PTI) Army Chief Gen Bipin Rawat today said jawans who take to social media to express their complaints could be punished as their act lowers the morale of those guarding the frontiers of the country. 
He also said that despite Pakistans continuous engagement in proxy war against India, "we want to restore peace on the Line of Control". 
"But we will not hesitate from giving a fitting reply in case of any ceasefire violation," he asserted. 
The Army Chief was addressing the Army Day celebrations here, where he awarded gallantry medals to soldiers who showed extraordinary courage while performing duty. 
"If any jawan has any grievance, he has been provided with the proper forum to resolve his issue and maintain a balance. 
If you are not satisfied with the action, then you can contact me directly," Gen Rawat said.
