Ahead of the crucial Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) polls, the State Election Commission has directed the chief secretary, GNTCD and all the three municipal commissioners to take action with regards to the removal of the words 'Aam Aadmi from all forms of display. 
The directive seeks removal of the words Aam Aadmi from all forms of displays including Aam Aadmi Clinic and Aam Aadmi Express bus service as demanded by Leader of Opposition Vijendra Gupta. 
The party, which lost in the recently held Assembly elections in Punjab and Goa, is leaving no stone unturned to ensure maximum outreach ahead of the MCD polls.
