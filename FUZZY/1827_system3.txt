Instead of fishing for cash in their pockets to donate at temples, devotees can use  mobile phones to transfer donations to the e-wallets of the holy places. 
Not being able to collect enough donations due to the cash crisis, temples in Indirapuram have provided the option of e-wallets. 
When the note ban was announced many people donated old notes. 
In November,  since many were donating Rs500 or Rs1,000 notes, we did not have to worry much as we would then deposit them with the bank. 
Pandey said the number of people holding community feasts has also reduced.?
Money from community feasts (bhandara) used to be a major source of donations as one such feast would get us between Rs3,000 and Rs5,000.
