Although the print and paper quality of the seized counterfeits was poor, they resembled genuine notes.The officials said the change of security features of currency notes in every 3-4 years will lead to curbing of counterfeiting to a great extent.Those who were arrested recently along with fake notes with face value of Rs 2,000 have told investigators that the notes were printed in Pakistan with the help of the Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) and had been smuggled into the country through Bangladesh, the officials claimed.A study conducted by the Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata, in 2016 pegged the value of fake Indian currency notes in circulation at Rs 400 crore.
