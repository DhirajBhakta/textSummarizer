Monday Night #Raw has plenty of LIVE microphones... 
#MayMacWorldTour@thenotoriousmma@FloydMayweatherThe much awaited battle between McGregor and Mayweather is all set to take place on August 26.Both fighters in June took to social media to confirm the development, while Mayweather posted to Instagram saying "It's official!"
, McGregor said "THE FIGHT IS ON," on Twitter.Both McGregor and Mayweather kicked off a four-city, three-country international press tour, the first of which took place at the Staples Center in Los Angeles on Wednesday.Mayweather, who is coming out of retirement to fight McGregor, had earlier said that he cannot pay off his tax liability from 2015 until he fights the MMA star.As per the Guardian, during the press conference, McGregor made fun of Mayweather's clothes, mocked his unpaid tax bill and promised to knock the boxing great out in less than four rounds.However, the American then got to shadowboxing, which amused McGregor.Seeing this, McGregor laughed so much, brought the microphone to his lips and said, "Dance for me, boy!"
Meaweather, who was clearly pissed by McGregor's comment, stopped shadowboxing and started to stalk towards the latter, who quickly changed his tune."
Dance for me, son! 
Dance for me!" 
McGregor called out as Mayweather returned to the podium.
