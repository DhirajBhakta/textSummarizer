A man was arrested by the Amboli Police for giving an advertisement in a Marathi newspaper for converting black money into white on a minimal commission basis.A 44-year-old man gave the advertisement in a leading Marathi newspaper of the state which read that anyone who wants to get their old Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes converted at very minimal commission can contact him and the entire process will be done at the person's doorstep. 
The cops, with the given contact, traced the accused from Kolhapur. 
But the question still remains as to how a leading newspaper published such an advertisement for three consecutive days. 
According to the FIR accessed by India Today, the advertisement read, 'We will change your old notes i.e. 
Rs 500 and Rs 1000. 
Everything will be done at your doorstep'.
