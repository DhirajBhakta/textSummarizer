On March 7, 1987, a quick single nudged through the slips to a Pakistani bowler named Ejaz Fakih took Sunil Manohar Gavaskar from his innings score of 57 to 58 at the Sardar Patel Stadium in rural Motera outside Ahmedabad. 
He sprinted. 
Or at least that's what it seemed like to millions watching TV because it was an accomplishment that all of India wanted to own quickly. 
So we believe that in that instant, this deliberate, determined Indian batsman was quicker than usual. 
His head slightly lowered, mid-single, Gavaskar raised his bat in both triumph and celebration. 
So 10,000 had been achieved but to not extend that innings of 63 irked him. 
No wonder, even in the dry state of Gujarat that night, they sourced some champagne to go with the cake. 
When he retired later that year, the country was in deep gloom: Indian cricket's defender, its most gritty general had gone. 
He had re-defined the standards of excellence and professionalism, re-written definitions in the school of Indian batsmanship.
