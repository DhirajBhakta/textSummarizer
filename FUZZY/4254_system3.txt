When criticised for his tweets, Ramu said that his tweets were meant to be appreciative of Jackie and that his wife (and Tiger's mom) Ayesha shouldn't be taking his tweets to heart.Recently, at an event, when Jackie Shroff was asked to comment on Ramu's rather harsh words about his son, the veteran actor said, "He spoke about my son but that doesn't mean I will go and fight with him."
I wish all the women in the world give men as much happiness as Sunny Leone givesFair enough. 
Jackie also had an interesting opinion on RGV's Women's Day tweet. 
He knows what he is talking about... 
But I will not say such a thing about a lady. 
It's his thinking."
While Ramu's tweets were being seen as vile, disgusting and sexist, Tiger Shroff took RGV's criticism on a positive note. 
He was quoted as saying, "I am not even half the man that my father is. 
He is the original hero. 
Even if I tried, I can't be like him. 
But everyone has the freedom of speech. 
He is a senior director, so, there's not much I can say to him."
