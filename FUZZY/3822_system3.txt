The Haryana government on Wednesday transferred 19 IAS officers, including state's senior bureaucrat Pradeep Kasni who witnessed a record 68 transfers in his 33 years of service.Out of 68 transfers, 13 transfers were ordered by the present BJP government during the last 2.5 years. 
He was transferred 68th times on Wednesday and posted as chief executive, Haryana Khadi and Village Industries Board in place of Garima Mittal, who goes as director, Elementary Education and Additional Secretary, School Education Department relieving S.S.Phulia of the said charge.The 1997-batch IAS officer faced as much as three transfers within a period of one month during September 2016.In some of the transfers he was given relatively unimportant departments too. 
The series of? transfers have put a question mark on the working of BJP government which had claimed transparency and a corruption-free government. 
Kasni was shunted out within a month as Gurgaon Divisional Commissioner in September 2016 after he exposed a nexus between the revenue officials and the builders.The state government termed the transfers as 'routine' .
