For more than 17 years, a family of five from Goregaon (East) has been planting saplings across Aarey Milk Colony during the monsoon and caring for them till they become full-grown trees. 
They have so far planted 5,500 saplings. 
Over the next 15 years, he planted more than 3,500 saplings at Panchavati, New Zealand hostel, VIP guest house, Gaondevi Road and MHADA Road. ?
The garden has 700 trees now with 70 nectar plant species, including Jamaican spike, lemon, jathropha, pentas, exoras and many other species. 
he said, adding that his son Malhar has planted saplings all by himself and loves to be in the company of butterflies.Their efforts come at a time when Aarey is being besieged by several development projects. 
Initially, we bought our own saplings and planted them, but after a while we began receiving donations and saplings from different groups that joined us on weekends,?
