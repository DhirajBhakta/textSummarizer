New Delhi, Jun 26 (PTI) The World Bank has cleared a USD 250-million loan for making Indian youth more employable through reskilling, in a move that is seen to aid the Skill India mission. 
"The USD 250-million Skill India Mission Operation (SIMO), approved by the World Bank board of executive directors, will increase the market relevance of short-term skill development programmes (3-12 months or up to 600 hours) at the national and state level," the Bank said in a release. 
"This programme will support the governments vision of investing in the human capital of Indias youth, enable greater off-farm employment and increase womens participation in the labour market," World Bank Country Director to India Junaid Ahmad said.
