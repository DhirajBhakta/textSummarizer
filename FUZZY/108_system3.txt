(Eds: Updating with fresh quotes) By K J M Varma Beijing, Aug 1 (PTI) China will never seek "aggression or expansion" but will not allow anyone to "split its territory", President Xi Jinping asserted today as he lauded the Armys strong resolve to protect the countrys sovereignty and defeat "all invasions" amid territorial disputes with its neighbours. 
"No one should expect us to swallow the bitter fruit that is harmful to our sovereignty, security or development interests," Xi said as the Peoples Liberation Army (PLA) is engaged in a standoff with Indian troops at Doklam in the Sikkim section since mid-June. 
Though there was no direct reference to the Sikkim standoff, Xi urged the PLA to focus on war preparedness to forge an elite and powerful force that is always "ready for the fight, capable of combat and sure to win".
