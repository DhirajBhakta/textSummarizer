New Delhi, the capital has lived up to its fearful reputation of disappearing kids with over 1,500 children -- mostly between 6 and 15 -- reported missing in the first five months of this year, according to police figures.And only few are expected to return home, going by the past trends on tracing missing children.The latest data follows the disturbing trend of over a dozen children going missing in the capital each day and despite CCTV cameras and hi-tech aids, Delhi Police are finding it difficult to locate them.The success rate of Delhi Police is unimpressive, with a majority of the located children being those who return home on their own, according to crime record data.Deputy Commissioner of Police Rajan Bhagat said that the missing children mostly are in the age group of 6 and 15 and belong to economically weaker familes of downmarket areas of Delhi."
