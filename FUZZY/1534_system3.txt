s rescue operation came after raids at the same brothel in August in which the couple was arrested. 
Afaq and Saria are allegedly the influential operators who control everything from a distant location through handpicked brothel managers.?
the crime branch said in August.The Delhi Police has also proposed to seal the brothel owned by the couple and the matter is pending in the court.?
At the time of rescue, our team had asked the girls if they wanted to come with us as there are many adult girls who prefer to stay. 
said a senior crime branch official.The victims, most of whom are minors from poor families, are trafficked from Nepal and various other parts of the country by agents in an organised manner.
