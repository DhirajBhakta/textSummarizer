Stating that there were too many ICC events at present, Ravi Shastri felt there was no need to conduct the Champions Trophy, which is scheduled in England from June 1."
If you ask me, five years down the line there will be very little 50-over cricket. 
There are too many ICC tournaments. 
Which event (sport) has so many World Champions," said the former Indian team director on Monday. 
I go and meet anyone on the street and am asked 'kitna World Cup hai yaar' (how many World Cups are there), 'World Champion hai kaun' (who is the World Champion), which is a fact. 
You have both the Champions Trophy and the World Cup. 
You are (thus) diluting the World Cup," he said."
World Cup, T20, Test cricket are fine. 
What do you need Champions Trophy for? 
What are you trying to prove? 
Who remembers (who won them in the past)?"
I don't have a clue and I have broadcast (commentated) in all of them. 
That you will (always) remember," he pointed out.
