Officials immediately deployed another train to tow away the affected rake. 
The power failure on Monorail track in the city led to emergency evacuation of coaches at Chembur station in the evening. 
Passengers who were inside the rake that suffered power failure were helped out using the keys of the monorail staff. 
The pictures of the trains led to speculation that the two rakes came face-to-face and a head-on collision was averted but MMRDA authorities denied reports that two monorail trains nearly crashed. 
UPS Madan, MMRDA Chief said, "One Monorail rake lost power before it could reach the Chembur station, due to which we had to send another to rake to push it so that the rake could reach Chembur station.
