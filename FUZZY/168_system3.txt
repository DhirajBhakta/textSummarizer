The government had asked Delhi University to form governing bodies before making any appointments.The university is currently in the process of hiring permanent faculty.?
I can not allow unchecked corruption and irregularities to be sustained on Delhi govt funds in the name of Education. 
deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said in a series of tweets on Monday.Hv ordered Fin Dept to stop funding for Delhi gov funded 28 DU colleges, as DU not willing to form governing bodies for last 10 months.? 
Everything from payment of salaries to teaching and non-teaching staff to payment of electricity bill is done through Delhi government?
s funds. 
If we don?
t get the funds the college will have to stop,? 
t be any immediate impact on any of these colleges.?
We receive funds of about Rs24-25 crores in four instalments ? 
July, November, January, and March. 
We have already received the first instalment, so there won?
t be any immediate impact and the matter will hopefully be resolved in a few weeks,? 
Garg said.Dean of Colleges Devesh K Sinha said they have written a letter to the government on Monday assuring them that the governing bodies will be formed within a week or two.?
The executive council had raised certain objections to the nominations. 
We are supposed to have a variety of experts in the body but the government, for instance, had recommended five educationists to one college. 
However, we are in the process and soon the bodies will be formed,? 
Sinha said.He said that the government?
s main concern is that the governing bodies should be formed before the appointments. ?
Anyway the appointments are not happening before September so there is time,? 
duly constitute? 
the governing bodies, which will include five members nominated by the government, before making any appointments.DU colleges have been advertising vacant faculty positions following a High Court order.
