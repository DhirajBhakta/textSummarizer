Snapdeals board is believed to have rejected a takeover offer of USD 800-850 million (around Rs 5,500 crore) from larger e-commerce rival Flipkart. 
According to sources privy to the development, Flipkart has completed the due diligence process and has made an offer of USD 800-850 million to buy Snapdeal. 
However, the offer was rejected by the Snapdeals board which felt the amount undervalues the company as the due diligence report is clean. 
The deal between Snapdeal and Flipkart, if completed, would mark the biggest acquisition in the Indian e-commerce space. 
One of the leading contenders in the Indian e-commerce space, Snapdeal has seen its fortunes failing amid strong competition from Amazon and Flipkart. 
Compared to a valuation of about USD 6.5 billion in February 2016, the sale to Flipkart could see Snapdeal being valued at about USD 1 billion.
