Reacting to the controversy, Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) has slammed the state government for having failed to remove the hoardings and maintaining a stoic silence over the efforts being made by the Khalistani groups to revive terrorism. 
WHO IS BEHIND THESE CAMPAIGNS?
BJP claimed the hoardings were put up by a Canada and US based NGO Sikhs For Justice (SFJ). 
It is the same organisation which had opposed Captain Amarinder Singh's election campaign in Canada."
While at one hand the Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh is vocal against the Khalistani elements including Sikhs for Justice, his government's silence over the referendum hoardings is deplorable," Secretary BJP, Vineet Joshi said.BJP has appealed the state government to remove the hoardings immediately and threatened to destroy them in case the local administration did not act immediately.
