With the rapid increase in digitisation across all spheres, the message of internet safety needs to be integrated into the everyday tasks that the consumer undertakes online. 
This initiative will add to our existing campaigns guiding users to navigate the web and manage their digital lives safely and leverage the web to the fullest," Chetan Krishnaswamy, who is country head, Public Policy at Google India said. 
Google's Digitally Safe Consumer campaign is expected to roll out sometime in January, 2017 and will "reach out with training materials to over 1,200 consumer organisations as well as consumer affairs department of every state and union territory."
