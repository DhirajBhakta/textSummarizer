New Delhi, Jul 26 (PTI) The railway ministry today cancelled a caterers contract after a passenger found a dead lizard in his vegetable biryani served on a Delhi-bound train from Howrah, a ministry spokesperson said. 
The passenger had ordered and eaten the dish without noticing the lizard but felt unwell later, a co-passenger, Meghna Sinha, said in a series of Tweets yesterday. 
"In view of the Railways zero tolerance policy towards poor quality and overcharging of food, the railway administration has terminated the contract of the catering contractor, R K Associates, for the Howrah-New Delhi Poorva Express," Railway Ministry spokesperson A K Saxena told PTI. 
The spokesperson said in the last six months, the administration had terminated the contracts of eight catering units.
