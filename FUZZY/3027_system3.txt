Washington, Jun 13 (PTI) Scientists are developing a new system that can predict if a car driver is about to have a heart attack, a feature that would help avoid road accidents due to an unexpected cardiac event. 
Researchers, in collaboration with Japanese automotive manufacturer Toyota, wanted to move towards technology that can monitor and analyse the physiology of the person driving and predict if they are going to have adverse cardiac events. 
You need to use a high-quality monitoring device in the vehicle that, despite all the in-vehicle noise, could reliably register the drivers ECG without being large and obtrusive," he added.
