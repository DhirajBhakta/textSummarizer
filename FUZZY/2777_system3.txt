Berlin, Jun 30 (PTI) Scientists have developed magnetic microbots with silver nanoparticles that can zoom around contaminated water and clean up disease-causing bacteria. 
Drinking water contaminated with pathogenic bacteria can cause serious illnesses that, in areas with spotty medical services, are potentially life-threatening without proper treatment. 
Treating water with a combination of disinfectants or increasing their concentrations can help. 
However, they remain in the water, and their byproducts can be harmful to human health. 
In recent years, researchers have been exploring the use of self-propelled micromotors to degrade and capture pollutants in water. 
Building on this work, researchers from Max-Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems in Germany and Institute for Bioengineering of Catalonia (IBEC) in Spain wanted to see if they could engineer tiny robots to remove waterborne bacteria. 
The team designed "two-faced" spherical particles to perform the task.
