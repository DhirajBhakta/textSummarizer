Chennai, Mar 14 (PTI): Alarmed that "Tamil Nadu may become another Punjab one day" due to easy availability of tobacco products to young students, the Madras High Court today asked authorities to conduct preventive raids to check the malady. 
"If this situation is allowed to continue, one day Tamil Nadu might become another Punjab," observed Justice N Kirubakaran while passing orders on a plea detailing the malady of the shopkeepers selling tobacco products to students and people smoking in public places. 
The bench asked the authorities to seize tobacco products as per Section 14 of the Cigarettes and other Tobacco Products (Prohibition of Advertisement and Regulation of Trade and Commerce, Production, Supply and Distribution Act, 2003).
