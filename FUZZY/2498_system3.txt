The Bureau for Civil Aviation Security (BCAS) conducted dummy checks at Delhi, Pune and few other airports over the past three months. 
Parts of an improvised explosive device were put in a hand bag without a detonator, and civil aviation officials made an easy entry to the Delhi airport with it. 
To ensure that security at airports is at its best and personnel are well aware, we keep conducting dummy checks to know the level of alertness. 
In April, a drill was conducted where components of improvised explosive device were kept in a bag by a BCAS official. 
Though, we take action against our staff, the BCAS conduct dummy checks by keeping random items related with making a bomb.
