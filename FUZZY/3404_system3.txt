Washington, May 7 (PTI) Noise pollution caused by humans is pervasive in the US protected areas, posing a threat to land masses that harbour wildlife and provide places for respite, recreation, and natural resource conservation. 
This also means that what could be heard at 100 feet away could only be heard from 10 to 50 feet, researchers said. 
High levels of noise pollution were also found in critical habitat for endangered species, namely in endangered plant and insect habitats. 
"Although plants can not hear, many animals that disperse seeds or pollinate flowers can hear and are known to be affected by noise, resulting in indirect impacts on plants," said Buxton.
