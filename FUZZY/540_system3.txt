The committee had met BMC and traffic police department earlier this month to put forth their demands. ?
The civic official added that though there are more than 11,000 mandals across the city, only 20% of them seek permission to erect pandals during Ganeshotsav.The nine-page circular of the BMC policy was issued to all 24 administrative wards by civic chief Ajoy Mehta, last year, after the HC order.? It requires organisers to submit a location map with the sketch of the pandal mentioning its length, width and height.
