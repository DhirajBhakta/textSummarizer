The incident was reported from south east Delhi?
The murder was discovered after their landlord Anil Kumar came to meet Taiyab and found the door ajar. 
We received a call from a neighbour who told us that a man had murdered his wife. 
While Taiyab suspected her of having an extra marital affair, Shabnam denied being involved in a relationship outside marriage. 
He suspected that while he was out of India, his wife had an affair. 
He allegedly even checked her phone and always kept a watch on her which often led to arguments between the two,? 
a police officer said.On Friday morning the couple again had a fight after their kids went to school, following which Taiyab allegedly strangled his wife, left her body on the bed and fled the spot.
