Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said today that the cancellation of AAPs office allotment was part of a larger design to 'finish' the party. 
The office allotment to the AAP by the Kejriwal government was cancelled by the Delhi Lieutenant Governor yesterday after the Shunglu Committee pointed out 'irregularities' in the allotment. 
Kejriwal wondered why the Congress and the BJP, despite having negligible presence in the Delhi politics, have five and seven office spaces respectively, along with one plot each. 
"This must be the first time in independent India that a ruling party is being denied office space in the state where it is in power.
