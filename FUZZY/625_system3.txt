After sitting on the case for almost seven years, the Chennai Police recommended a CBI probe and transfer of case to Mumbai Police on grounds of, "territorial jurisdiction to Mumbai Police is legally sound and justified for effective and speedy investigation".But according to latest reports, Mumbai Police has returned the case to Chennai Police saying that the 'FIR was filed in Chennai'. 
Subsequently, the ED registered its ECIR under Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) under Sections 420 (cheating) and 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of Indian Penal Code (IPC).The case relates to Lalit Modi allegedly receiving a huge kickback in the form of diverting funds by switching TV rights contracts, cheating, criminal misappropriation and falsification of documents etc.Later, CBCID Chennai took up the investigation conducted by CCB Chennai under Section 409, 420, 468, 477, 120 (B) IPC.
