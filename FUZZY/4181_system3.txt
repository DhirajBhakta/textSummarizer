New Delhi, Mar 17 (PTI) A parliamentary panel today sought a probe into defunct Kingfisher Airlines allowed to accumulate high levels of dues to state-owned AAI, which was in "violation of all existing rules". 
At the end of December 2016, the airline owed dues worth Rs 294.69 crore to the Airports Authority of India (AAI) and the amount has been written off. 
Pulling up the AAI, the panel said it allowed the accumulation of dues to such a high level in violation of all the existing rules and procedures in practice. 
Besides, the committee has recommended that AAI may conduct an internal inquiry to "fix the responsibility of AAI officials for the accumulation of dues by Kingfisher Airlines".
