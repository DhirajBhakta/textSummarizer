Veteran actor Mithun Chakraborty says stand-up comedian Kapil Sharma is one of the biggest talents he has seen in his career. 
The 67-year-old actor would be seen in Krushna Abhishek?
s new show The Drama Company. 
Krushna?
s comedy show will air on the same channel, Sony, which has The Kapil Sharma Show.Krushna and Kapil are often pitched as competitors. 
Asked about the competition between them, Mithun, in an interview says, ?
How can it be competition as it is on the same channel. 
Will a producer wish that his one film should perform badly? 
I have no idea about it (referring to competition between the two comedians on Colors channel). 
But I feel no one should compare. 
His show is huge, it will take time (for Krushna?
s show) to reach there.?
Mithun, who was regular on TV with dance reality show Dance India Dance, took a sudden break from the small screen due to health issues. 
The actor, however, says the comedy show cannot be termed a comeback as he was continuously getting a lot of offers. ?
I stayed away from television as I was not physically fit. 
I wouldn?
t call it a comeback as the industry did not leave me, they wanted me. 
I couldn?
t do it so it is not a comeback. 
I am happy to be with them. 
Now, I want to do good work,?
