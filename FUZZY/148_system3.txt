Union minister for transport and shipping Nitin Gadkari has demanded that the Maharashtra government provide special facilities to those detained during the Emergency under the Maintenance of Internal Security Act (MISA). 
Incidentally, most of the MISA detainees are RSS activists or its supporters.The group submitted a memorandum to Gadkari, briefing him about the facilities and recognition extended to detainees in states like UP, MP, Bihar and Chhattisgarh. 
They claimed that in these states, the detainees are considered at par with the freedom fighters and given pensions and other facilities. 
The Congress, meanwhile, has accused the BJP-led government of trying to give such facilities to its Sangh Parivar members. ?
