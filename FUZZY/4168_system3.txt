Doing puja is a normal practice in Hindu tradition before starting on a new project," Ram Gopal Yadav said, reacting to reports on Yogi Adityanath getting a team of seven priests from Gorakhpur to perform puja at the CM's official residence at 5, Kalidas Marg in Lucknow.The Samajwadi Party leader also lauded Adityanath's directive to his ministers to declare their source of income and assets to the party and the chief minister's office within 15 days. 
However, once the election results were announced, father Mulayam Singh had defended son Akhilesh and said the responsibility for the defeat should not entirely fall on the young Yadav's shoulders.As father and son try to put up a united face after election, many expect the party to take some tough decisions to put the house in order.
