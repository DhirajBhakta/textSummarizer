From Lalit K Jha Charlottesville (US), Apr 13 (PTI) To transform Indias economy, there is a need to reduce "friction" in businesses and create an "environment" wherein the government has more trust in its entrepreneurs, Infosys founder N R Narayana Murthy has said. 
He, however, refrained from elaborating what the Indian government needs to do to create the environment of trust in its entrepreneurs and said, "I will tell you why, as an Indian citizen, it may not be proper if I were to be critical about India when I am outside India". 
"Therefore, todays entrepreneurs would have to be much more nimble, global, competitive because market is truly determinant for success today unlike our time when managing government was a big determinant in India," he said.
