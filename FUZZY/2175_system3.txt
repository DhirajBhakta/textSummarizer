A group 50 students and teachers on Monday staged protested at the University of Mumbai?
s (MU?
s) campus,Fort, against the delay in declaring degree college results. 
The protesters, led by Bombay University and College Teachers? 
Union (BUCTU), criticised the varsity?
as required by the law. 
They also voiced opposition to what they termed as ?
extreme harassment of examiners? 
by issuing ? 
threatening?  
letters to them.This year, the MU adopted an on-screen marking process for assessing answersheets against  the traditional pen-and-paper evaluation. 
Even after the process began, the technical glitches in the system slowed down the pace of assessment. 
t show up to assess papers, warning them of the consequences of skipping the assessment work.However, the teachers have  asked the varsity to revoke the letter. ?
It?
s not the teachers, but the university which is at fault here. 
We do report to Centralised Assessment Programmes (CAP) centres, but often there are no papers available for assessment on the server. 
Many of us are yet to be allotted CAP centres,? 
They will demand increasing the capacity of OSM, while advocating yet stronger intervention by the chancellor.
