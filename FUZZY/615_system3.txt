It was the bank who failed to take effective steps for blocking of the ATM card. 
It is thus a clear case of deficiency in service. 
The incident took place in March 2006 and the complainant has not received a single penny in a span of 11 years,? 
the judicial member of the state commission N P Kaushik said.It said that instead of making the payment to the complainant, the bank rather filed a ?
false and frivolous appeal?.?
the commission said.According to the complaint filed by Okhla resident Rahimunnisa Shahana, on March 13, 2006 her bag containing a new ATM card and an envelop having the pin number were stolen before she could even use it.
