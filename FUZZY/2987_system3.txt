The? 46-year-old actor in an interview to DNA said that he wants a more stable profession for his daughter.He told the daily, "Why would she want that for herself? 
Look at where she studied. 
After having done that, why wouldn't she want to live and work in New York, rather than do this? 
I am not looking down on acting, it's just it is not the most stable profession. 
And everyone lives in constant fear. 
And there is no guarantee that despite doing your best, you will succeed. 
This is not the life, any parent would want for their children."
I knew then that she wanted this for herself. 
Being on stage and people shouting her name," he added.However, the actor said that he was not involved in selecting Sara's first Bollywood project. 
"I am there if she needs to ask or talk to me about anything. 
I know what she is doing and we talk about films just like we do about everything else," said the Phantom actor.Sara will be seen in Abhishek Kapoor's Kedarnath. 
The film is set to go on floors by this year end.
