Dots and inverted commas have come to confound political parties, who are seeking to identify rebels during the 2017 presidential poll.

Senior BJP leader Bhupendra Yadav, counting agent for Kovind, said that a day before the poling, his party had made a presentation to its legislators on voting rules.?
