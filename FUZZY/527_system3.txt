The railway ministry plans to introduce its ambitious integrated ticketing system in the next three years and Mumbai will be the first city to experience it. 
Primarily a Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) project, the system will integrate all public transport ? 
Mumbai Rail Vikas Corporation (MRVC) and Central and Western Railway officials are currently studying different ways to sync the new software with the existing system. 
Railway authorities also hope the new ticketing system will reduce losses as it will need less manpower. 
With new Metro lines coming up in the city, MMRDA said the single ticketing system would be a boon to travellers.
