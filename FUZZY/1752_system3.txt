In a general body meeting of DMK in which M Karunanidhi didn't participate, for the first time in 48 years, MK Stalin was today elevated as 'working president' of DMK at its general body meeting in which party partriach M Karunanidhi didn't participate for the first time in 48 years.Stalin the second son of Dayalu Ammal and Karunanidhi had won over the internal battles within the party to become the 'working president'. 
It was believed that anytime a question on handing over authority to a successor was put forward to Karunanidhi, the Dravidian stalwart would only give an indirect reply keeping the leadership in uncertainty as he knew that it was the only thing that kept his family together at peace.But as his health deteriorated recently and with the death of former CM and AIADMK chief Jayalalithaa, Stalin's supporters raised flags within the party to make him the next leader.Party insiders were a bit appalled to know that the Stalin camp, demanded absolute power before becoming a working president.
