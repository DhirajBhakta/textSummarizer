To avoid beef shortage in Goa, chief minister Manohar Parrikar on Tuesday said the BJP-led government had kept open its option of importing it from Karnataka.Parrikar told the Goa assembly: ?
We have not closed the option to stop getting meat from Belgaum (in Karnataka) to ensure that there is no shortage. ?
I can assure you that inspection of beef from the neighbouring state will be done by a proper and authorised medical doctor, and not others,? 
The rest (of the beef demand) is met by Karnataka,? 
Parrikar said. ?
The government does not have any intention to restrict bringing animals for slaughter at the Goa Meat Complex from the neighbouring state.?
Beef is commonly consumed in the state?
s tourism belt as well as by Goa?
s population.
