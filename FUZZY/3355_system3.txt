His speech was witty, insightful and wise as always and one of the highlights of the twenty-minute long speech-a-thon was Shah Rukh Khan talking about his reaction to a rather idiotic rumour about him, his family and his youngest child, AbRam.Shah Rukh Khan began speaking about speculations and rumours about his life as a superstar and apparently, one of the rumours was that AbRam was the love child of SRK's eldest son Aryan Khan!
Shah Rukh Khan spoke, "Four years ago, my lovely wife Gauri and me decided to have a third child. 
Apparently, he had sowed his wild oats with a girl while driving his car in Romania. 
And yeah there was a fake video to go with it. 
And we were so disturbed as a family. 
As an afterthought, Shah Rukh Khan added that in the digital era, the virtual could emulate the real and the real could often be mistaken for the virtual."
Yeah, in this new world slowly reality became virtual and virtual became real and I began to realise I cannot say what I thought. 
And humanity at this time completely identified with me," Shah Rukh Khan said.
