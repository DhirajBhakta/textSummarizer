A day after the Madras High Court ordered a month-long stay on the Centre's ban on cattle sale for slaughter, the Kerala High Court today said there is no need for it to interfere with the new rules as it doesn't violate the Constitution.Kerala High Court Chief Justice Navniti Prasad said this while hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) which sought quashing of notification on ban on cattle sale for slaughter.The court said there is no constitutional violation in the order issued by the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change which has created an uproar in some states including Kerala.The Kerala High Court observed that there was nothing in the new central law on cattle trade and slaughter that takes away the rights of people with regard to eating beef."
