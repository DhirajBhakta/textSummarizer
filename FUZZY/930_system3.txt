Cinelovers were shocked when Aamir Khan's Dangal did not make it to the list of the IIFA 2017 nominations. 
Andre Timmins, the Director of Wizcraft International, told IANS, "So basically, in IIFA, forms are sent to various production houses. 
Those forms are then put out to the industry for voting and from there it becomes a nomination. 
Dangal has not sent their entry in."
He added, "We would love Dangal to be a part of it. 
We love Aamir Khan and the two little girls. 
While Neerja took home the award for Best Film, Aniruddha Roy Chowdhury won Best Director for his hard-hitting courtroom drama, Pink. 
Udta Punjab actors Shahid Kapoor and Alia Bhatt won the awards for Best Actor and Best Actress, respectively.
