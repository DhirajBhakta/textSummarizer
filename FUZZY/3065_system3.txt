Director, Ketan Mehta has filed a complaint of cheating against Kangana Ranaut at Mumbai's Economic Offences Wing (EOW). 
Mehta has claimed that Ranaut was on board for his dream project titled Rani of Jhansi: The Warrior Queen and also shot for it. 
Later, the actress replaced Mehta with another director and started shooting for a similar movie with a different title. 
Mehta has also sent a legal notice to Ranaut three weeks back. 
He has approached EOW, a financial crime investigation agency, a few days ago. 
"We have received the letter. 
We will investigate the case, and if the allegations are true we will register a case in this regard," said DCP Parag Manere, EOW. 
Ketan Mehta has not answered calls and messages.
