Doctors in the UK have found 27 contact lenses stuck in a 67-year-old woman's eye while they were preparing her for a cataract surgery.The lenses, which resembled a "blueish mass" in the patient's eye, were causing her discomfort that she simply attributed to dry eye and old age.The case happened in November last year but has just been reported in the British Medical Journal, according to metro.co.uk."
None of us have ever seen this before. 
It was such a large mass. 
She was quite shocked. 
When she was seen two weeks after I removed the lenses she said her eyes felt a lot more comfortable," Morjaria said.
