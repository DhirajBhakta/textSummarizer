The US is concerned about the state of India-Pakistan relations and President Donald Trump himself may get involved in a peace process between the two South Asian antagonists, Nikki Haley, the US Permanent Representative to the UN said on Monday."
This administration is concerned about the relationship between India and Pakistan and very much wants to see how we de-escalate any sort of conflict going forward," Haley, who holds a cabinet rank in the Trump administration, said."
I would expect that the administration going to be in talks and try and find its place to be part of that (process)."
She added, "And also wouldn't be surprised if the President participates as well."
India has opposed external involvement in bilateral issues with Pakistan.During his campaign in 2016, Trump had offered to mediate between India and Pakistan, but was careful to add that it was only if the two nations wanted him to.In an interview to The Hindustan Times he said that he "would be honoured" to be a moderator. 
"I think if they wanted me to, I would love to be the mediator or arbitrator."
Haley was answering a question from a reporter at her news conference on assuming the presidency of the Security Council for the month of April.The reporter pointed out that India does not want an interlocutor for talks with Pakistan, while Islamabad wanted the US or another country to facilitate talks between them and asked if the US would get the leaders of the two countries to talk.With Secretary of State Rex Tillerson keeping a low public profile and generally avoiding the media, Haley is emerging as the public face of US diplomacy making her presence felt in the media aided by her cabinet status.Her statement about India-Pakistan relations, therefore, assume importance and it is the first high-level Trump administration statement on India's relations with Pakistan.While it is not clear what steps the US could take, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to meet Trump in Washington in May when the two could discuss it.
