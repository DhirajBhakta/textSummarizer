Rashtriya Lok Samta Party MLA, Lallan Paswan who was caught on camera posing indecent questions to girl students in connection with alleged rape and murder of a Dalit girl, remained defiant asserting that the questions he posed to the girl students were relevant.Speaking exclusively to India Today, Paswan said he won't apologize for his conduct. 
He said, "Whatever questions I have asked to the girls are relevant and were important to get to the truth of the matter as there was another theory that the girl perhaps committed suicide."
The MLA who had gone to take stock of the situation in a bid to get to the truth asked indecent questions to the friends of the deceased girl."
From where was the blood coming out?"
