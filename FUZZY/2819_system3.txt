Last month, Rajinikanth, while addressing his fans, said he has no political aspirations but will consider taking the path "if it's God's will". 
His family is dead against bringing politics into Rajini's career. 
They cite the example of Amitabh Bachchan, who to this day, regrets his sticky stint in politics.""
He wishes to think over the issue, talk about it and explore the possibility. 
Even though there is a lot of pressure on him to get into active politics from many quarters, he is no hurry to bite the bait. 
He will be meeting old friends whose judgment he trusts, including Bachchan saab and discuss it with them," the source added. 
After all these years, will Thalaivar finally venture into politics? 
Only time will tell.On the work front, Rajinikanth will resume shoot of Kaala, which is being directed by Pa Ranjith.
