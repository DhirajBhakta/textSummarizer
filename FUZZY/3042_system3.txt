Three pythons in Kolkata's Alipore Zoo gave birth to 56 snakelings, thanks to the efforts of a team of skilled snake breeders hired by the zoo. 
Interestingly, all three pythons were of three separate species - Rock, Burmese and Reticulated.The Rock python laid two eggs, both of which hatched. 
The Burmese python laid 41 eggs in March of which 34 hatched in April. 
The Reticulated python laid 28 eggs, of which 20 hatched.Reticulated python is the longest snake species in the world and heaviest among the three.EGGS PRESERVED CAREFULLY These eggs were collected and sealed using various materials and carefully preserved at 30-33 degrees Celsius.Usually the number of eggs laid in one go is between 10-15 but this marks a bumper breeding for Alipore Zoo officials to boast about it.Ashish Kumar Samanta, Director Alipore Zoo explained, "We are very proud. 
We have made history. 
This is due to the sincere efforts of the team. 
The Burmese python laid around 35 eggs, the Reticulated python laid 20 eggs, and the Rock python laid two eggs. 
We carefully sealed the eggs and monitored the temperature conditions."
In this case the heat could have played a spoilsport but it was the use of technology and precision that has created history with the longest snake laying the highest number of eggs in Kolkata.
