(Eds: With additional quotes of BJP chief Amit Shah) Mumbai, Jun 17 (PTI) BJP president Amit Shah today ruled out resumption of bilateral cricket ties between India and Pakistan anytime soon, saying the two countries would continue to play against each other in international tournaments. 
"India and Pakistan will continue to play at international tournaments but neither India plays in Pakistan nor Pakistan plays in India," Shah, who heads the Gujarat Cricket Association, told reporters, a day ahead of the clash between the arch rivals in the Champions Trophy final in England. 
Shah, who is here on a three-day visit to strengthen the party organisation in the state, and is scheduled to meet Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray, said BJP would consult its allies before finalising the NDAs presidential candidate.
