Mumbai, Apr 4 (PTI) Actor Manoj Bajpayee says the credit for his success in the film industry goes to his "so called" flop movies. 
"Success doesnt teach you anything. 
Failures, rejections, they make you the man that you are. 
In my life, Ive mostly seen rejections and failures and flops. 
"You can count my hit films on your fingertips. 
The actor, best known for featuring in critically acclaimed films like "Satya", "Shool" and "Gangs of Wasseypur", says movies which do not work at the box office, are often the ones which have longer shelf life. 
"I am here because of those so called flop films as they were appreciated the most. 
They take me all around the world. 
Aligarh and Budhia Singh are still running in some pockets of the world."
