s iconic shopping arcade, Connaught Place is set to go car-free and become pedestrian-friendly from August even though traders opposed the move, fearing it would kill their business.An official of the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) who did not wish to be named said the council plans to carry out the pedestrian-only campaign in the weekends.?
We plan to close down vehicle movement from 4pm on Friday and will continue it on Saturday and Sunday. 
This will be a soft launch of sorts in August, after which we can proceed towards making CP a no-vehicle zone in phases based on the response,? 
the official told HT.?
We will study traffic flow, parking issues and experiences of pedestrians and shop owners,? 
We are absolutely against it. 
It is not practical at all to not allow vehicles inside Connaught Place. 
And this soft launch is the perfect way to kill business. ?
Saturday and Sunday and even Monday are the peak days for us. 
We will go all out to stop it. 
We can?
t allow them to kill our livelihoods,?
