When the moderator asked women in the room if they had ever been catcalled, a significant number of women raised their hands, according to Vandermeyden.Other women allegedly talked about feeling unsafe around male managers and facing sexist remarks from superiors. 
Women talked about being dismissed and talked over in meetings with no other female employees, and asked questions about diversity in hiring and the lack of women in leadership positions.Some of the executives seemed genuinely concerned and taken aback by the women?
Vandermeyden said she thought it was an opportunity to discuss ways to improve the workplace and address her concerns, but instead she was told she could resign and get a severance package or she would be terminated immediately and should not show up for work the next day.?
s termination was retaliation for raising concerns about workplace conditions, which is her legally protected right.In addition to saying she was not qualified for her job, Tesla has also repeatedly noted that Vandermeyden did not have an engineering degree, a fact many tech journalists have repeated in articles.
