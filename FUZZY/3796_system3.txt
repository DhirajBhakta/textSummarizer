New Delhi, Apr 13 (PTI) An employer, not a court, will decide whether a probationary employees services are satisfactory, the Delhi High Court has said. 
Justice Valmiki Mehta made the observation while upholding the termination of services of a teacher by a private school in the national capital. 
It said that since the man, who was appointed on April 4, 2011, did not complete three years of service in the school, he would not be entitled to be confirmed as an employee as was ruled by the Delhi High Court in another matter in 2013. 
The teacher was on probation from April 4, 2011 to March 5, 2014 when his services were terminated.
