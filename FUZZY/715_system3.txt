Or an acronym.So though Atletico Madrid won?

ATM (Atletico de Madrid) will sell their stake to me,? 
said Goenka. ?
ATM and ATK have come to an agreement that they will not be part of ATK going forward. 
We?
ve had a good relationship and we continue to be friends.?
Goenka pointed out that the Madrid club hadn?
t spent ?
a penny? 
Atletico Madrid provided technical support including but not restricted to the coaching staff. 
They facilitated the pre-seasons in Madrid and were a major help in recruiting foreign players. 
The consistency of their imports played a major role in ATK winning two championships and being the semi-finalists in another.?
We have competent technical team. 
Teddy (Sheringham) and Ashley (Westwood) bring a lot of experience, success and vision. 
And I hope we can fulfil expectation fans have from us. 
We have not let our fans down in the last three years,? 
said Goenka.?
Babes compared to Bagan, EB?
Goenka said even though the I-League and the ISL would be held simultaneously this season, there is no competition between ATK and Mohun Bagan and East Bengal in terms of garnering support. ?
Mohun Bagan and East Bengal are great clubs with great legacies. 
We?
ve grown up watching them, idolising them. 
We are not competing with anyone. 
They are ?
dadas?
, we are ?
bachchas?
