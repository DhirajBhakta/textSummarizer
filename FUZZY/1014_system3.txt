?After realising that Mane had gone missing, his friends informed others including Thermax workers union president who in turn asked his friend Sachin Gaikwad  for help. 
I told them to contact Velha police station and register a complaint and meanwhile, I called my friend Sachin Gaikwad who is known for rescue missions. 
?The rescue team realised that they were short in man power, as Mane was stuck in an inaccessible spot and it was not easy to pull him out to safe area. 
So, Gaikwad walked back to the village and contacted Shivdurg Mitra Pratishan of Lonavala and asked for technical help.
?Meanwhile, one of the rescuers managed to reach Mane, so the team acted swiftly and rather than waiting for the technical team, they brought Mane out with help from local villagers.??
