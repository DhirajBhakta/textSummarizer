The five-month-old toddler enjoys as much fan following as his mother Kareena Kapoor Khan. 
Ever since his birth in December last year, the tiny tot has become a favourite with the netizens. 
And the star kid is busy stirring up a storm on the internet once again. 
A new picture of him has caught the fancy of many. 
Clad in a stripped t-shirt, the tiny tot can be seen smiling for the camera. 
Interestingly, Taimur grabbed more eyeballs than the birthday boy himself. 
Going by his recent pictures, he looks almost a spitting image of Kareena. 
On the work front, Kareena is set to start shooting for Veere Di Wedding, which marks her comeback post pregnancy. 
Saif, meanwhile, is gearing up for the release of Chef in July.
