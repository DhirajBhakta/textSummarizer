Priyanka Chopra made a fleeting visit to India to read a few scripts, finalise her next Bollywood film, catch up with her friends and most importantly, to promote her big ticket Hollywood debut, Baywatch. 
Starring Dwayne Johnson, Zac Efron and a bevy of beauties, Baywatch has Priyanka Chopra playing the baddie, Victoria Leeds, and she has slayed it as the bad boss lady!
