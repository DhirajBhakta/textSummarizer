Ram Vilas Paswan, Union Minister of Food and Public Distribution, Consumer Affairs, tweeted about his meeting with Kerala CM Sh O Paneerselvam? Sh Pinarayi Vijayan.Yes, that's what happened.
?Paswan while tweeting mixed up Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan with Tamil Nadu CM O Paneerselvam and got trolled for the same. 
Someone even asked what would he have discussed during the meeting if he does not know who he met. 
Are u @irvpaswan competing with @OfficeOfRG ?????? 
https://t.co/E25GFeDCHI@irvpaswan LOL what an uninformed ministers Mr.Modi has chosen for his cabinet. 
Paneerselvam is CM of Tamil Nadu.
@VivekAchar@irvpaswan Mr. 
Paswan doesn't even know who he is meeting. 
So incompetent, he must resign ????

@ShivAroor Out of curiosity, if paswan had no clue who he was talking to, what on earth did they talk about??
