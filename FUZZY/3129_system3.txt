Ever since the trailer of Salman Khan's Tubelight released, a lot has been said about how the film would probably break Baahubali 2's records at the box office. 
Many are of the opinion that Tubelight will be able to pull this off as Salman has a huge fan following. 
He told IANS, "I want Tubelight to break records of Baahubali and become a superhit film. 
I feel Tubelight has all the capacity to make Hindi cinema proud all around the world and I would like to wish all the luck for the entire team of Tubelight."
The film, which is set to hit the screens this Eid, also stars Chinese actor Zhu Zhu and late Om Puri.
