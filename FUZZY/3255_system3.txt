China's real population may have been about 1.29 billion last year, 90 million fewer people than the official figure released by the National Bureau of Statistics," the South China Morning Post quoted Yi Fuxian, a scholar and demographer at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, as saying at a seminar in Peking University on Monday.Yi, who has been a critic of the Chinese government's family planning measures and warned of an upcoming ageing crisis for China, said that the government had overstated China's population since 1990. 
"The government has overestimated the birth rate and underestimated the speed of demographic changes," Li Jianxin, another demographer who is at Peking University, was quoted as saying by SCMP. 
Another scholar, Liang Zhongtang of the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences, also said official data wasn't accurate."
"The birth control policy which has last nearly four decades is not in accordance with reality. 
It is imperative that the government should abandon the family planning system."
