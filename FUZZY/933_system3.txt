The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) demolished 40 illegal food and clothing stalls and razed extensions of more than 100 stores near Santacruz station on Tuesday. 
An H/West ward official said 40 stalls that were blocking traffic were demolished at Tilak Road, MG Road and Kanubai Desai Road in Santacruz (west). 
The stores were in the allotted area but the sheds were encroached on footpaths, said an official who supervised the demolition. 
The action is part of a BMC drive against establishments setting up sheds and stalls that encroach onto public spaces ? 
Every monsoon, several establishments across Mumbai erect sheds without the civic body?
