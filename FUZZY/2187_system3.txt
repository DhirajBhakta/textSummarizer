H Rajesh Prasad, commissioner, trade and taxes department, however, said while the number of traders who have not been able to migrate due to the PAN mismatch is not much. ?
However, such traders are being advised to apply afresh and get a new application reference number and continue with trade,? 
Prasad said.Officials said while the department is making efforts to ensure all eligible traders are enrolled under the GST, the number of overall registered traders is likely to be corrected due to several reasons. ?
There is also a possibility other few accounts are either dormant or are no more eligible for the registration owning to the annual turnover cap,? 
The decision was taken after deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, who holds the finance portfolio, held a meeting with senior officers of the trade and taxes department on the implementation of the GST last week.
