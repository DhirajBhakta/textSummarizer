Instead, the app will enable payments through the fingerprint scanner, by authenticating the biometric details of a user with Aadhaar database. 
The app, which will be available for download to merchants across the country, will link your Aadhaar number and biometric fingerprint to complete a transaction. 
To enable the transactions through BHIM-Aadhar, merchants will have to purchase fingerprint scanners.With the implementation of the new system, all you will need is your fingerprint to make a payment. 
Using the Aadhaar number linked to your bank account, the payment for your purchase will be requested by the merchant but is finalised only when you keep your finger on the biometric machine connected to the app through the smartphone.
