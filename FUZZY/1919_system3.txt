s move is a change of stance as it had earlier allowed the already employed guest teachers to continue in the last two years.The move comes two days after a group of guest teachers protested against chief minister Arvind Kejriwal at a government function. 
The government is doing so much for the guest teachers and yet the teachers are playing politics. 
They did ?
chakka jam? 
outside the venue. 
This move will send a signal to teachers that this kind of politics will not be tolerated,? 
Principals? 
feedback will also  be taken while hiring the teachers,? 
said sources.After it came to power in 2015, the government ordered continuation of existing teachers, who were engaged in 2014, and the same teachers have been teaching in schools till now.?
They had to apply afresh the next year. 
The government stopped that system and allowed them to continue. 
But a small group of politically motivated guest teachers are holding these protests,?
