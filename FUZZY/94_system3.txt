The Maharashtra government on Tuesday admitted that adopting online assessment system  by the University of Mumbai (MU) for evaluating answer papers delayed declaration of results. 
The MU had recently shifted to an online system for assessment of answer papers, which caused a delay in completing the assessment work. 
Further delay in declaring results may also impact students who want to pursue higher education abroad, he added. 
???He also informed the assembly that of 17.50 lakh answer sheets, 14 lakh have been evaluated so far.
