Amitava Roy Kolkata, July 9 (PTI) The famous blue-bordered sari of Mother Teresa, who has been canonised as Saint Teresa of Calcutta by the Vatican, has been recognised as an Intellectual Property of the Missionaries of Charity. 
"The Trade Marks Registry, Government of India, has granted the registration of the trade mark for that pattern of blue border of sari," Intellectual Property attorney Biswajit Sarkar said. 
The exclusive right of use of the said blue pattern on white saris adopted by the Missionaries of Charity is unique and is the first time ever that a uniform has been protected under the Intellectual Property rights, the attorney said.
