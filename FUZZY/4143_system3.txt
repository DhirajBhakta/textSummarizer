But the latest buzz has Kangana will shooting for the biopic on her 30th birthday, but with another director. 
But Kangana, who also worked on the script, had a different opinion. 
A source was quoted as telling the daily, "Ketan was insistent that his movie be made in English for an international audience, like Gurinder Chadha's The Viceroy House, but those working on the film felt it won't go with the ethos of the story. 
It is the biopic of an ordinary girl, who when faced with tough times, discovered the warrior in her. 
The film will go on floors in mid-May," added the source.
