The institutes now have technology-driven teaching interface in all classrooms, bio-metric entry for students, paperless admissions and mobile apps for better teacher-parent interaction. 
The education society also plans to introduce online assessment of all examinations soon.?
Paperless admissions have not only reduced the work of our staff but have also made the process very transparent for everybody. 
Parents are also happy as they get daily updates about their child?
s attendance in college without even having to visit the institute,? 
said AH Rizvi, president, Rizvi Education Society. 
Also, CCTV cameras were installed in all its institutes and all laboratories were equipped with latest technology. ?
Our attempt to digitise almost all our academic functions right from admissions to the generation of results has been very fruitful. 
said Rubina Rizvi, director, Rizvi Education Society.
