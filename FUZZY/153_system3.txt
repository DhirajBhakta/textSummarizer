The Indian contingent of hearing impaired athletes, returning to the country after its best ever performance in the Deaflympics -- clinching five medals, including a gold -- refused to leave the Indira Gandhi International Airport in New Delhi on Tuesday morning (5 a.m.) after realising that not a single official from the Sports Authority of India (SAI) or the sports ministry were present to welcome them.The contingent of 46 athletes and support staff felt the apathy from the officials indicated that the government were not acknowledging their success at the Games held at Samsun, Turkey. 
These medal winners made the nation proud, but no one, not even the sports minister, is here to welcome us.?
