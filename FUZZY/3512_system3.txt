That Farhan is now legally divorced from Adhuna Bhabani has added fuel to the fire and it was being said that he is planning to make his relationship with Shraddha official soon. 
This comes after reports that the couple had moved in together, which led to Shraddha's father Shakti Kapoor forcibly dragging her back to their house."
I choose to ignore them and just focus on my work," Shraddha told Mumbai Mirror, responding to the reports of her alleged affair. 
She had told PTI that she is usually unfazed but involving her family was unfair. 
She will also be seen in Haseena (based on the life of Dawood Ibrahim's sister Haseena Parkar) and Saina (the biopic of ace badminton player Saina Nehwal).
