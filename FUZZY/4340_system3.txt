Jammu and Kashmir lost against Jharkhand on the field, but off it the cricketers from the northern valley emerged gainers when former India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni decided to spend some time with them answering their cricketing queries.A couple of years back, the J&K cricketers had a similar chance when Sachin Tendulkar dropped in at the Wankhede Stadium dressing room after they upset Mumbai in a Ranji Trophy gameIt was a nightmare of a tournament for J&K as they lost all but one match finishing last in their group. 
After being beaten by Jharkhand in a Vijay Hazare Trophy match, it was J&K skipper and India international Parvez Rasool who requested Dhoni to have a chat with the boys.On Rasool's request, the World Cup-winning skipper headed straight to the J&K dressing room and patiently listened to their queries spending about 15 minutes."
