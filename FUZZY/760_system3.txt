Cooperative banks in Pune and Nashik are left with Rs22.25 crore and Rs23 crore in scrapped notes, while Kolhapur has Rs25.27 crore. 
It is discriminatory that when the scheduled, centralized, urban banks were allowed to deposit their notes collected before demonetisation, only DCCBs were singled out. 
The stock with the DCCBs was verified by the National Bank For Agriculture And Rural Development on various occasions and they had found nothing objectionable. 
In case of some DCCBs, the RBI has found discrepancies in the records such as difference between their actual stock and the records. 
We have moved the Supreme Court, seeking direction to the RBI to accept scrapped notes.
