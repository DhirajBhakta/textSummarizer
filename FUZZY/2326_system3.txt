The incident occurred at Badshah Khan hospital in Faridabad on Friday afternoon after the hospital administration refused to facilitate an ambulance or private vehicle.The shocking incident is a repeat of August last year in Odisha's Kalahandi, where a tribal man carried the body of his wife on his shoulder for 10 km for last rites after the district hospital's refusal for an ambulance.In Faridabad, Laxmi, the nine-year-old girl, was suffering from high fever since Thursday night. 
We urged the civil hospital staff to provide ambulance so that we could at least carry the body, but they did not listen to us. 
Eventually, we decided to carry the body and walk till home," Hardev added.While he was carrying the body on his shoulder with other weeping family members tagging along, they were spotted by some media persons outside the hospital premises.
