? 
s most notorious chapters ? 
including Black Power, Head Hunters and Nomads ? 
will face off at a Whangarei community centre on Saturday night. 
It is the fourth choice of venue after three other options pulled out of the controversial event. 
Hoterene and his fellow organisers hope some of the lingering anger can be punched out in the boxing ring, but its been a challenge to get venues and some members of the community on board. ?
As soon as anybody hear?
s gang ? 
boom ? 
shuts down. 
We went through three venues till we actually found one ... we are looking at doing this properly, it has to be controlled because we want this to continue,? 
Hoterene told Maori Television.  ?
I?
We should be sticking together you know, brothers aye, that?
s what we?
re all about, sticking together,? 
he said.  ?
Things have changed. 
We?
re trying to make good all the P [methamphetamine] and all that sort of stuff and all the murders. 
We?
ve just had enough.?
Whangarei Police said in a statement they were aware of fight night and there would be an increased police presence in the area. 
Maori wardens will also be there.?
Police will conduct checks of those attending, and traveling to and from the event,?
