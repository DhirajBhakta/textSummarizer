Launched by the Thane Municipal Corporation two years ago, the app had become popular among residents. ?
The application started functioning two days ago. 
However, it is still in testing phase and we haven?
t formally launched it. 
The formal launch will take place next week. 
People who knew about the application use it. 
We have received one complaint till now,? 
The official said, ?
We had not renewed the contract of the agency which handled the application. 
We have signed an annual maintenance contract with the same agency.?
He said the contract was not renewed as the corporation plans to expand the application. ?
We want to include other complaints such as pipe burst, water leakage, uncollected garbage, unclean roads, water supply, open manholes, waterlogging, choked nullahs and poor conditions of the footpaths,?
