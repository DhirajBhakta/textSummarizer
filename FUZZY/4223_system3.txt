In a severe setback to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's fight against corruption in public places and his mission to promote Digital India, the portal of the country's anti-graft watchdog Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) has not been functioning for about four months now.Sources told India Today that the hard disk of CVC's portal crashed on November 28 and all data stored online till that data has been lost. 
After several communications, CVC director and Central Public Information Officer (CPIO) Jyoti Trivedi replied on December 22, 2016, saying that "due to technical problem in the working of complaint portal of the Commission, it is not possible to provide the action taken on your complaint at this stage".She added that the appellate authority in the matter was CVC additional secretary Praveen Sinha.Kosia petitioned Sinha, saying that the CPIO's response was not legally valid as per RTI Act 2005.
