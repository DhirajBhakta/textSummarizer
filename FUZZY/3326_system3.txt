Turns out the relationship rumours were pure fabrications created by her producers.For example, it had become common knowledge that Madhuri Dixit was in a relationship with Sanjay Dutt. 
It was business strategy, he writes.He adds that Madhuri Dixit was mostly linked with Sanjay Dutt because at one point, she was doing multiple films back to back with Sanju baba and most of them had become hits.Between 1987 and 1993, Madhuri Dixit had indeed starred with Sanjay Dutt in nine films! 
These are Zameen (1987), Khatron Ke Khiladi (1988), Kanoon Apna Apna (1989), Ilaaka (1989), Thanedaar (1990), Saajan (1991), Khalnayak (1993), Sahibaan (1993) and Jai Devaa (1993).
