And now fans are gearing up for another big clash. 
This time Akshay Kumar's Toilet Ek Prem Katha will fight it out with Shah Rukh Khan's next with Imtiaz Ali at the box office. 
And this has raised expectations and tension. 
But Khiladi Kumar, who has been in the industry for over two decades now, is unfazed by the clash. 
In an interview to BollywoodLife.com, Akshay said, "Tell me a guy who doesn't have a clash? 
Clash is going to happen. 
Clash is bound to happen." 
Last year, Rustom clashed with Hrithik Roshan's Mohenjo Daro, and passed the test with flying colours. 
From a quirky title to an interesting storyline to a fantastic on-screen pairing, the film has already raised expectations.
