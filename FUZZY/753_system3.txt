A woman who was attempting to free her lover from his "estranged" wife discovered that the couple had created an elaborate plot to dupe her.The victim, who wanted to marry the man, was asked to pay Rs 6 lakh to the wife as a pre-condition to proceed. 
"In the meanwhile, Ajay continued to meet me and maintain physical relations on the promise of marriage," she said.Things got ugly after she told the couple that she had run out of money and would need more time to arrange the cash. 
"I asked Ajay to come to meet my family and decide the date for marriage and in the meantime I would arrange the money," the woman said.
