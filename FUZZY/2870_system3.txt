By Lalit K Jha??????????? ?????????????? Washington, Jun 24 (PTI) Asserting that the US ties with India and Pakistan were not a zero-sum game, the White House has said that the Trump administrations priorities and the nature of relationship with the two countries were different. 
"We are also interested in continuing our cooperation with Pakistan," the official said adding that the US is concerned about tensions between India and Pakistan. 
"We see this as the US and India have mutual security interests that they want to advance, and we believe that the defence sales that are being discussed will help advance those. 
They may be different systems than we are transferring to Pakistan, but we dont believe they represent a threat to Pakistan," said the White House official. 
So I think this is an area where I think they can expand that dialogue on what they can do to help the economy, help Afghanistan become more self-sufficiently financially.
