If a picture is worth a thousand words, this one tells much more than that.A photograph of a group of primary school students studying in a toilet instead of a classroom in Neemuch district belies the tall claims of the Madhya Pradesh government about its efforts to improve education in the state. 
Shockingly, the local MLA is not even aware that such a school exists in his constituency, though the officials of the state education department acknowledge the appalling situation. 
However, the district education office K C Sharma said that he had written to the state education department about the situation and had sent proposal for construction of a school building.
