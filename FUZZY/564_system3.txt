It wasn?

						The 59-year-old actor also refuted reports that he objected to Sunny Leone?
s item number in Bhaiyyaji Superhitt due to alleged family objections. ?
People keep saying anything. 
Who am I to say no. 
I never interfere in my films. 
I prefer to remain silent,? 
he said.Sunny was speaking at the trailer launch of his next, Poster Boy. 
The film, directed by Shreyas Talpade, is a remake of the Marathi film Poshter Boyz. 
Bobby Deol, Shreyas and Dharmendra were also present at the launch.Asked about choosing Sunny to play one of the character, Shreyas told media on Monday: ?
I wanted Sunny sir to play the role because it adds credibility to the film. 
It?
s a little sensitive subject, and Sunny being a part of the film adds the credibility that it isn?
t an unpleasant or cheap film and it?
s a family entertainer.?
Shreyas said the new film is not completely different from the original but there are certain changes. ?
There were not major changes. 
That script itself was very powerful so we tried to retain that as much possible. 
We just did little bit tweaking, and tried to do away with some mistakes which we may have done in the original. 
We have tried to make it even better,?

						Bobby, who is playing one of the lead characters, spoke about the dialect he had to use for the film.He said: ?
It was a big challenge to speak in pure Hindi. 
Shreyas and I did a lot of workshops together. 
It was amazing how Shreyas knew everyone?
s dialogues. 
I wanted him to say my dialogues too. 
It was a difficult task, but also it was a lot of fun and exciting.?
The film, which stars Sunny, Bobby Deol and Shreyas, also features a voice-over by Ajay Devgn. 
Shreyas said the Shivaay actor came on board instantly. ?
We wanted the voice-over in the beginning to be impactful. 
He is a very dear friend, very supportive. 
He is what you call a very secure actor. 
I just showed him the trailer and asked if he would do the voice-over and he readily obliged. 
I can?
t thank him enough,? 
Shreyas said.?
I had heard that the Marathi film was a big hit. 
But after watching this trailer, I can say that this will be a bigger hit than the original. 
Shreyas should start working on a sequel,?
