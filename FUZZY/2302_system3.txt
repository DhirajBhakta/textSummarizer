A Twitter user on Saturday tweeted to United Hub about putting her dog on the wrong flight and asked for an explanation.You guys r idiots @united HOW U PUT MY DOG ON THE WRONG FLIGHT???? 
I need answersWhile there was no official reply from the United Hub given that the tweet could very well be a joke, other twitter users jumped in and offered assistance by recruiting their own 'pets' on different fronts.
