In an interview to Filmfare, Shraddha said, "I'm happy being single and focussing on my work. 
Shraddha might not be looking for a boyfriend right now, but she believes that love can happen any time. 
"Earlier, I was like, my man should have a good sense of humour, a sense of adventure. 
But now I realise that love can happen with anyone, any time, anywhere. 
Shraddha's love life has made headlines in the recent past and the actor revealed the rumours of her dating Farhan have affected her in a certain way, but now she has learnt to ignore them. 
But now I have learnt to ignore it," she added. 
On the work front, she will be seen romancing Arjun Kapoor in Half Girlfriend.
