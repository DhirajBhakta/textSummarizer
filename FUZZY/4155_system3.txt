44 cr as Bollywood's highest advance tax payer.
Actor Salman Khan once again proved to be the Sultan of Bollywood by paying the highest advance tax after beating Akshay Kumar and Hrithik Roshan in the financial year 2016-17. 
But the one who has surprised the Income Tax (IT) department is comedian-actor Kapil Sharma, whose income has shot up by almost 206 per cent in just one year.Indiatoday.in has an exclusive data of advance tax paid by top ten actors till March 15, 2017 which clearly shows that Salman Khan is the highest paid actor in the Indian film industry. 
However the department declined to give the advance tax numbers of Shah Rukh Khan, Amitabh Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, as all three of them are under investigation linked to Panama Papers leak case.
