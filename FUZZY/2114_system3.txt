England will not look to play for a draw on the final day of the fourth Test against India but would rather try to score quickly to set the hosts a target and keep alive the series, fast bowler James Anderson said on Sunday.The touring side, down 2-0 in the five-match series, trail India by 49 runs with four second-innings wickets remaining at the close of the fourth day.On a turning Wankhede Stadium pitch, batting fourth will not be easy for the hosts, who made 631 in their first innings.
