Karantaka's politicians can't seem to keen off the headlines, especially for all the wrong reasons. 
A case of obscene messages circulated by a member of the legislative council from Belgavi has surfaced.The WhatsApp groups of the media in Belegavi were in for a shock when they suddenly found a PDF file in their inboxes with 56 photos of porn stars.The photographs were sent by MLC Mahantesh Kavatagimath. 
The pictures and the message went viral and as soon as the MLC realised that he was in the dock, he switched off his phone and remained untraceable.Later, he is said to have apologised to the Belagavi media saying he had sent it by mistake.But this incident is a reminder of the number of times Karnataka has been caught in porn controversies and how the politicians of the state have been involved in them.
