Sehwag knows the India captain in and out and now has some interesting tales to tell about Kohli.Until Kohli became the captain of the Indian Test team, he was infamous for his brash and aggressive attitude and had quite a few run-ins with opposition players on the field. 
He was a shy and quite youngster in front of us senior players but when he was in the U-19 team he used to be very very naughty. 
He played the next match and smashed a double hundred," Sehwag told Star Sports in an interview.Sehwag also recalled the time he heard about Kohli for the first time and what he thought of the future India captain the first time he saw him bat live.
