wife Sunanda Pushkar was found dead. 
Replying to a court order, police said that despite two visits by Central Forensic Science Laboratory (CFSL) experts and five different reports from medical boards, they are yet to find out how she was murdered. 
The police said they will need more time to inspect the room, thereby delaying the case. 
In a plea, the hotel had earlier told court that closing the room for the last three years had caused them losses. 
But, since a year, no investigating agency has visited the suite and therefore the it is not required to be kept sealed any longer,? 
The board did not specify the type of poison and asked police to send the samples to a lab outside India.
