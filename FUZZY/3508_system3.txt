New Delhi, May 2 (PTI) Tata Teleservices has fired between 500 and 600 employees to tide over difficult times in the hyper-competitive telecom market. 
The lay-offs are across locations, they said, adding that the severance package being offered to the employees impacted by the decision is one months salary for every year of service. 
Sources in the company said that these are challenging times for the telecom industry. 
"What most of the operators including Tata Telservices are doing is workforce rationalisation, to stay competitive in line with the needs of the market," they added. 
The lay-offs comes at a time when the telecom industry has been witnessing an intense tariff war triggered by the entry of Reliance Jio, whose disruptive positioning in the market has left most of the telcos bleeding.
