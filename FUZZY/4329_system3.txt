However, RGV was quick to respond saying that such attacks are only hypocritical.The negative noise towards my tweet on @SunnyLeone arises from ultimate hypocrisy.She has more honesty and more self respect than any womanI appreciate ur honesty in accepting @SunnyLeone gets more attention than all the other women combined ???? 
https://t.co/RTUxux1RbmAfter this, RGV spoke about making a short film that would expose the "sanctimoniousness of extremely antithetical multifarious perspectives on the phenomenon of Sunny Leone."
Soon making short film on exposing sanctimoniousness of extremely antithetical multifarious perspectives on the phenomenon of @SunnyLeoneMy short film on her phenomenon will bare the veiled centrally decomposed cogitations in all the mentally corroded naysayers of @SunnyLeoneAll u illiterates who dint understand my earlier 2 tweets on @SunnyLeone atleast go through dictionary unless u are uneducated for that tooAway from the hungama on Twitter, Ram Gopal Varma will soon have to flex his directorial muscles on the big screen with Sarkar 3.
