 Having secured a Union government clearance to handover forest land for the proposed Navi Mumbai airport after much delay, the state government has formally set aside 250 hectares of forest land in Raigad district to the City and Industrial Development Corporation (Cidco) for the project.A delay in getting the forest land had held up crucial pre-development works for the Rs16,000-crore Navi Mumbai airport project. 
The government has already vetted the project in detail and it is established that it is a site-specific project and there is no alternative non-forest land available for it, so we have processed the transfer of land provided CIDCO adheres to the conditions put down by the Union government.?
The airport is proposed to be built on 1,160 hectares of land, of which 250 hectares is forest land, including mangroves.
