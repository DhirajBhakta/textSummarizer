RJD leader, Sanoj Yadav who was allegedly beaten by RJD supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav's elder son and health minister Tej Pratap Yadav has declared that he will be joining BJP soon. 
Yadav, incidentally could not properly defend Lalu on the debate, which infuriated Tej Pratap. 
An angry Tej Pratap, when saw Sanoj Yadav at Lalu's Iftaar, he not only misbehaved with him but also beat him up."
It's shocking that when Tej Pratap was abusing and thrashing me, Lalu was sitting a mute spectator like a "Dhritrashtra". 
Perhaps he was also scared of his son and did not intervene", said the former RJD leader.Soon after the incident, Sanoj Yadav resigned from all the post of the RJD and said that he was also fearing for his life from Tej Pratap Yadav. 
He said that, following the incident, BJP leader Sushil Modi contacted him and asked him to come and meet him at his Junta Durbar today. 
After meeting Modi on Tuesday, Yadav declared that he was soon going to join BJP.
