From Aditi Khanna London, Feb 16 (PTI)?Diners at a popular Indian restaurant in the city of Leicester were forced to abandon their meals mid-way after health inspectors discovered a cockroach infestation. 
"A resident of the district made us aware that a pest control company had been visiting Sands. 
"The business is now formally closed as a food business until our environmental health team are satisfied that the health risk condition no longer exists. 
We are working closely with representatives of the business and their pest control company to advise them about the steps they need to take in order for this to be achieved," she added. 
The restaurant will have to seek the approval of health inspectors to re-open once necessary refurbishment is completed.
