Petersburg. 
The famous journalist is facing severe flak from netizens for asking PM Modi whether he was on Twitter. 
Kelly launched her new show with an interaction featuring Russian President Vladimir Putin and PM Modi at Konstantin Palace in St. 
Petersburg. 
However, she soon found herself being slammed on social media for her absurd question to PM Modi while greeting him.
