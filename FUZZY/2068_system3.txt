First India, then Venezuela and now Australia is considering the proposal to demonetise its 100 dollar currency note as the country attempts to target tax evaders.While the Narendra Modi-led government has already started its fight against black money in the country, the Australian government is setting up a task force to curb black money and will appoint representatives during its mid-year budget meeting. 
UBS had recently batted for removal of the highest-denomination currency in Australia, and said the country can follow India's example. 
?"We believe removing large-denomination notes in Australia would be good for the economy and good for the banks," UBS had said. 
According to some estimates, there are about 300 million 100-dollar bills in the market and about 92 percent of the currency in circulation are in 50- and 100-dollar notes. 
Venezuela President Nicolas Maduro said the step will help fight smuggling mafias.
