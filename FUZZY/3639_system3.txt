Actor Aamir Khan, who is known to give award functions a miss for the past 15 years (he last attended the Oscars where his production Lagaan was nominated in the Foreign Film category), made an exception on Monday evening when he was honoured at the 75th Master Deenanath Mangeshkar Award. 
Apart from Aamir, Kapil Dev was honoured for his outstanding contribution to Indian cricket and yesteryear actress Vyjayanthimala Bali, was conferred with the Master Deenanath Vishesh Puraskar for her achievements in Indian cinema. 
The Master Deenananth Mangeshkar Awards are held in memory of Lata Mangeshkar's father - a well-known Marathi theatre actor, a renowned Natya Sangeet musician and a Hindustani classical vocalist.
