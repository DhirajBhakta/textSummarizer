New Delhi, Jul 12 (PTI) The BJP today hit out at Rahul Gandhi for attacking Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and "not terrorism", after his return from "vacation", hours after the Congress vice president said Modis policies had created space for terrorists in Kashmir. 
I want to ask when Mani Shankar Aiyar (Congress leader) sought Pakistans help in removing Modi from power and bring in the Congress, was it Rahuls personal agenda or political agenda?" 
When the Army chief was called a "goonda", she said referring to remarks of Congress leader Sandeep Dikshit, was it Rahuls personal agenda or political? 
BJP spokesperson Meenakshi Lekhi, at a press conference, asked the Congress vice president to read the history of his family, saying that they were responsible for problems in Kashmir.
