(Eds: Updating with more quotes) By Barun Jha Hamburg, Jul 8 (PTI) Prime Minister Narendra Modi today pressed upon his British counterpart Theresa May to ensure UKs cooperation to bring back economic offenders, amidst India working hard for the return of fugitive liquor baron Vijay Mallya and former IPL chief Lalit Modi. 
Modi today met May during a bilateral meeting on the sidelines of the G20 Summit here and sought UKs help in this regard. 
To a query on whether was Mallya in focus in terms of escaped economic offenders discussed with May, Baglay said, "We have put out a tweet and the term used there is a plural... its English language and people who know English should understand it".
