s ill-preparedness this monsoon, hit back in a rather cheeky way on Thursday. 
Malishka tweeted she is ready with six more songs. 
She further wrote, ?
I am a rapper now. 
Also a breeder apparently.? 
The ?
breeder? 
comment referred to the BMC sending a notice to the RJ?
s mother on Wednesday for ?
breeding dengue? 
at the Bandra flat, days after Malishka?
s video went viral. 
The video, ?
(Mumbai, don?
t you trust BMC?) 
went viral on social media inviting the BMC and Sena?
s ire. 
Malishka thanked Mumbaiites on Twitter for their support. 
She also received support from activists like Shailesh Gandhi. 
He tweeted, ?
Support Malishka against BMC harassment for singing the truth. 
Upload your own videos.? 
Another activist from Bandra, Dolphy D?
Souza, said there should be no punitive action against Malishka. 
He said, ?
Instead of taking corrective measures, the BMC is shooting the messenger.? 
Damania tweeted, ?
Malishka every word you said comes from Mumbaikar?
s heart. 
Thanks for having the spine to stand against Shiv Sena and BJP.? 
BMC officials, however, continued to say the notice was a part of a routine exercise. ?
How will we know it was Malishka?
s residence??
said a civic official. 
The song ?
Sonu, tula RJ var bharavsa nahi ka?? 
is similar to Malishka?
s video released last week.
