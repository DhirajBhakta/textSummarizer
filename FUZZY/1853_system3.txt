However, none of the colleges have managed to get the highest grade in quality assessment conducted by a UGC appointed panel. 
The quality status score is given by the National Accredition and Assessment Council (NAAC), an autonomous body of University Grants Commission (UGC). 
Shri Ram College of Commerce (SRCC), Lady Shri Ram College for Women (LSR) and Hindu College have scored 3.65, 3.61 and 3.60 points, respectively.  
To get A++ an institution has to score a grade between 3.76 to 4. ?
There are certain parameters like research, consultancy and extension on which colleges are marked. 
But if we see research is not factored in our workload and over consultancy there is a veil of secrecy. 
So for colleges and universities there can?
t be judged on the same set of parameters,? 
said a teacher at LSR on condition of anonymity.However the college whose score has taken everyone by surprise is St.Stephen?
s.  
The A grade also has Sukhdev College of Business Studies, Sri Venkateswara College and Zakir Hussain College. 
Parameters on which NAAC scores are based Curricular Aspects  Teaching-Learning and Evaluation Research, Consultancy and Extension?
Infrastructure and Learning Resources?
Student Support and Progression?
Governance, Leadership and Management?
Innovations and Best PracticesThese scores are valid for five years after which the colleges will again have to apply for accreditation. 
It was in 2012 that UGC made accreditation compulsory for higher educational institutions and DU executive council adopted the decision in 2014. 
It is a very systematic process which is comprehensive and some of which is even video recorded,? 
said a teacher at SRCC. 
While the grades are out, their impact remains unclear.  ?
This is something we are not very sure about. 
By what we have heard, this score would determine the grant given by the government to the institutions,? 
said a teacher at St. 
Stephen?
s College.
