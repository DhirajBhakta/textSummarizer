Mohabbatein girl Kim Sharma disappeared from the spotlight when she married business tycoon Ali Punjani in 2010 and moved to Kenya. 
Recently, her return to Mumbai sparked rumours of trouble in paradise. 
The irony is that when Ali met Kim, he was plump and not great-looking but now because he is in love, he has lost weight and looking great. 
But Kim is left with no money or financial security. 
Right now, she is looking to establish her business in Mumbai to provide for herself financially. 
She is now a brand strategist and goes by the name Kimi Sharma (her real name). 
Kimi didn't just leave their home in Kenya behind, but her job as the CEO of Punjani's chain of hotels as well."
Interestingly, ever since her return, Kim has been linked to menswear designer Arjun Khanna and has even been clicked with him on several occasions. 
Reportedly, Arjun's growing proximity to Kim is the reason why his marriage with wife Shefalee is on the rocks.
