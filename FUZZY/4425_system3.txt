Tokyo, Feb 27 (PTI) Scientists have created a highly flexible material that is tougher than steel, by combining hydrogels with woven glass fibre fabric, which may have a wide range of potential applications. 
Though such a substance has potential as a structural biomaterial, up until now no material reliable and strong enough for long-term use has been produced. 
The procedure to make the material is simply to immerse the fabric in PA precursor solutions for polymerisation. 
The team theorises that toughness is increased by dynamic ionic bonds between the fibre and hydrogels, and within the hydrogels, as the fibres toughness increases in relation to that of the hydrogels.
