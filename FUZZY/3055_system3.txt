After beating Kamlabai, her husband and sons, the cops arrested her grandsons along with Kamlabai herself. 
Bandaged on arms and legs where she has suffered fractures, Kamlabai went to meet the Madhya Pradesh CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan who was fasting 40km from her village in Dusshera Maidan in Bhopal. 
But to her dismay, she was not allowed to meet the chief minister who was holding his 'peace fast' for the state farmers. 
The couple has gone on a fast now, demanding that the chief minister meet them and assure them justice for the unprovoked assault they were subjected to and punish the policemen.
