Thiruvananthapuram, Dec 12 (PTI) Congress MP and former Union minister Shashi Tharoor today took exception to continued disruption of Parliament and said those disrupting the House should be suspended automatically. 
The Congress leader also hit out at BJP and said the party had disrupted the House, when it was in opposition and had now become "high advocates of Parliament proceedings." 
To a question on the Manmohan Singh-led UPA governments alleged involvement in the AgustaWestland scam, Tharoor said nobody would believe that former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh would commit a mistake. 
I do not think that he will do any financial mistake," he said.
