The actor said that growing up, her family was poor and she could not afford a car to go to school. 
Kkanoo Gupta took to Facebook to slam Parineeti for "lying through the teeth" about her impoverished background."
Shame...coming from a privileged background and lying through the teeth in front of camera. 
Create a fabricated sob story of no money no car etc etc (sic)," he wrote.He added, "Coming from the same school I probably also remember the car her father used to have. 
My friends from CJM (Convent of Jesus and Mary) would probably understand the lies a bit better (sic)."
Comments on the post seem to agree that Parineeti came from an influential family in Ambala and even cited her education at the University of Manchester as an example.
