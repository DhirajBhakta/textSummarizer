By Abhishek Anshu New Delhi, Jun 18 (PTI) Unsuccessful love stories have found a very vivid description in a Supreme Court observation wherein it has said that women sacrificing their relationship to accept parents decision is a common phenomenon in India. 
The top court noted that the woman might have first "unwillingly" agreed to go by her parents wish but later she apparently changed her mind which appeared from the scene of the incident where garlands, bangles and vermilion were found. 
The man had told the trial court that since her family was not agreeing to their marriage, both of them had decided to commit suicide and consumed copper sulphate at a house in an under-construction building in Jaipur. 
"When she was madly in love with the appellant (man) and wanted to marry him, there is a possibility that after receiving such kind of shabbily treatment at the hands of her parents, in anguish she may have decided to revolt and, therefore, proposed to the appellant that they should get married for which they chose a secluded place," the bench noted in its order.
