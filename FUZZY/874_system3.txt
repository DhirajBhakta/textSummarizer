About 210 websites of the central and state government departments were found to be displaying personal details and Aadhaar numbers of beneficiaries, Parliament was informed on Wednesday.?
UIDAI (The Unique Identification Authority of India) has taken note of the same and is regularly monitoring the status to get the Aadhaar data removed from the said websites,? 
Minister of State for Electronics and IT, PP Chaudhary said in a written reply in Lok Sabha.The monitoring came after ?
As on July 13, 2017, 123 schemes of various Central Ministries/Departments have been notified under Section 7 or 57 of Aadhaar Act, 2016. 
In respect of these schemes, Aadhaar number is necessary for the purpose of establishing identity of an individual to enable receipt of subsidies, benefits and services etc,? 
he added.To another query, he said that the linkage of Aadhaar number with PAN (Permanent Account Number) database will allow a ?
robust way? 
of de-duplication as the former is based on biometric attributes of finger prints and iris images.?
he said.Seeding of Aadhaar will allow weeding out any undetected duplicate PANs, he added.PAN is the key identifier of taxable entity and aggregator of all financial transactions undertaken by the entity.
