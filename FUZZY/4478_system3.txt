The All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE), which regulates technical education in the country, has asked all the institutions, affiliated to it, "to urgently put in place an online mechanism, if not presently existing, for registering and disposing of grievances". 
"Every institution should be able to receive and dispose off the grievances online," said the missive, signed by AICTE chief Anil Sahasrabudhe and addressed to the heads of all the AICTE-approved technical institutions. 
As per directive, each of these institutions will have to put up a notice board or flex board fixed near the office of the Head, giving details of the online grievance redressal mechanism like its URL, names, contact numbers and e-mail addresses of members of the Grievance committee etc.
