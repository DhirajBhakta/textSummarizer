Shane Warne, one of Alastair Cook's harshest critics over the years, praised the former England captain saying that he is a very respectful guy with a lot of class.
The Three Lions lost all wickets in a single session to lose the second Test match by 108 runs, allowing Bangladesh to level the series 1-1. 
"He's respected and I think he's gone about it with a lot of class. 
He went through some really tough times a few years ago when a lot of us, me included, thought he wasn't suited to the job. 
I think he's done a wonderful job for England and I wish him all the best."
