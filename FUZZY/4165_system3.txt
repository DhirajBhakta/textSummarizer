Just because everyone may not agree with me, doesn't mean I'll stop putting forth what I want to say. 
While B-Towners from Shah Rukh Khan to Aamir Khan had expressed their concern that India was becoming increasingly intolerant, Anupam Kher had begged to differ.

They need to be implemented. 
The film also stars Taapsee Pannu, Akshay Kumar and Manoj Bajpayee.
