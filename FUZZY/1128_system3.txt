Here is our Running Shaadi movie review.Running Shaadi Cast: Amit Sadh, Taapsee Pannu, Arsh BajwaRunning Shaadi Direction: Amit RoyRunning Shaadi Rating: (3/5)Running Shaadi, previously known as Runningshaadi.com but not anymore because Shaadi.com approached Bombay High Court protesting against the title, is a film that is great in patches but is mostly just about okay.The story of Running Shaadi involves Ram Bharose (Amit Sadh) and Nimmi (Taapsee Pannu), a boy and girl who grow up together in Punjab and after a fallout with his boss, Ram joins hands with his friend 'Cyberjeet' (the excellent Arsh Bajwa) to start a website called Runningshaadi.com that organises all that an everyday eloping couple from India would need.
