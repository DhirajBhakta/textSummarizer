Mumbai, Mar 29 (PTI) Reversing its earlier order, the Reserve Bank today said the bank branches dealing in government businesses need not remain open on April 1 in view of the annual closing business. 
In its earlier directive on March 24, the RBI had asked all authorised banks to be open on all days from March 25 to April 1, including Saturday, Sunday and all holidays, to facilitate the governments receipts and payments. 
In its revised instructions issued today, RBI said, "On reconsideration, it has been decided that these branches need not be opened on April 1, 2017." 
In a letter to the Indian Banks Association, unions AIBEA and AIBOA today said the RBI issued the directive "very late, causing huge resentment" among bank employees.
