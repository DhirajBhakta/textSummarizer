The report suggests that Karan Johar has roped in Shashank Khaitan as the director of the film. 
Earlier Sara Ali Khan was in running for this film before she opted out for Kedarnath. 
In fact, the two have begun with the look tests for the remake. 
In real life, Jhanvi and Ishaan are rumoured to be dating each other. 
Their appearance at the screening of Badrinath Ki Dulhania in March this year grabbed eyeballs. 
And this very movie date gave way to link-up rumours. 
And a recent report in Mid-Day only confirmed the news when Ishaan was warned by his brother to focus on his career. 
The report suggests that Ishaan and Jhanvi are secretly dating, and Shahid doesn't want Ishaan's personal life to take away the focus from his debut film Beyond The Clouds. 
While Jhanvi will make her big screen debut with The Fault In The Stars Remake, Ishaan has already begun shooting for Majid Majidi's Beyond The Clouds.?
