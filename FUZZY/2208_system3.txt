40th over: England 122-5 (Stokes 17, Ali 27) We have a quick run our review as Moeen sweeps for two...
However, I would like to see Buttler given another go in Tests, and think the true tracks in Australia will suit him. 
29th over: England 83-4 (Bairstow 16, Stokes 5) Morkel takes the ball and rams one into Bairstow?
Bairstow uses his feet to take a single into the off side, which means three balls into the rough at Stokes - close by are two silly points. 
That bouncer was part of a plan he communicated to Morris last over, though the bowler did well to hold it back initially, then bowl it as quickly as he did. 
24th over: England 72-3 (Cook 42, Bairstow 10) Bairstow twists one away against the spin, and it zooms for four through square-leg. 
17th over: England 50-2 (Cook 31, Root 7) Cook has never scored more than 50 at Trent Bridge; you?
says Mikey, far more melodically than I can type. root takes a single off the final ball of the over, playing it down into the off side and haring away. ?
I prefer Rashid to Dawson too, but do find it telling that Root, who knows him well, wold rather do without. 
Philander has bowled 6.3 overs, of which 33 deliveries have landed in line with the stumps; he now has the best average of any bowler with 50 or more Test wickets.
