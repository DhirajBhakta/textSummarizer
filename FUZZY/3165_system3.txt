Sources in the Army told India Today that the firing was done in retaliation to Pakistan's constant violation of ceasefire along the Line of Control. 
INDIA'S DEPUTY HIGH COMMISSIONER SUMMONED? Meanwhile, Pakistan summoned India's Deputy High Commissioner JP Singh in Islamabad following Army's killing. 
Pakistan alleges that at least one civilian was killed and four others were injured in the Indian firing in Battal sector this morning. 
Senior Pakistan official Dr Mohammad Faisal, who is a Director General (SA & SAARC), said, "The deliberate targeting of civilians is indeed condemnable and contrary to human dignity and international human rights and humanitarian laws."
Commenting on the ceasefire violation, Defence Military spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Manish Mehta said, "The Pakistan Army initiated indiscriminate firing and shelling on our positions on the LoC in Rajouri district's Naushera sector and Krishna Ghati sector in Poonch. 
They are using small arms, automatics and mortars."
