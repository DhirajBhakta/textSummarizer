?"I have resigned from the Congress with a very heavy heart. 
?"From top to bottom, there is intra-party politicking in the Congress. 
The party never took a clear position on the aspirations of the Patidars," she said. 
"I have joined Narendra Modi's journey of development," she added.
?Similarly, PI Patel also said, "The Congress has done injustice to the Patels." 
Balwantsinh Rajput echoed Tejashree Patel and said, "Modi is Vikas Purush."
