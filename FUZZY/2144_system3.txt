New Delhi, Dec 7 (PTI) Consumer sales have seen a 25-30 per cent hit in past few weeks due to twin impact of demonetisation and seasonal slowdown post Diwali, countrys third largest handset maker Micromax said today. 
While online sales suffered due to cash crunch in the aftermath of demonetisation, the companys supply chain saw a 15-18 per cent decline in sales in the last few weeks. 
But overall, we are trending at 25-30 per cent decline in these 3-4 weeks and we think its a bit lower than industry," Micromax Chief Marketing Officer Shubhajit Sen said. 
According to various reports, the governments demonetisation drive and the cash crunch that followed has hit sales of mobile handsets, including those sold online.
