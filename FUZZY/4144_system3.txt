BJP MLA Brijesh Singh's posters thanking voters for the recent astounding victory have created a stir in the Saharanpur district of Uttar Pradesh after they named Deoband as Deovrind. 
While Deoband is known for its historical significance and Darul Uloom Deoband has been a centre of Islamic learning since the Mughal era, Brijesh Singh had demanded that the city be renamed Deovrind after BJP came into power. 
Deoband will always be known because of Darul Uloom," said Maulana Arshad Madani, president of Jamat Ulema-E-Hind.Due to the eminence of Darul Uloom, Deoband sees an influx of students who come here in pursuit of Islamic learning.
