Rishi Kapoor lashed out at director Anurag Basu after the lukewarm response to son Ranbir Kapoor?
In an interview with Mid-Day, Rishi Kapoor also slammed music composer Pritam.  ?
t show their films before release to take opinions, and treat it as though they?
I totally agree with Ekta (Kapoor) when she threw him out from her film. 
t released in some international markets on time, Rishi Kapoor again blamed Basu?
film also has to release at the right time, like during the school vacations. 
t want Govinda to work in your film, why did you ask him in the first place??
