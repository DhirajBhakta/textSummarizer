Buzz has it that Simran is allegedly inspired by the life of an NRI nurse in the US, Sandeep Kaur. 
Kaur was sent imprisoned last year for robbing banks to pay off her gambling debts. 
The film revolves around the story of a girl, her ambitions and how she gets addicted to the world of crime.Kangana will don various avatars in Mehta's film, and one of her look made its way to social media. 
Wearing a super-hero costume, the 30-year-old is goofing on the sets of Simran with her Gujarati diction coach Suraj Vyas. 
From making her watch some of the evergreen Gujarati films like Chello Divas, Amari Duniya Tamari Duniya and Mehendi Rang Lagyo to catching up on Gujarati plays, Mehta helped Kangana bring the character alive on screen.
