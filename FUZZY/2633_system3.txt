On the occasion of Guru Purnima today, the students fondly recalled the contribution of their mentor Ramakant Achrekar who they call Achrekar Sir. 
The octogenarian was felicitated today at a programme Guru Vandana organised by Deeplo Sports Club here in presence of his several students. 
"There was no off-season with sir as we played with rubber ball during Monsoon. 
He has created good coaches along good players. 
Former India stumper and batsman Chandrakant Pandit recalled how "visionary" Achrekar sir made him change his school to pursue a career in cricket. 
Another ex-stumper Sameer Dighe remembered the role played by the veteran trainer in his career. 
"Pravin (Amre) used to keep wickets. 
But on sirs word for me, he left keeping when I was playing for Mithibai (College)," recalled Dighe, the present Mumbai Ranji coach. 
"Till that time, I did not know that the ball was called an in-swing," Sandhu said sending a peal of laughter in audience. 
"It was sir who asked me to develop the in-swing," he added. 
Pandurang Salgoankar, who had played with Achrekar, narrated some instances, involving the latter as a wicket keeper. 
However, Sachin Tendulkar could not make it to the event as he was abroad.
