And Khiladi Kumar recently took everyone by surprise when he made a special appearance at the screening of ex-girlfriend Pooja Batra's Mirror Games. 
Clad in black track pants and a jacket, Akshay did not hesitate to pose for the shutterbugs along with Pooja. 
According to a report in Hindustan Times, Akshay made a fleeting appearance and did not stay to watch the film. 
A source was quoted as telling the daily, "Akshay's wife Twinkle was also supposed to join him and be at the screening, but since she had to travel, she could not make it there. 
Akshay dropped Twinkle at the airport and stopped by at the screening. 
He didn't watch the film but was there only for a couple of minutes."
On the work front, Akshay is currently shooting for Padman.
