Four terrorists were killed today by the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) and the Jammu and Kashmir Police, after they attempted to attack a CRPF camp at Sumbal in Bandipora district of Jammu and Kashmir. 
They lobbed grenades, and later opened fire. 
After a heavy exchange of fire, the other terrorists were forced to retreat, and were gunned down by Sumbal Police personnel, who had surrounded them. 
A large cache of arms and ammunitions - including 4 AK 47 rifles (one of which was fitted with UBGL), and over a dozen grenades - have been recovered. 
The "terrorists were planning to take control and burn down the camp. 
The plan of fidayeen was to get inside the camp and take control of a vantage point to prolong (the) encounter...then to burn up the place with incendiary material causing wide-scale damage," highly-placed sources said. 
CRPF IG Zulfikar Hassan commended his men for successfully fending off the terror attack. 
"Our alert jawans along with Jammu and Kashmir police neutralised the terrorists," he said. 
Incidentally, this was Chetan Cheeta 's battalion. 
Cheeta is the brave CRPF officer who took nine bullets in an encounter in Bandipora earlier this year. 
This comes close on the heels of a terror attack on an army convoy in Quazigund.
