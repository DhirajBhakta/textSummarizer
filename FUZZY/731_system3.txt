I learnt the Gujarati diction from my coach Dimple. 
We used to write down the words in the way it is pronounced and once you are familiar with those words it was easier to talk in that accent and style,? 
I knew him as Shah Rukh, the superstar, and I was going to do a romantic film with him. 
When I met him on the sets he congratulated me, he was chilled out, he made me feel comfortable. 
He was not intimidating,? 
the actress recalled.?
Later I realised that he was such a big support system for me in my first film, he made things easy for me as a newcomer without making it obvious. 
It was really nice of him,? 
she added.The 29-year-old said she treats newcomers in the similar way SRK treated her.
