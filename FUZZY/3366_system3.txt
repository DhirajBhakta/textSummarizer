Sex education has finally entered the hinterlands of Haryana as a think-tank from ministries of human resource development, women and child development and health is set to start educating students on sex, contraceptives and natural urge in the state's government schools under Centre's National Health Mission Rashtriya Kishor Swasthya Karyakram.The aim of classes on sex education in Haryana's Yamunanagar is to end the stigma around sex and prevent teenage pregnancy culture from picking momentum.The lessons will include treating sex as a natural desire and not an equivalent of a disorder. 
The focus will be on ensuring that sex is treated as a need without any disgust. 
"We cannot emphasise enough on how there is a dire need to abolish the stigma around sex," Dr Dharamveer Singh, assistant project coordinator and member of the committee told Mail Today.The lessons, to be delivered in the government schools and anganwadis, will highlight that indulging in sex entails social and health consequences. 
This will precisely solve the naive conundrums in a teenagers head, said Dharamveer."
It is currently targeting every block of Yamunanagar with a sole aim to make the teens understand that sex is acceptable but pregnancy before maturity is not," Dr Sunil Kumar, deputy civil surgeon and a member of the project from State Health Department said.
