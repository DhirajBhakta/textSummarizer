A new book "The Baba Ramdev Phenomenon: From Moksha to Market" by Kaushik Deka has these nuggets of information. 
It was a book primarily explaining the true tenets of Hinduism, making an appeal for one uniform religion based on the principles of the Vedas. 
I wanted to follow the path shown by the ancient sages," Ramdev is quoted as saying. 
So one fine day he fled from home and enrolled himself in a gurukul, a traditional educational institute based on Vedic principles, at Khanpur in Haryana," Deka writes. 
"The Baba Ramdev Phenomenon: From Moksha to Market", published by Rupa, offers a detailed account of Ramdevs journey from attaining moksha in the Himalayas to ruling the market, especially the FMCG sector, with his Patanjali products.
