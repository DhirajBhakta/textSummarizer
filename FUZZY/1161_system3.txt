Even before the row over the order asking cine-goers to stand up before a movie for the National Anthem died down, the Supreme Court Tuesday admitted a plea which said "equal respect and status" should be given to National Song Vande Mataram too. 
"Constituent Assembly of India was empowered by Jawaharlal Nehru in August 25, 1948 by making a statement to alter the words or choose entirely a new song but unfortunately it could not be done and on January 24, 1950 Jana Gana Mana and Vande Mataram both songs were adopted of equal honour with each other and equal status," said the petition filed by Supreme Court lawyer Sanjeev Bhatnagar.
