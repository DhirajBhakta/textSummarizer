The Aaj Tak Salaam Cricket 2017 brought together some of the most iconic names in the cricketing world and there were some expected fireworks right through the day, especially when the likes of Sourav Ganguly and Shane Warne came face-to-face with Michael Clarke watching on.Ganguly had, in 2001, tamed Australia in that historic series which the hosts won 2-1 after bouncing back from a defeat at the Wankhede Stadium. 
It was in the course of that iconic series that the then Indian captain Ganguly, had got to the Australians' nerves by delaying the toss.Sixteen years later, Shane Warne, who was an integral part of Steve Waugh's team, said he was okay with what Ganguly did in his home turf and thought it was a smart, aggressive move to derail the Aussies by coming out late for the toss.However, Ganguly, who was present along with Clarke for the session titled "Warnie, Pup and Dada" show, reiterated that Warne wasn't as accepting of the tactic back in 2001: "Everytime I came out to bat , he would pitch the ball outside leg and remind me to play the game in the right spirit."
