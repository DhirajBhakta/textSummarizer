From Sajjad Hussain Islamabad, Jan 5 (PTI) Claiming that Kashmir was an "integral part" of Pakistan, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif today needled India yet again by praising slain Hizbul Mujahideen militant Burhan Wani as a "vibrant and charismatic leader". 
He claimed the "martyrdom of vibrant and charismatic Kashmiri leader Burhan Wani has given a new turn to the Kashmiri movement". 
Sharif said Pakistan had sent special envoys to important countries to sensitise them about the situation in Kashmir. 
Referring to the four points he presented before the UN, Sharif once again urged the world community to make all out efforts for the realisation of the promise it made to the Kashmiri people seventy years ago.
