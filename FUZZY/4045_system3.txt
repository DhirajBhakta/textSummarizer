The actor was stalked by a male fan when she was in Delhi for a brand shoot recently, Mid-Day reports.Reportedly, the man reached Disha's hotel on two consecutive days to meet her. 
It does not end there. 
He relentlessly followed her, be it to her set, a shopping mall or a movie theatre. 
In fact, he even had a scuffle with the hotel staff because he was not allowed to meet her, and was promptly removed from the premises.Disha told the publication, "I am relieved that the episode is over. 
I am deeply overwhelmed by the love of fans. 
It was an unpleasant experience."
While the actor did not register a complaint, she has decided to have a bodyguard with her at all times as a safety measure.
