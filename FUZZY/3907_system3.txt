A woman fell 60 feet from one of the US tallest bridges while taking a selfie but miraculously survived after landing on a trail below. 
The Sacramento-area woman was expected to survive after she fell 60 feet off the restricted area of the Foresthill Bridge near Auburn, California, while trying to take a selfie, the Placer County Sheriffs Office said. 
Police in a California county put out a Facebook post after she fell, warning camera-toting thrill seekers that, "You can lose your life and none of that is worth a selfie!" 
"This young lady is very lucky to be alive and the consequences could have been worse for her, her friends and her family," the Placer County Sheriffs Office wrote on its Facebook page.
