On their way back, once Kovind has taken his oath, the two will exchange seats, leaving Mukherjee on the right and Kovind on the left.This buggy has interesting history at its tail. 
Here's where it comes from:WHERE DID THE BUGGY COME FROM?
The gold-plated, horse-drawn buggy originally belonged to the Viceroy of India during the British era. 
How it remained in India after Independence is a story that will make many happy.After the partition, both India and Pakistan wanted the fancy buggy, and there was no longer a higher power to sort this quarrel. 
So, what did they do to sort the dispute?
Simple. 
They did what cricket captains do these days. 
They tossed.Lt Col Thakur Govind Singh from India and Pakistan Army's Sahabzada Yaqub Khan let the responsibility of the buggy ownership rest on a coin.Guess who won the toss?
Of course, India did.
