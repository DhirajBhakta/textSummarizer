The boy, now 16, who was 15 at the time of the alleged attack and cannot be named for legal reasons, denies the manslaughter of Arkadiusz J??
[He] jumped up from the ground, using the whole force of his body to hit Mr J??
The defendant sat with his parents at the back of the courtroom, and the judge, Patricia Lynch, and barristers sat without their wigs and robes due to his age. 
The three men sat on a bench near a group of teenagers with bikes, including the defendant, who had been there for most of the day, Cottage said. 
For whatever reason, maybe even just immature bravado, the prosecution say [he] took a deliberate decision to use unlawful violence when he went around the back of the group to punch Mr J??
