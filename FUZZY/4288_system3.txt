New Delhi, Mar 10 (PTI) The government and the industry should share responsibility for creating an environment that fosters innovators and helps them take ideas to the market, eminent industrialist Ratan Tata said today. 
"I believe responsibility of private sector is as much to encourage these innovations because it is outside sphere of a normal banking arrangement to see innovation being funded and so I believe under the auspices of the President and the Department of Science and Technology (DST) are looking at very important moment in our history," Tata said. 
"It is great privilege and great honour to be here today as someone who is been in the start-up and the ... innovation sector and to be aware that today at the highest level in the country, we are receiving the kind of attention that we should have received many many years ago," Tata said at the concluding day of the Festival of Innovations.
