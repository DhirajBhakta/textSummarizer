Washington, Feb 27 (PTI) NASA plans to send its first robotic spacecraft to the Sun next year that is slated to get within six million kilometres of the blazing star to probe its atmosphere. 
Humans have sent spacecraft to the Moon, Mars and even distant interstellar space. 
"This is going to be our first mission to fly to the Sun," said Eric Christian, a NASA research scientist at Goddard Space Flight Centre. 
"We cant get to the very surface of the Sun," but the mission will get close enough to answer three important questions, Christian said. 
However, the atmosphere above it is a sizzling two million degrees Celsius. 
"You would think the farther away you get from a heat source, you would get colder. 
Why the atmosphere is hotter than the surface is a big puzzle," Christian said. 
The scientists also want to know how solar wind gets its speed, Live Science reported. 
"The Sun blows a stream of charged particles in all directions at a million miles an hour. 
But we do not understand how that gets accelerated," he said.
