Bubble, Mr Molt, Flipper, Donald, Daisy, Popeye and Olive, have stolen hearts. 
						The Humboldt penguin is a south American species found in the cold climate of coastal Peru and Chile. 
Bubble is the naughtiest and does not let the others eat before she does, and birthday boy Mr Molt, the youngest male, is the most playful of the lot, said zoo officials. 
Molt got his name because he was molting (shedding his skin, which regenerates on its own every year) when he was brought to the zoo. 
City-based activists, however, were irked when they got to know Mr Molt was made to wear a t-shirt. ?
