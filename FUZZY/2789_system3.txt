The Janta Dal United (JDU) has slammed Prime Minister Narendra Modi after he made an emotional pitch in Gujarat on Thursday asserting that killing in the name of cow protection was unacceptable. 
The JD-U, hitting out at the prime minister, said that there has been a spurt in incidents of lynching and killing in the name of "gau raksha" across the country because the BJP government made cow a national agenda for seeking and polarising votes.Speaking to India Today, JD-U spokesperson Neeraj Kumar said that PM Modi was more interested in votes in the name of cow rather than "gau seva"."
