Car connoisseurs in Delhi have been given a reason to rejoice by the National Green Tribunal, who on Friday made an exception to the ban on vehicles older than 15 years on Delhi roads and gave permission to the 21 Gun Salute Heritage and Cultural Trust to conduct their International Vintage Car Rally in February.?
We make it clear that none of the vintage cars would be otherwise permitted on the roads of NCR, Delhi, nor any authority would issue fitness certificates to them without specific order of the tribunal,? 
said the plea, filed through advocate P V Raghunandan.In July last year, the NGT had ordered the Delhi government to de-register diesel vehicles that were 10 years old or more, but had asked them to start with automobiles older than 15 years in the first phase, in an attempt to combat the rising air pollution.Read: Mohalla Clinics: Kofi Annan praise fine, but will Delhi govt fix these 4 issues?
