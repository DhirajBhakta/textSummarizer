Not enough attention. 
Not enough credit. 
This is what several playback singers in present-day Bollywood feel is on their plate. 
However, Lata Mangeshkar, the ?
Nightingale of India? 
and Bharat Ratna awardee, says that in her days as a young artiste ? 
this was when the term ?
Bollywood?
, a derivative of Hollywood, didn?
t even exist ? 
she never saw the need or the opportunity for media attention.Read: Bollywood doesn?
t give us due credit: Playback singers voice their discontent?
When I began singing, I didn?
t even know about the media, or how to get written about. 
Mujhe toh sirf gana tha (all I had to do was sing). 
After my father?
s untimely death, I was the sole bread-winner of the family. 
I had no time to think of anything except how to look after my siblings. 
The only thing I could do was sing. 
So I sang. 
I?
d leave early in the morning and commute by train(in Mumbai) from studio to studio, meeting music directors hoping to get work,? 
The majority of them, from films like Mehboob?
s Andaz and Raj Kapoor?
s Barsaat, were big hits. 
In 1949, I had 40-50 chartbusters, including Hawaa mein udta jaye, Jiya beqaraar hai (Barsaat); Aayega aanewala (Mahal); Lara lapaa (Ek Thi Ladki); Chup chup khade ho (Badi Bahen); and Sajan ki galiyan chhod chale (Lahore).?
She recalls her relationship with female leads with much fondness: ?
During those days, playback singers were called ?
ghost voices?
, because we really were like ghosts... totally invisible to the public. 
Kamini?
, which was [actor] Madhubala?
s name in the film.?
Apparently, all the major heroines of those times, from Madhubala and Meena Kumari to Nutan and Hema Malini, insisted on only Lataji?
s voice for their playback. 
What you have heard is true. 
I sang my songs keeping the heroine?
s personality in mind. 
There was no desire to be heard beyond the screen. 
In fact, for many years, I desisted from doing live concerts.?
