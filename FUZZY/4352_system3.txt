New Delhi, Mar 6 (PTI) Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal today said Delhi will be made as clean as London keeping its unique cultural ethos intact, seeking to clarify his earlier remarks which have been mocked by the Opposition. 
Kejriwal said that his Aam Aadmi Party would clean up the capital within one year of coming to power in the three municipal corporations of Delhi (MCDs). 
While addressing a gathering yesterday, Kejriwal had said that if the AAP won the MCD polls, it would spruce up Delhi and make it look like London within a year. 
"It is only the AAP which can clean up Delhi as people know that we have done unprecedented works in education, water, power and health," the Delhi chief minister said.
