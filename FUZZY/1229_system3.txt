In a potboiler of a twist to the ongoing Tamil Nadu drama, it is learnt that superstar Rajinikanth may soon launch his own political party.Sources have told India Today TV the 66-year-old star has been advised by senior RSS ideologue S Gurumurthy to float his own outfit.Sources said Gurumurthy's proposal is part of a BJP plan to enter the state riding on the massive popularity and cult status enjoyed by Rajinikanth in Tamil Nadu.The BJP plans to fish in the troubled waters of Tamil Nadu by projecting Rajinikanth as the chief ministerial face.
