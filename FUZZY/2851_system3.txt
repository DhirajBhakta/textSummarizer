Batting coach Sanjay Bangar says Anil Kumble's departure as head coach has definitely left a void in the Indian cricket team set-up even though the players are "coping up" well.Kumble, a spinner par excellence and a former India captain, tendered his resignation as chief coach after the ICC Champions Trophy due to "untenable" differences with skipper Virat Kohli.On the eve of the second ODI against the West Indies here, questions related to the Kumble episode were directed at Bangar."
We are professionals and such things are part and parcel of any organisation where changes happen. 
Everyone's contributed towards it and as I said earlier, when you part ways it's never easy. 
You need to accept that at times such things are going to happen, have happened in the past. 
But what is of paramount importance is that Indian cricket should keep moving forward and the performances of the team shouldn't really be affected in any manner."
Without a head coach, who also used to double up as the team's bowling coach, Bangar has his work cut out."
Yes, Anil was doubling up. 
There were a lot of positive results under him. 
We all know that the team enjoyed a lot of success. 
Further speaking about the role of the senior players, he said, "It's not only the coaching staff, the mentoring that they do and the exchange of ideas among them, there is a wealth of knowledge which the players benefit from."
Asked what defines the captain-coach relationship, Bangar stressed on trust."
Once you do that, the job and the responsibilities of the coach become that much more easy. 
That is something that I've learnt to work (with)."
Regarding some of the senior pros' future, Bangar was positive.
