Kaabil, his sole release of 2017, takes on Shah Rukh Khan-starrer Raees at the box office on January 25. 
Rakesh Roshan makes box office prediction Kaabil and Raees will be battling for audience's attention. 
We agree that the film needs to have an emotional impact but the way to do (it) is where we will differ.? Which is why there is a lot of hits and moulding. 
This is the second time that a home production starring you is not directed by your father.?  I'm so happy and surprised how three people (Hrithik, Rakesh Roshan and Sanjay Gupta), who are equally headstrong, were working in complete unison. 
Perhaps, I am looking for something that is a little rarer or I want to use my films to express my own self through my interpretations of my experiences.
