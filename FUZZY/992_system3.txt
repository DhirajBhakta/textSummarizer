s future in Bollywood. ?
t say I have not been doing that many films. 
I did an overdose of cinema. 
I needed to take a break. 
This is a period where I need to focus on my children. 
Athiya and Ahan?
s careers are more important to me. 
I think I should take it easy and focus on them and share with them whatever I have learnt,? 
Shetty said.He has been away from the big screen for three years and will be next seen playing the antagonist in ?
A Gentleman?
, starring Sidharth Malhotra. ?
I was away for three and half years and now I am back. 
I have a small but important role in it. 
I have also signed other projects,? 
says Shetty.    
Happy birthday to my hero, my inspiration and undoubtedly the most beautiful soul. 
I love you Papaaaaaaaa?? 
Thank you for being my strength.
