Come April and you won?
t have to go looking for public washrooms to relieve yourself after a long day of shopping in a South Delhi market. 
We want the hotels and restaurants to adhere to the decision in full spirit rather than wait for the SDMC to enforce it,? 
said SDMC commissioner Puneet Goel.?
The hotels and restaurants will also need to put up display boards informing the public about the facilities. 
However, we assume, they don?
t have the provision for washrooms so, the decision doesn?
t apply to them,? 
the official said.The move is expected to spell relief for women who have a particularly hard time for lack of enough public toilets. 
The civic agency is working on the modalities of the move and finalising the amount that can be imposed as penalty on defaulters. ?
Since the issuance of health trade licence is at the discretion of the municipal corporation, we will add this point in its list of terms and conditions next month,? 
said Goel.There are 580 public urinals and 480 toilets in South Delhi. 
Out of 480, only 140 can be used by women. 
These include toilets in Lajpat Nagar, Green Park, Safdarjung Development Area, Rajouri Garden, Bhikaji Cama Place and Nehru place.
