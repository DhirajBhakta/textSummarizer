Turns out the lady wanted to poison him. 
Don't wonder why because KRK himself gives the answer to that.It began with Kamaal Rashid Khan sharing a picture of himself with his mother. 
He captioned it, :Wish you very happy #MothersDay Mom! 
Once upon a time, you wanted to give poison but today you are proud of me.

Apparently, little KRK was too much into watching films. 
According my parents I was worst child of them out of 6 coz I was going to school instead of doing farming n watching films with my friends (sic)," KRK wrote.I could hav been best son of my mother if I didn't go to school but got married with my cousin sister at the age of 15 n becom a good farmerKRK added that he could have been his mother's favourite had he married his cousin sister when he was fifteen years old and then took to farming. 
And so are his kids, apparently.My teachers n colleagues can never forget me because I was always the topper in my class, school n college. 
And today my children are same.And as they say, all's well that ends well.
