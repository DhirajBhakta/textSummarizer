The ex-couple's lawyers Kranti Sathe and Amruta Sathe Pathak confirmed the news to the tabloid.Last year, after months of rumours that Malaika and Arbaaz's marriage was over, the two finally released an official statement declaring the same.In their joint statement, Malaika and Arbaaz said, "The truth is, we have taken a break, but that doesn't mean people can presume, assume and speculate things of such malicious nature. 
We have got a child and our families are involved, but just because we have not said anything till now, it doesn't give anybody the license to speculate on any rubbish about us," added Malaika and Arbaaz.Months of rumours and speculation preceded Malaika and Arbaaz's announcement of separation.
