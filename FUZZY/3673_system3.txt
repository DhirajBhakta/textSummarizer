London, Apr 21 (PTI) Lily - a member of the worlds largest rodent species - has given birth to a pup at a zoo in the UK. 
The six-year-old animal named Lily - who featured in the TV series The Secret Life of the Zoo - delivered her pup at the Chester Zoo. 
The sex of the baby capybara is yet to be determined. 
Capybaras are often referred to as giant guinea pigs and can grow to up to 1.5 metres in length. 
They dwell in small herds on grasslands, in tropical forests and on wetlands across much of South America where they spend much of their time in water.
