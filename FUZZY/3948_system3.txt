Morning walkers on the beach of temple town Puri were in for a shock on Monday when they discovered the body of a dead whale that had been swept ashore by the waves.The 30-feet-long carcass was seen lying on the beach near the Pantha Niwas. 
The carcass resulted in a foul smell that spread across the area and a crane was brought in to lift the dead whale away.This is the second such incident in less than two months on the Puri beach. 
Earlier in February, another such whale carcass was found at Puri's Balukhanda beach.Last year, in December another 42-foot-long whale carcass was recovered from the Baidhara Pentha beach in Puri.Scientists are worried about the trend given the sudden rise in the number of such mammals being killed.
