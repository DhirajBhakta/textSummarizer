Washington, Feb 8 (PTI) FLOTUS, face-palm, net neutrality along with terms from recent advances in science - such as CRISPR - are among over 1,000 new words added to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary for the first time since 2014. 
"The work of revision is ongoing and constant; even though it seems that the latest slang gets the most attention when dictionaries issue lists of new words, the additions come from the whole range of registers and from every corner of the language," the Merriam-Webster Dictionary said in its blog. 
Seussian relating to or suggestive of the works of Dr Seuss is now in the online dictionary, along with conlang - an invented language like Klingon - and prosopagnosia (an inability to recognise faces).
