In a move being hailed as historic by many, Pope Francis has given the Vatican Museums their first-ever female director. 
Dr Barbara Jatta, presently the Deputy Director of the museums, will reportedly assume office on January 1, 2017. 
In doing so, Dr Jatta will become the "highest-ranking female administrator in the Vatican," a report in New York Times reads. 
The top administrative positions at the ancient Vatican Museums, are generally dominated by bishops and cardinals, but Jatta's recent appointment as the director seems like a ray of hope for women everywhere.
