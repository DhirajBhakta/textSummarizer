first transferring 80 and subsequently 245 commissioner rank officials across the country.Just few days before this, on May 31, the CBDT also transferred over 50 chief commissioners of the department across the country.A senior department official said these three lists in quick intervals can be billed as the largest scale of transfers done in the department in the last few years.?
