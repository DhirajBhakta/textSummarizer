Shortly after the conclusion of campaigning for the second round of polling for the Uttar Pradesh assembly election, a confident and assertive akhilesh yadav met with Group Editorial Director Raj Chengappa, India Today (Hindi) editor Anshuman Tiwari and Ashish Misra at his residence in Lucknow. 
The UP chief minister spoke on a range of issues- from the fight within his family to the alliance he has forged with the Congress. 
It has created an environment in favour of the SP... and our getting together with the Congress has given us the image of being a progressive party. 
The previous BSP government had started many schemes; had I discontinued them, I would have been accused of stalling the previous government's work.
