Aadhaar-issuing authority UIDAI has asked states to ensure that all enrolments, even those by private agencies, shift to government or municipal premises from external sites by September this year.The move will have a bearing on 25,000 active enrolment centres across India and ensure that they come under direct supervision of the authorities.It is also expected to curb cases of overcharging by private operators as enrolment and updation can be closely monitored by the government, under the new arrangement.Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) CEO Ajay Bhushan Pandey has written to the states asking them to identify centres within government premises for enrolment and updation activities by July 31.UIDAI has said the process of shifting enrolment operations to such centres should be completed by August 31, 2017.When contacted, Pandey confirmed this saying the enrolment centres will have to shift from private locations into government premises such as district collectorates, zila parishad offices or municipal offices.They could also be re-located at banks, block offices, taluk offices or other delivery offices run by state government where direct supervision can be ensured.CONVENIENCE FOR RESIDENTSAccording to Pandey, shifting of the enrolment operations into state premises would result in greater convenience for residents."
