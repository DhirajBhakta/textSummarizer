From Sajjad Hussain Islamabad, Jan 5 (PTI) Claiming that Kashmir was an "integral part" of Pakistan, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif today needled India yet again by praising slain Hizbul Mujahideen militant Burhan Wani as a "vibrant and charismatic leader". 
The world needs to tell India that "enough is enough" with regard to its policy towards Kashmir, he said, while asserting that Kashmir is an "integral part" of Pakistan. 
Referring to the four points he presented before the UN, Sharif once again urged the world community to make all out efforts for the realisation of the promise it made to the Kashmiri people seventy years ago.
