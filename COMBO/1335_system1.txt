Medium and Small Enterprises occupy bulk of economic activities and are also instrumental in providing maximum employment to people.? However, since they do not get many exemptions, they end up paying more taxes as compared to large companies.? As per data of financial year 2015-16, 2.85 lakh companies making profit of less than Rs 1 crore pay effective tax rate of 30.26% while 298 companies making profit above Rs 500 crores pay effective tax rate of 25.90%.156.? In order to make MSME companies more viable and also to encourage firms to migrate to company format, I propose to reduce the income tax for smaller companies with annual turnover upto Rs 50 crore to 25%.? As per data of Assessment Year 2015-16, there are 6.94 lakh companies filing returns of which 6.67 lakh companies fall in this category and, therefore, percentage-wise 96% of companies will get this benefit of lower taxation.
