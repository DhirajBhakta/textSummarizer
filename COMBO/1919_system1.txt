The Delhi government will invite fresh applications for guest teaching positions in its school and will appoint teachers based on merit.The government?
s move is a change of stance as it had earlier allowed the already employed guest teachers to continue in the last two years.The move comes two days after a group of guest teachers protested against chief minister Arvind Kejriwal at a government function. 
The function was organised to announce measures taken by the government for the benefit of guest teachers, that included 40-90% hike in their salaries.?
The government is doing so much for the guest teachers and yet the teachers are playing politics.
