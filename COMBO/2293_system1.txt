 The Noida authority has decided to paint road marks with an aim to streamline traffic movement on city roads.  
s traffic cell found out that 80% of road markings in the city are either washed away or fade out on their own. 
Once the road and lane marks are in place, they will help the traffic police in regulating the flow of traffic,? 
The project involves marking of zebra crossings, left-right turns, stop lines for vehicles and designated spaces for pedestrians, who often face problems negotiating traffic without adequate markings on roads. 
The traffic police recently installed close circuit television cameras (CCTVs) at intersections in Sector 57/22 and Sector 2/19 for better traffic management. ?
