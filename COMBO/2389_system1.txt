Third set: Federer 7-6, 7-6, 5-3 Berdych* (*denotes next server)How does Federer back up the break? 
t get that missed break point out of his mind. 15-30 on his serve, and he looks annoyed. 
Third set: Federer 7-6, 7-6, 2-2 Berdych* (*denotes next server)15-0, 30-0, 40-0, game Federer. 
s still 5-2 ahead and he now has two points on his serve ... a gasp as Federer loses the point for 5-3 ... but a cheer and standing ovation as he brings up three set points at 6-3 ... 
s three forehand winners in a row ... make that four, well nearly four because Berdych gets a racket to the ball but he?
