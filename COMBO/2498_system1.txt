The Bureau for Civil Aviation Security (BCAS) conducted dummy checks at Delhi, Pune and few other airports over the past three months. 
In a drill conducted in April, CISF officials failed in the security drill. 
Parts of an improvised explosive device were put in a hand bag without a detonator, and civil aviation officials made an easy entry to the Delhi airport with it. 
Security checks conducted on hand baggage for an Air India flight to Jammu also failed to detect the explosive.It was only then that the CISF, which is responsible for airport security, was informed that it had failed the test. 
Though, we take action against our staff, the BCAS conduct dummy checks by keeping random items related with making a bomb.
