Over 60 retired IAS and IPS officers have written an open letter to the Narendra Modi government asking it to enforce the rule of law and not allow vigilantism to grow. 
The open letter has been signed by 65 officers including noted former bureaucrats Bhaskar Ghose, Harsh Mandar and Wajahat Habibullah. 
They further said, "While we agree that genuine violators should be identified we note with dismay that several of the targeted groups are those who have taken stands against government policies, expressed dissent or supported communities in cases against the state.""
There is a growing hyper-nationalism that reduces any critique to a binary: if you are not with the government, you are anti-national," the retired IAS and IPS officers said, adding, "These actions undermine the rule of law and the Indian Constitution since only the state - through its various organs and institutions - has the power to enforce the law."
