"After considering the reports of Shah Nawaz Committee, Justice G D Khosla Commission and Justice Mukherjee Commission of Enquiry, the government has come to the conclusion that Netaji died in the plane crash on 18.08.1945," the Ministry of Home Affairs replied. 
How can the Centre give such a reply at a time when the matter is still pending," said Chandra Kumar Bose, Netaji's grand nephew and a BJP leader ."
Our first priority is to solve the Netaji mystery," said Chandra Kumar Bose and demanded an apology from the Ministry of Home Affairs for "such an irresponsible act"."
We demand an SIT be constituted which can study the declassified files and give a conclusive scientific report on what exactly happened to Netaji," he said.
