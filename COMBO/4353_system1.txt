On March 7, 1987, a quick single nudged through the slips to a Pakistani bowler named Ejaz Fakih took Sunil Manohar Gavaskar from his innings score of 57 to 58 at the Sardar Patel Stadium in rural Motera outside Ahmedabad. 
That run also took Gavaskar to a territory which, never mind the batsman, even cricket itself had never seen. 
Fifty seven to fifty eight sent Gavaskar from 9,999 to the first 10,000th run in Test cricket. 
Non-striker Kiran More says Gavaskar celebrated that moment like he usually didn't do in cricket. 
He sprinted. 
Or at least that's what it seemed like to millions watching TV because it was an accomplishment that all of India wanted to own quickly.
