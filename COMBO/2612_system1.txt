Even as Indian and Chinese soldiers continue their weeks-long standoff in Doklam near Sikkim, a Chinese embassy official in New Delhi sought to allay fears of other Indo-Sino ties being hit. 
The "long-standing" economic and cultural ties that India and China share will not be hit. 
"Both India and China enjoy long cooperation as our lands are connected," news agency IANS quoted Li Rongrong, Second Secretary in the Economic and Commercial Counsellor's Office of the Chinese Embassy in India, as saying Monday.
