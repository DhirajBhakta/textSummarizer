On a day when Mumbai went to the polls and recorded its highest voting percentage, author Shobhaa De tweeted an image of an overweight man in uniform and mocked the city police's 'heavy' arrangements. 
When the targets of her pun found out what she'd done, they swiftly denied that the man in the photo worked for them, and said they "expected better" from De.

We expect better from responsible citizens like you. https://t.co/OcKOoHO5bXDe posted her tweet after voting was in over in Mumbai.
