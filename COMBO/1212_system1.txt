In the internet age when information flows freely, the government wants to continue its monopoly on news and current affairs programmes over radio waves and has justified its ban on private FM community radio service operators by saying they could threaten "national security." 
In an affidavit filed in the Supreme Court, the Centre said it could not grant permission for broadcast of news content as several anti-national radical elements within the country and also from abroad could misuse it for propagating their agenda.The apex court is hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by the NGO Common Cause in 2013, seeking a direction to the Centre to allow private radio stations and community radios to broadcast news, arguing that radio is a more accessible medium for the masses, particularly the poor.
