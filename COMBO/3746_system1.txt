New Delhi, Apr 18 (PTI) The government is assessing how to bring Vijay Mallya back to India and start judicial proceedings against him, Union Minister Santosh Gangwar said today on a day when the defaulter businessman was arrested in London and released later on bail. 
With Finance Minister Arun Jaitley reportedly taking up Mallyas extradition with the British Prime Minister during her recent visit, Minister of State for Finance Gangwar said loans to the controversial liquor tycoon were granted by public banks during the previous UPA regime. 
Since Mallya left the country, the government has been looking at steps to bring him back, he said.
