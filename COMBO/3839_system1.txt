New Delhi, Apr 11 (PTI) After regulator TRAI nixed its complimentary offer, Reliance Jio today announced a new plan of 1GB 4G data daily for 3 months at Rs 309 for its Prime members but rival Airtel dubbed the offer as a case of "old wine in a new bottle". 
Announcing its new offer, Jio said that under the Rs?309 plan it would provide "unlimited SMS, calling and data (1GB per day at 4G speed) for 3 months on first recharge". 
TRAI had said that Jio will be required to roll back the 3-month complimentary offer in "shortest possible time" but clarified that customers who had already subscribed to the said scheme could avail the benefits till June-end.
