That's the question Kolkata cops are asking as they arrived in Chennai today to arrest Justice CS Karnan. 
The Supreme Court had yesterday sentenced Justice Karnan to six months in jail after finding him guilty of contempt of court.A five-member team of senior police officers reached Chennai, Justice Karnan's home city, to carry out the apex court's judgment. 
The team consists of DGP Raj Kanojia and officers Ranveer Kumar, C. 
Sudhakar, Dipankar Bakshi and Sukumal Kanti Das.The police team has failed to locate Justice Karnan so far and sought help from Chennai counterparts to track the Calcutta High Court judge. 
In first of its kind verdict, the Supreme Court on May 9 ordered arrest of a sitting high court judge on charges of contempt.A seven-judge constitution bench, headed by Chief Justice J S Khehar, said "We are of the unanimous view that Justice C S Karnan committed contempt of court, contempt of judiciary and the process."
