The internal committee will submit its complete report to the CMD of Air India in a week's time.This latest discovery only reaffirms what has been known within the airline's circles for a while - that retiring executives/officials have left with many a precious paintings and artefacts from the airline's collection after retirement, without informing.Air India says it has started a process of detailed audit of its collection, which will include "physical verification, digitisation, cataloguing, classification, proper storage, and putting in place a security system".When India Today contacted Jatin Das, he said he was yet to hear from Air India about 'Flying Apsara' and his other paintings too that he's sought details on.
