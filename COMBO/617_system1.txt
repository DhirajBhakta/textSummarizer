In an understandable attempt to put Paris on display as never before, the race was routed through the Grand Palais with the riders racing under the famous glass roof, originally erected in 1897 for the universal exposition of the turn of the century.For Chris Froome it was but a novel diversion en route to confirmation of his fourth Tour de France victory. 
the Grand Palais detour was further evidence that the Tour is constantly looking for new ways to reinvent itself, and a reminder that it increasingly sees itself as a way of showing this multifaceted country to the world.Lockdown could serve as a metaphor for the Tour as a whole, given the way the overall battle had panned out since the race left D?sseldorf 22 days ago.
