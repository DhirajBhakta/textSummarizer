More than 28,000 children aged less than six years have died in Madhya Pradesh in the past one year due to malnourishment and diseases resulting from it.The state women and child welfare department while accepting that children died because of disease resulting from malnourishment refuses to attribute even a single death to malnourishment.Women and child welfare department minister Archana Chitnis read out an answer to a question raised by Ram Niwas Rawat of the Congress in the ongoing budget session of the Assembly in which she accepted that 28948 children had died in the state in the past one year. 
But I can tell you as far as malnourishment figures are concerned we have improved on all parameters," Archana Chitnis said while talking to India Today.Children have died across the state but we chose to do a reality check in Satna where according to the minister's reply 2167 children below the age of 6 have died due to various reasons.
