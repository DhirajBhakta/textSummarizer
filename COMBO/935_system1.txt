A Somerset cheesemaker has offered a ?500 reward after two of its finest vintage cheddars were stolen during a prestigious show. 
The judges at the Yeovil show had crowned the two hefty blocks of cheese champion and reserve champion and the specimens were being left in a marquee overnight so that they could be admired by members of the public next day. 
Thieves took the blocks, weighing 20kg each and with a retail value of around ?800, and the winners? 
The cheesemakers at Wyke Farms in Bruton, Somerset, were devastated that two of the best blocks they had ever produced have vanished.
