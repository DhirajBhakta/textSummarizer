The man, accused of raping and killing an eight-year-old, was lynched in the Ramgarh thana of Dumka district. 
That incident took place near Bajartand village in Ramgarh district. 
The lynching in Dumka took place after a mob after Mithun Hansda allegedly raped and later killed an eight-year-old girl, local newspaper Prabhat Khabar reported. 
On Tuesday this week, the girl had come to Jalwe village in Dumka district for a wedding. 
She along with a few others girls from the wedding party went to a nearby lake to take a bath where Hansda, in a drunken state, misbehaved with them, Prabhat Khabar reported. 
While a few girls managed to run away, Hansda abducted the eight-year-old, took her to the bank of a river outside Jalwe village and allegedly raped her.
