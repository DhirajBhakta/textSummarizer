"Religious freedom is a principle based not on shared ancestry, culture, ethnicity, or faith but on a shared commitment to liberty - and it lies at the very heart of who we are as Americans," Obama said on Friday.Each year, by Presidential Proclamation, January 16 is declared Religious Freedom Day in the US.Obama urged the country's citizens to reject politics that seeks to target people because of their religion."
And throughout our history, faith communities have helped uphold these values by joining in efforts to help those in need -- rallying in the face of tragedy and providing care or shelter in times of disaster," the US President said.Obama rued that in 2015, nearly 20 percent of hate crime victims in America were targeted because of religious bias."
