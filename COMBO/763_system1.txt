Actor Prachi Desai, who bid goodbye to her TV career in 2009 after doing the popular show Kasamh Se, is miffed with the kind of content Indian television has today. 
She says, ?
Prachi started her career in Bollywood with the 2008 film Rock On! 
She subsequently appeared in films such as Once Upon A Time In Mumbaai (2010) and Bol Bachchan (2012). 
I recently turned down a couple of big films, because they all wanted me to do the same kind of thing again and again. 
adds Prachi, , who is soon going to appear in a short film, Carbon, alongside actors Nawazuddin Siddiqui and Jackky Bhagnani.Follow @htshowbiz for more
