DMK working president MK Stalin has alleged that the ruling AIADMK government has not shown any interest in the ongoing farmers' strike at the Jantar Mantar Delhi. 
Tamil Nadu farmers are protesting at the Jantar Mantar in the national capital from the last two weeks seeking drought-relief package. 
They also want the Centre to waive off the farmer loans.The farmers of Tamil Nadu had a rough season in 2016 and neighboring state Karnataka refused to share Cauvery river water even against the Supreme Court's orders. 
He is only concerned about segregating votes for a Foreign Exchange Regulation Act (FERA) convict in RK Nagar," Stalin said.Many even questioned how the ministers of the state had time to stay in Delhi to attain the twin leaf symbol but couldn't take time out to meet the farmers.
