Cinelovers were shocked when Aamir Khan's Dangal did not make it to the list of the IIFA 2017 nominations. 
Dangal not only received rave reviews from critics, but also went on to become the highest grossing Indian film in cinematic history. 
Naturally, fans were shocked at the snub and expressed their disappointment on social media.However, the organisers have clarified that it was the makers of Dangal who did not send in an entry. 
Andre Timmins, the Director of Wizcraft International, told IANS, "So basically, in IIFA, forms are sent to various production houses. 
They fill those forms up and send it back to us.
