In March this year, Bollywood fans woke up to the news of Manisha Koirala making her big comeback with Sanjay Dutt biopic. 
The 46-year-old actor, who took a hiatus from films after being diagnosed with ovarian cancer, is all set to bounce back after 5 years. 
She will essay the role of Sanjay's mother Nargis Dutt in the biopic directed by Rajkumar Hirani. 
But it's not easy to play Dutt's mother when she has worked with Sanju baba in a handful of films in the 90s. 
Koirala in an interview to Mid-Day opened up on signing the film and playing Nargis Dutt on screen.
