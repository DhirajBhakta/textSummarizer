Kabir Khan's Tubelight has already grabbed eyeballs for the on-screen camaraderie between Salman Khan and Sohail Khan, who play brothers in the film too. 
In fact, Kabir wanted Akshay Kumar to play Salman's on-screen brother in the film. 
"Instead of a real brother, I thought we should get another actor and create the chemistry on screen," he told the daily. 
The director, who has collaborated with Salman for the third time, said that he had a few actors in his mind during the scripting stage, and Khiladi Kumar was one of them. 
Maybe, with another actor, I would have had to spend time and create the chemistry that Salman and Sohail share," he added.
