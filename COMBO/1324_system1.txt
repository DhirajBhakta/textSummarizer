It is a moment that is seared on to the consciousness of Frank Lampard and every Chelsea fan ? 
Not bad for a player who they said would not make it to the top.He was not finished. 
The highlight, surely, was the Champions League final in 2012, when he captained Chelsea, in the absence of the suspended John Terry, to the penalty shootout victory against Bayern Munich.Now, Lampard is finished. 
He was excellent at Euro 2004, scoring three times as England reached the quarter-finals but his subsequent tournament appearances at the World Cups of 2006, 2010 and 2014 were disappointments.Lampard missed his penalty in the quarter-final shootout defeat against Portugal in 2006 and, four years later, his glorious shot in the last?16 against Germany bounced off the crossbar and over the line ?
