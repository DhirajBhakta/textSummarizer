t proof enough of how much the Chinese love the Bollywood star and his latest film, here is some more proof: a video made by Aamir?
s Chinese fan club based on the hit song Dhaakad from Dangal.The video, uploaded by Aamir Khan FC?
We chatted with Wenjing Zhang aka Viki from the fan club, who explained that it was made as a gift for Aamir Khan for his great movie and unmatched acting prowess in it. ?
We chose the song Dhaakad, because Aamirji has sung it (the actor has made his own video version, which is not seen in the film), and he is really cool in the movie, too.?
