The Ranchi Nagar Nigam has upped the ante with its posters on sanitation and building toilets.Posters put up in Ranchi, Jharkhand, took a play on superstar Amitabh Bachchan's movie Sholay, and its hugely popular climax. 
An injured Amitabh can be seen in Dharmendra's arms, who asks him how he got so injured. 
In response, Bachchan's character is shown as saying, "I don't have a toilet at home, so I feel down while trying to relieve myself in the night."
A photo of the poster was shared on Facebook by Congress leader Abhishek Singhvi.
