Mumbai, Jun 5 (PTI) Tiger Shroff said if Nawazuddin Siddiqui, who is a powerhouse performer, starts dancing as well then other actors jobs will be in trouble. 
The story is about a young man from the streets, called Munna, played by Tiger, who is a big fan of Michael Jackson. 
Munna teaches dancing to Mahinder Fauji, played by Nawazuddin, who is a gangster with dancing ambitions. 
"I cant be a dancing hero, but if I get a solo hero film Ill definitely do it but it shouldnt have dancing. 
I danced with a lot of difficulty and learnt a lot by observing Tigers dancing steps.
