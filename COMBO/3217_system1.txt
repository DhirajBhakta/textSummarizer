It never happened ever since the 1984 Sikh riots that I was asked to remove my turban in Gorakhpur," said a visibly moved Singh, who was also thankful to Yogi for his kind gesture.Tejpal, a resident of Gurudwara locality, was overwhelmed to know that the CM will be attending to woes of the people on Friday."
I went to the Gorakhsnath Dham early on Thursday and was successful in getting a pass to meet him," said Singh, flaunting the pass.However, the nightmare began when he reached the last security cordon on Friday afternoon."
Then an altercation took place after which I said whether you allow me to meet the CM or not, I will not take off my turban," Singh added.After all the ruckus, Singh was finally let in.
