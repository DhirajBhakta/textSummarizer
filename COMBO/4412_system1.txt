(Sreesanth denied permission to play in Scotland Premier League)The 34-year-old Sreesanth, who hails from here, had written to former Comptroller and Auditor General Vinod Rai last month, who heads the Supreme Court-appointed Committee of Administrators (CoA) of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), seeking justice as he has lost four years.In his petition that was filed on Wednesday, Sreesanth said that the BCCI disciplinary committee based their report on the Delhi police report.He pointed out that in 2015, Delhi court exonerated him and two other players in the case registered by the Delhi Police which invoked the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) and hence his life ban should be lifted.Sreesanth was crestfallen when the outgoing leadership of the BCCI treated him, especially denying him an NOC to play in this year's edition of the Scotland Cricket league.
