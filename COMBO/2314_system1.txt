The sentence for killing cow is five, seven or 14 years in different states, but the sentence for causing the death of a human being through rash or negligent driving is only two years,? 
additional sessions judge Sanjeev Kumar said.The court held the accused, 30-year-old Utsav Bhasin, guilty of rash driving, voluntarily causing hurt on provocation and causing death by negligence. 
The bail bond was fixed at Rs 50,000 with surety of a similar amount.Bhasin was earlier cleared of culpable homicide, which provides for a maximum jail term of up to 10 years.The court said a copy of the judgment must be sent to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, so he can consider steps to enhance the punishment prescribed for such offences under section 304-A of the Indian Penal Code.
