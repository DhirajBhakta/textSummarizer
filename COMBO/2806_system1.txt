We got her (Seema) married to Sanjiv Kumar about seven years ago and soon he and his family members started harassing her mentally and physically for dowry," Swaroop said. 
"Once, when Seema was alive, we went to the police station to file a complaint against the atrocities, but the cop present there suggested Seema hang herself rather than come to them," alleged Swaroop.He also said the police were asking for money to prepare a final report and arrest the other accused.
