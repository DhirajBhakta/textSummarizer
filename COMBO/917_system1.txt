Kamal Haasan and Bigg Boss Tamil is involved in yet another controversy, as K Krishnaswamy, leader of Puthiya Tamizhagam has threatened to file a Rs 100 crore defamation case against the actor and the channel for what a contestant said during the show.? One of the contestants, Gayathri Raghuram used the word cheri (which mean slum dweller) for a co-contestant, which received a lot of criticism from the viewers. 
Politician K Krishnaswamy wants Kamal Haasan to apologise for Gayathri's comment.? While talking to The Times Of India, the politician said, "In the show, there was a conversation between two contestants. 
They are creating an imbalance in the society and hurting one particular section of the society."
