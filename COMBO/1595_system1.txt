Eighteen years ago, Sasi Gangadharan, a coconut tree climber from the outskirts of Kerala's Thiruvananthapuram district, fell down from a coconut tree. 
The fall paralysed the right side of his body and he was bed-ridden for years, with no job or source of income. 
Sasi reached out to the panchayat to help him with a three-wheeler to set up a small business, but they turned down his repeated requests stating that there is no motorable road till his house. 
Seeing his plea falling on deaf years, the semi-paralysed man decided to make things work, all by himself. 
The 59-year-old man got his hands on a pickaxe, a shovel, and carved out a 200-metre stretch of kachha road through the plateau, working 6 hours daily for the past three years.? Talking to India Today, Sasi said, "the old route to my house was from above that plateau.
