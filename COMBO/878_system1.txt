The Basant Lok complex, popularly known as Priya?
s, was once a favourite hangout spot in South Delhi. 
But with fast depleting infrastructure and civic amenities, the area was losing competition to nearby malls.The Delhi Development Authority will spend Rs 10 crore to revamp the complex with spacious lanes, an amphitheatre, extra parking, an open plaza, more toilets, rainwater harvesting system and sewage treatment plant facility.?
The plan has been approved by lieutenant governor Anil Baijal and the work will start in the next three months,? 
said a DDA official. 
An survey of the area showed lack of fire safety arrangements, broken walkways and choked drains, he said. ?
