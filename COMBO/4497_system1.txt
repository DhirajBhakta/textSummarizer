A day after the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation polls threw up a fractured verdict, senior BJP leader Nitin Gadkari today said there is "no option" for his party and Shiv Sena than joining hands for control of the Mumbai civic body."
The situation now is that both parties have no option but to come together again," Gadkari said."
The final decision on this issue has to be taken by Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis and Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray. 
I feel leaders of both parties have to take a decision, showing sujh bujh (understanding) and maturity," Gadkari told a Marathi TV channel.He singled out Sena mouthpiece 'Saamana' for its targeting of PM Narendra Modi and BJP president Amit Shah."
