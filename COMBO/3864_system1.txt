The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) is set to launch its housing scheme in May this year. 
DMRC is building 2BHK and 3BHK flats in the city?
s Janakpuri and Okhla areas in Delhi that will cost between Rs 60 lakh and Rs 1.20 crore. 
Brochures will be released next month with an application form to book a flat, which DMRC promises to deliver by 2019. ?
We have identified two plots near Okhla and Janakpuri (west) metro stations. 
We will construct 460 flats in Janakpuri and 90 in Okhla. 
The flats will be allotted on the basis of a draw and people can apply as soon as we open the scheme.
