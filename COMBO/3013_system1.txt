Diana was so unhappy in the few weeks after her fairy tale wedding with Prince Charles that she tried to slash her wrists, according to the transcripts of secret tapes of the popular princess. 
"I was so depressed, and I was trying to cut my wrists with razor blades," The Princess of Wales is quoted as saying. 
By October (1981) I was in a very bad way," she said. 
"I was so depressed, and I was trying to cut my wrists with razor blades. 
I came down early (to London) to seek treatment, not because I hated Balmoral, but because I was in such a bad way.
