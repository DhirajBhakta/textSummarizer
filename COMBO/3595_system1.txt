Pakistan has called off their scheduled cricket tour of Bangladesh this year, the country's board chairman Shaharyar Khan has said. 
Pakistan has since travelled to Bangladesh in 2011 and 2015 and were scheduled to play two Tests, three ODIs and a Twenty20 International in July and August in the South Asian country.Khan said Bangladesh had failed to reciprocate Pakistan's visits with the Bangladesh Cricket Board turning down an invitation to play two T20 internationals in Pakistan."
We had spoken about the possibility of hosting them (Bangladesh in Pakistan) this year," the PCB chairman told ESPNcricinfo."
Pakistan have now toured Bangladesh twice without them reciprocating, and we feel we cannot tour Bangladesh for the third straight time.
