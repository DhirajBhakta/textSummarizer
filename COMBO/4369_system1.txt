A BJP MP has moved a private member's bill in the Lok Sabha, seeking reservation of five seats in the Lower House as well as one in the Rajya Sabha for residents of Gilgit and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) regions. 
"It is a matter of extreme surprise that the Lower House does not take into account this territory, whereas the State Legislature of Jammu and Kashmir keeps 25 seats vacant for the territory which is under illegal occupation of Pakistan," said Nishikant Dubey, who has piloted the bill. 
"It would be proper that seats provided for the Jammu and Kashmir area, which is under illegal occupation of Pakistan, in the Lok Sabha are kept vacant as elections can not be held in these areas," he said.
