The image of Russian President Vladimir Putin embracing the US President Donald Trump from behind was projected on some buildings in New York and neighbourhoods Williamsburg and Chelsea with hashtag #LoveThroughHate.More than being a part of an anti-Trump resistance which has lingered since he started campaigning for the US President post, this was a publicity stunt by a dating app.It wasn't entirely a politically driven move but an ad campaign by a dating app called Hater.Hater app matches potential dates based on the things people mutually hate. 
You can get yourself a date using Hater if both the persons hate a similar thing.
