In what could be considered as a controversial comment, former union minister Jairam Ramesh on Monday said north India was more tolerant than south India.Speaking at India Today Conclave-South, Ramesh said, "If I have to choose a place to live, I will choose in north India. 
Traveling in Bihar, UP and Jharkhand, I find that people are more tolerant, more cosmopolitan there. 
He said, "I find the elites of south India are rooted elsewhere - in USA, Germany, Scotland and all such places. 
They have become global citizens but they need to be the citizens of India first," Ramesh said at the India Today Conclave.
