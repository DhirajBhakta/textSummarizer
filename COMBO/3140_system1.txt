The Inter-Services Intelligence agency plans to send as many as 14 operatives to the India-Pakistan Champions Trophy match on Sunday with the aim of displaying banners related to Kashmir, sources have told India Today. 
According to the sources, the agents have been asked to display A3 placards bearing pro-Kashmir freedom messages during the Champions Trophy clash in Edgbaston, England. 
Pakistan's intelligence agency has instructed its agents to display these slogans: 'Kashmir Seeks Attention', 'Kashmir is bleeding', 'We stand with Kashmir', and 'Free the state of Jammu and Kashmir now'. 
The idea seems to be to grab international attention should one of the cameras on the ground get any of the banners in frame.
