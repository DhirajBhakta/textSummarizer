Statistics boils down to nine such marriages a day.Known as Pakadwa Vivah (marriage by abduction), the tradition is simple: zero-in on a prospective groom, kidnap him and make him tie the nuptial knot at gunpoint. 
On the other hand, only eight cases of kidnappings for ransom - which Bihar was once infamous for - have been registered during this period.Clearly, abduction for marriage is almost like an established, acceptable trend in Bihar. 
So, families without wherewithal to arrange a decent dowry resort to desperate measures like abducting a suitable bridegroom for their daughter's marriage," says Ashok Priyadarshi, a teacher in Nawada, a district infamous for such marriages.DIRECT CONSEQUENCE OF SOCIAL EVILS LIKE DOWRYThough illegal, dowry is an inevitable traditional marriage practice by which the groom's family demands enormous sums of money and goods from the bride's family as a condition for letting their son marry her.Families resort to snatch men - often young boys- because it is easier than approaching boy's families and cheaper than paying the standard "dowry," which is in lakhs plus a vehicle.Kamta Singh, Chairman of a Primary Agriculture Credit Society in Rampur, Navada claimed that almost 90 per cent marriages in the village have been solemnised by kidnapping a bridegroom.
