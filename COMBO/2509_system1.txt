Perhaps it?
The aspiring model from Minneapolis, Minnesota was only 10 years old when she was diagnosed with a rare type of skin disorder, Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, reported mirror.co.uk, that causes skin and joints to stretch beyond normal.    
A post shared by Sara Geurts (@sarageurts) on May 1, 2017 at 10:37am PDT Sara first noticed something different about her body, says the report, when she was just seven. 
Because of little information and awareness about the skin problem, Sara had to undergo numerous tests before it was established that she had the disorder that was causing severe acne and sores on the top of her hairline and making the skin on her body loose and stretchy.
