Taapsee and Akshay Kumar have been creating awareness about self-defence and even made a video urging women to learn to protect themselves and demonstrating techniques for the same. 
She tells IndiaToday.in, "Thankfully, since the time I have learnt it, no. 
I guess no one wants to take on me after that (laughs). 
I'm very gullible, I take everything at face value," the actor elaborates.The toughest part of getting into Shabana's shoes was not the physical aspect of it, contrary to what people think. 
To give each shot keeping in mind all the characteristics of this girl, who is completely opposite to me, was pretty taxing," Taapsee reveals.And after back-to-back "intense" films, she is going to take a break and do a fun, glamourous role in Judwaa 2.
