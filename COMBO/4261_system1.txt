A mother-of-two jumped off a first-floor apartment in east Delhi on Sunday and called up the police to say she was abducted and gang-raped by five men.Cops have arrested the accused, who claim they brought the woman home for "paid sex" during a Holi party. 
All the men are in their twenties. 
The fifth accused was allegedly known to the woman.Officers MAIL TODAY spoke to said they are trying it ascertain if it was a "deal gone wrong" but, citing last year's Bollywood courtroom drama Pink, emphasised the importance of consent and that "no means no"."
Allegedly to save herself after being gang-raped by five men, a 28-year-old divorcee and mother-of-two leapt from the first floor of a rented accommodation in east Delhi's Pandav Nagar on Sunday morning," an officer said.The definition of rape is not restricted to cases where violence is used, or where a man jumps out of the bushes and drags a woman at knifepoint down an alleyway and sexually assaults her, experts say.
