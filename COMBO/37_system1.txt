London, Aug 1 (PTI) Renowned Harry Potter author J K Rowling has apologised for wrongly accusing US President Donald Trump of refusing to shake the hand of a 3-year-old disabled child during an event. 
The 52-year-old British novelist, best known as the author of the Harry Potter fantasy series, said yesterday that she deleted her July 28 tweets after she was informed that they were "not a full or accurate representation" of what had happened at last Mondays health care event at the White House. 
Rowling came under fire for a series of now-deleted tweets in which she slammed Trump for seeming to ignore Montgomery Weers outstretched hand.
