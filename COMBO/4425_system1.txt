Tokyo, Feb 27 (PTI) Scientists have created a highly flexible material that is tougher than steel, by combining hydrogels with woven glass fibre fabric, which may have a wide range of potential applications. 
Researchers from Hokkaido University in Japan focused on creating a reinforced material using hydrogels. 
Though such a substance has potential as a structural biomaterial, up until now no material reliable and strong enough for long-term use has been produced. 
To address the problem, the team combined hydrogels containing high levels of water with glass fibre fabric to create bendable, yet tough materials, employing the same method used to produce reinforced plastics.
