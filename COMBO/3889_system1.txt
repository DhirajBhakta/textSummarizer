A bar in Kerala has come up with an exceptional way to get around the new rule banning alcohol near highways.Aishwarya Restobar in Paravoor, Ernakulam, now has a full-blown maze around the building, much like in Harry Potter and the Goblet of fire (the Triwizard Tournament, duh?).
The only way to get around this was to take the bar further away from the national highway.Hence, as The News Minute reports, the owner of Aishwarya Restobar built the 250- 300 metre long maze to increase the distance between his bar and the nearest highway.So, technically, the bar is not longer 'situated within 500 metres from the highway???.
