New Delhi, Jul 4 (PTI) Producer Ekta Kapoor has said she came up with a "sassy promo" for "Lipstick Under My Burkha" as she wanted the film to reach out to wider audiences rather than being confined to the art film zone. 
The movie hit a roadblock with the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) soon after Ekta came onboard as a distributor but it only strengthened her desire to take the movie to the masses. 
I saw the film and realised we really live in a world where as women we are not allowed to do or say anything. 
After the film was cleared for release, Ektas team came up with an edgy poster of the film, which depicts a woman showing her middle finger.
