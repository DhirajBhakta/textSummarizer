New Delhi, Jul 9 (PTI) Now, differently-abled passengers will not face any problem in getting a lower berth in Third AC coaches as the Indian Railways has fixed quota for Divyangs in 3AC of mail and express trains to make the journey hassle- free. 
Currently, there is a provision for lower berth quota in sleeper class only. 
A lower berth in 3AC coach will be reserved for Divyangs in trains and the necessary software is being readied for this, said a senior Railway Ministry official. 
The railway move comes close on the heels of an incident in which a wheelchair-bound athlete faced difficulty in securing a lower berth.
