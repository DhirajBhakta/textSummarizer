20 years ago, Salman Khan entertained the audiences with his dual avatar in David Dhawan's hit film Judwaa. 
And after two decades, the Bajrangi Bhaijaan actor plans to do exactly the same but with a twist. 
It is a known fact that David Dhawan has begun shooting for Judwaa 2 with son Varun Dhawan, and if reports are to be believed, Salman too will be seen in the film. 
There was speculation that Salman might make a special appearance in one of the two chartbusters from the first instalment - Oonchi Hai Building or Tan Tana Tan, but nothing has been confirmed as of now.The final leg of shooting of Judwaa 2 will begin in June.
