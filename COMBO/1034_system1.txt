Ward number 220 of Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has perhaps turned out to be the most keenly contested seat between BJP and Shiv Sena anywhere in Maharashtra in the just-concluded civic elections. 
Atul Shah, the BJP candidate, was a former MLA contesting against Shiv Sena's Surendra Bagalkar. 
So it came as a shock that the MLA had lost the municipal corporation election.? After the counting was over, the Sena's Bagalkar was declared the winner. 
But that was not to be.Atul Shah challenged the result. 
He demanded recounting of votes.Recounting was done not once but for three times. 
And in all the three rounds, there was a tie between Shah and Bagalkar.
