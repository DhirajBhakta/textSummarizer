? These were the questions fired at Sreelakshmi Satheesh, CEO of an educational consultancy firm in Kerala and a motivational speaker, when she attended a call from an unknown number.? Since then, her phone rang a number of times, all unknown numbers. 
She turned her phone on, dialed one of the numbers from which she had gotten a call earlier and spoke to the fellow who answered with nauseating enthusiasm. 
He shuddered when Sreelakshmi told him about her profile and soon began begging for forgiveness. 
Learning that the man who posted her number on the group was an acquaintance, someone who used to wear the mask of a decent man whenever they interact, and most of all, the regional secretary of the youth wing of a national party, Sreelakshmi decided to act, to file a police case.Party workers, who realised Sreelakshmi is going to the cops, began calling her, apologised, and pleaded with her to settle the matter outside the court.
