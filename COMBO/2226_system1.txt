The Central Pollution Control Board is planning to develop a Delhi-specific driving cycle and location-specific air quality management plans with the money which manufacturers and dealers have deposited with it over the past one year as Environment Protection Charge,? 
On August 12, 2016 the Supreme Court had directed all dealers and manufacturers to deposit 1% levy of ex-showroom price for every diesel car and SUV with engine capacity 2000cc and above sold in Delhi-NCR as environment protection charge. 
If we get to know the driving cycle of Delhi it would help us to bring down the pollution levels by doing away with those elements on the roads which cause pollution,?
