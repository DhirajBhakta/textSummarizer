The Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), has decided to do away with the procedure to speed up the check in process from April 1. 
In December, CISF had started trial runs for this but stamping was resumed after a week due to security concerns. 
The BCAS had in February issued an order announcing that the procedure was to be done away with but the CISF had at that time object to immediate implementation of the plan. 
The cycle of security check will speed up and our staff will get more time to check suspicious baggage,? 
CISF DG OP Singh said.Recently, CISF had conducted trial runs in two phases at 12 airports and concluded that stamping of baggage tags could be dispensed with after certain modifications of security architecture in Security Hold Areas of the airports and installation of high definition CCTV cameras.
