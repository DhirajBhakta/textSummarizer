A Delhi police cop has been suspended for getting drunk and flashing in front of a woman colleague at the police training college. 
The incident was reported by the woman officer who informed her seniors on Saturday night. 
Police sources said the cop, posted at the police training college in Jharoda Kalan, had also inappropriately touched two women constables at dinner. 
At around 6pm, inside the mess, the cop who was reportedly reeking of alcohol touched two women constables. 
They threatened to inform their superiors if he did not apologise. 
An hour later, another woman constable alleged that the cop had stripped and masturbated in front of her.
