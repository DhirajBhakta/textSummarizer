Usain Bolt has issued a stark warning to his fellow athletes that they must stop doping otherwise track and field will die. 
The triple Olympic 100m and 200m champion insisted that the sport was on the mend following the staggering revelations of state-sponsored doping in Russia but conceded more needed to be done to tackle the scourge of performance-enhancing drugs.?
And hopefully they will understand what the sport is going through and what they need to do as athletes to help it move forward.?
But Bolt, who will hang up his spikes after the world championships in London which start on Friday, said he was still optimistic that these perennial problems could be tackled. ?
