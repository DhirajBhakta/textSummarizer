A high-profile nursery school in Delhi landed in soup recently for organising a monkey dance for the entertainment of its students. 
The Cambridge Montessori Preschool in Ashoka Niketan, Anand Vihar, apparently fetched a madari to cheer its kids, and had to pay for it by removing its principal after Union Minister Maneka Gandhi intervened. 
Pankaj Kumar, owner of the school, who has a franchise for Cambridge Global, told MAIL TODAY, "We are all animal lovers. 
It seems the principal didn't know it is illegal to hold monkey dance shows. 
After I got a call from Maneka Gandhi herself enquiring about the incident, I found out about it and removed the Principal."
