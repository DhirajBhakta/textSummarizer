 A man who was on the run for 12 years after murdering a 65-year-old woman in Delhi was arrested from Dwarka sector 16-A on Saturday.The accused, Raju alias Painter (33), and his three associates - Dharmender, Arun Kumar and Vikas Yadav - had murdered Indira Devi (65) at her Vikaspuri flat late on January 25 night in 2004. 
Raju was a small-time civil contractor and was hired by Devi to paint her flat. 
He deputed Dharmender, Arun and Vikas for this work. 
On realising that Devi was living alone in the flat -- her only daughter was settled abroad -- the men robbed and murdered her.
