of these tiger reserves.The 11-member team says estimating monetary values of ecosystem services from biodiversity can help in making conservation more appealing and benefits from biodiversity more visible to policy makers.The team led by Professor Madhu Verma from the Indian Institute of Forest Management, Bhopal, says tiger reserves in India not only support more than half of the global tiger population and are cornerstones of biodiversity conservation, they also provide a wide range of economic, social and cultural benefits in the form of ecosystem services.?
he says.The team analysed the economic benefits accruing to the country from Corbett Tiger Reserve that is home to 215 tigers, Kanha Reserve (80 tigers), Kaziranga (106), Periyar Reserve (35), Ranthambore (46), and the Sunderbans Tiger Reserve (76).The tiger estimates are all from 2014 when the National Tiger Conservation Authority gave its last countrywide census figures.A simple back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests that each tiger has a flow benefit of about USD 2.19 million per year.This can be viewed as the interest one earns annually by conserving each tiger.
