A day after the 88th Annual Academy Awards in February this year, Priyanka Chopra was the most searched person on Google after Leonardo DiCaprio, who had just won his first academy award for best actor. 
In PeeCee's words, she found it bizarre that she came in second after bechara (poor) Leo and that, after all, she was another girl in a dress at the world's biggest motion pictures' event and also that it had just been three months since she made her American small-screen debut with Quantico's first season. 
THE DRESSPeeCee's dress was completely sheer and when she wore the now viral Oscar dress, Priyanka realised that the lining of the dress started from her knees, thus the top was effectively see-through.
