Actor Emraan Hashmi has been in the Hindi film industry for almost 14 years, but the one film which he considers a career-changer was Once Upon A Time In Mumbaai (2010). 
The multi-starrer featuring actors Ajay Devgn, Kangana Ranaut, Randeep Hooda and Prachi Desai was a hit with both the audiences and critics.?
I had worked with Kangana before this film, and Prachi and Randeep were amazing too. 
Ajay Devgn played the role of Sultan Mirza, while Emraan Hashmi was his nemesis ShoaibEmraan played the role of the rebellious Shoaib based on a real-life underworld don. 
His character locks horns with the smuggling overlord of Mumbai, Sultan Mirza, played by Ajay Devgn.
