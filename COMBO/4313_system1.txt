Former Pakistan leg spinner Danish Kaneria, serving a life ban on charges of spot-fixing has appealed to the cricket authorities to have his case revisited by the inquiry tribunal set-up to probe into the allegations against Pakistani batsmen, Sharjeel Khan and Khalid Latif.The PCB had earlier announced a three-member tribunal headed by former Lahore high court judge, Asghar Haider to hold proceedings against Sharjeel and Khalid.The other members of the tribunal include former Chairman of the board, Lt General (retd) Tauqir Zia and former test captain, Wasim Bari."
I have been saying all along that the anti-corruption panel of the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) imposed the life ban on me based on the statement of my Essex teammate Mervyn Westfield, who himself has told lies about me and had to be forcibly summoned to attend the hearings," Kaneria told PTI on Thursday.Kaneria said his case was heard and decided in the United Kingdom and his lawyers and he remained unsatisfied with the way the hearings were heard."
