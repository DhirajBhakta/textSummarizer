It was on this day, 100 years ago, that an event changed the course of Delhi's history forever. 
The Delhi Durbar on December 12, 1911 was marked as a celebration of the coronation of King Emperor George V. 
Delhi had witnessed two such durbars before, in 1877 and 1903, but the Delhi Durbar of 1911 assumed unusual importance as King George V announced the shifting of British India's capital from Calcutta to Delhi.As chronicled by HT over the past year in the series New Delhi 100, Delhi in 1911 was just a small town in the Punjab province, still recovering from the wounds inflicted on it by the British regime after the uprising of 1857.
