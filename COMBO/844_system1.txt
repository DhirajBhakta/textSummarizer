Golden Baba, who is famous for participating in Kanwar Yatra wearing gold ornaments, has added a gold chain weighing two kilograms to his collection. 
Baba aka Sudhir Makkar is well known throughout the 200km yatra route from Hardwar to Delhi.The addition of the chain has taken Baba?
s gold ornaments to about 14.5kgs which include a collection of 21 gold chains, 21 lockets of deities, armlets and even a gold jacket which he wears sometimes during the yatra sitting atop his SUV which is one among the cavalcade of 16 vehicles that accompany him.?
I am not wearing much gold on this journey as its weight has affected my nerves at the neck and also affected vision of one eye.
