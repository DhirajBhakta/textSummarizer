The 31-year-old shot to fame with the chartbuster song Sunn Raha Hai Na Tu from the film Aashiqui 2 (2013). 
Other hits include Tu Hai Ki Nahin (Roy, 2015), Dil Cheez Tujhe Dedi (Airlift, 2016), Tere Liye (Sanam Re, 2016). 
People only like singers till the time their songs are featured in films, ya jab tak kisi bade hero ki playback karte hain (or as long as one sings playback for a major star),? 
Singing for someone else means that singers aur musicians ki apni koi pehchaan nahi hoti (singers and musicians get no recognition on their own). 
m searching for that pehchaan (identity / recognition) through my independent singles,?
