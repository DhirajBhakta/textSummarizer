The Delhi Police, however, said they will begin internal probe in the matter and challenge the order in high court if the charges were found to be false.Additional sessions judge Vinod Yadav, on Monday, passed the order after the 13-year-old girl told the court that she was sexually assaulted by the woman investigating officer (IO) of the case and she had lodged a complaint with the police against her but no action was taken.The court also dismissed the third bail plea of the teacher of a government school, facing prosecution in the case, saying there was no change in circumstances.?
the officer said.The girl, in her complaint, alleged that the IO had threatened her father to get the victim medically re-examined or she would implicate her in a false case.The child alleged that initially the woman official sexually assaulted her and later took her to a hospital where the doctors conducted her internal medical examination without her consent.The police which is already probing the aspect of sexual assault on the minor by her teacher, had earlier informed the court that it has also registered an FIR against the girl?
