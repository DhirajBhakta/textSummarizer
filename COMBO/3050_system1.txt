New Delhi, Jun 11 (PTI) Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi, whose three-year tenure will end on June 19, has asked the government not to consider him for reappointment to the post. 
Rohatgi told PTI that he had written to the government last month conveying his wish to discontinue as Attorney General and return to private practice. 
He said the extension given to him by the government earlier this month was "adhoc", till further orders, as it was done when the Prime Minister was on a visit to Russia. 
Rohatgi said that he maintained a "good relationship" with the government and would come to its aid as and when required.
