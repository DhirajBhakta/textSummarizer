India's star Test batsman Cheteshwar Pujara has made it a point to score big on every given opportunity. 
After leading Rest of India to Irani Cup success with an unbeaten 116, Pujara said, "it was a perfect practice match for the next half of the 13 Test-match season in India."
Speaking exclusively to India Today, Pujara talked about winning his favourite No.3 batting spot back and sledging the Australians during their four-match Test series in February and March. 
Cheteshwar, it must feel good to go in with runs under your belt as you approach the five Test matches ahead, one against Bangladesh and four vs Australia.A.
