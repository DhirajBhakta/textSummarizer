In an unprecedented verdict, a Delhi court on Wednesday awarded a two-month jail term to a school principal and its director for causing mental trauma to a 7-year-old girl by not allowing her to enter the classroom. 
It took us over two months to find another school, and my child remained at home all this while for no fault of hers,? 
He said that instead of keeping her in the class with her classmates, she was wrongly confined to various other places in the school where neither children were present nor any activity was going on. 
s father said that he had raised questions against the arbitrary increase in school fees and accessory charges, after which the school management sought to evict his daughter with a transfer certificate. ?
