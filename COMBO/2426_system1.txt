By Komal Panchmatia New York, Jul 14 (PTI) Salman Khan has never been a favourite at award shows but the superstar has no complains as he said he prefers performing at such ceremonies over receiving an honour. 
I have got some supporting actor award. 
I like rewards more than awards," Salman told reporters here at the International Indian Film Academy (IIFA) awards press conference last evening. 
The moment my name was announced, I stood up to receive the award but it went to Jackie. 
I dont go and receive awards, I just go and perform." 
The actor joked that even though he was not the best dancer, organisers are always ready to pay him a fat cheque.
