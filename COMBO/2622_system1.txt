Various ambassadors and envoys keep meeting Congress president and vice-president time to time on courtesy basis. 
The envoys met Rahul Gandhiji... not only Chinese envoy, but also the Bhutanese envoy and the ex-National Security Advisor Shiv Shankar Menon," Congress spokesperson RS Surjewala said, adding that one should not "sensationalise" the meeting."
"They should reverify that we still have diplomatic relations with all our neighbours," Surjewala said.Congress social media head Ramya said the issue was not if Gandhi met the Chinese envoy or now and questioned why the Prime Minister did not flag the border issue with Chinese President Xi Jinping when the two leaders met last week at the G20 Summit in Hamburg, Germany."
