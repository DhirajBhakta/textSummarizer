Actor-singer Suchitra Krishnamoorthi, who finds herself in an eye of a storm over her tweet about the "aggressive/ ear shattering call of azaan", defended herself saying she doesn't have a problem the call but just wants the "loud sound" to be dealt with. 
Krishnamoorthi raked up controversy on Sunday after posting an early-morning tweet that read, "came (sic) home at 4.45 am 2 (to) most aggressive/ ear shattering call of azaan. 
Some, like AIMIM MLA Waaris Pathan indulged in taking personal potshots, calling her a "cheap singer" who tweeted what she tweeted for "publicity." 
Samajwadi Party leader Abu Azmi was even more personal in his attack, saying how "these type of women" have "made Indian culture a laughing stock".
