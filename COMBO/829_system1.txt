New Delhi, Jul 20 (PTI) After its Centre-funded restoration plan got shelved, the NDMC has decided to redevelop the iconic 150-year-old Town Hall in old Delhi through public-private partnership, the civic body today said. 
North Delhi Mayor Preety Agarwal said the redevelopment of the Town Hall in Chandni Chowk -- the headquarters of the erstwhile unified MCD -- into a centre of cultural and social heritage would be taken up on a PPP model. 
"An in-principle approval has been accorded for the PPP project," she said. 
North Delhi Municipal Commissioner Praveen Gupta said the restoration was initially planned to be funded by the Union Tourism Ministry but "could not be materialised on that front and now it would be developed on a PPP mode".
