In an interview to DNA, when Salman was asked about superstardom, he said, "Today, when they say (superstars) I think there is Aamir, Shah Rukh, me, and Akshay Kumar. 
We do fewer films - I do two films a year, Aamir does one film in three years, Akshay does four-five films a year. 
Salman is a huge admirer of Khiladi Kumar and said that he works more than any of the Khans in Bollywood, and therefore, he truly deserves the tag of a superstar. 
Talking about doing less films than Akshay, the Wanted actor said, "I think Akki is the only one who understood that back in the day, char-paanch lakh ke liye itni jyaada mehnat kar rahe the, ab crores ke liye utni mehnat nahi kar rahe hain.
