New Delhi, Apr 30 (PTI) A young Ramdev was so moved by the writings of Dayanand Saraswati that he quit the government school as the curriculum was a leftover of the colonial education policy, fled from home and enrolled himself in a gurukul. 
A new book "The Baba Ramdev Phenomenon: From Moksha to Market" by Kaushik Deka has these nuggets of information. 
It was a book primarily explaining the true tenets of Hinduism, making an appeal for one uniform religion based on the principles of the Vedas. 
I wanted to follow the path shown by the ancient sages," Ramdev is quoted as saying.
