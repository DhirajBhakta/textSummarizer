The Noida authority has decided to names all lanes in villages for easy identification of different pockets in each village. 
Officials said that the move is aimed at improving civic amenities in villages. 
These urban villages are located adjacent to upscale residential sectors but are yet to have basic civic amenities such as drainage, sewage network and roads, among others.?
We are working on preparing a robust municipal policy to ensure the development of civic facilities in villages on a par with urban areas. 
We cannot ignore the villages because all areas are interconnected,? 
Poor civic amenities in villages affect urban areas as well, officials said.
