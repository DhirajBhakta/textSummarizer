Lucknow, Feb 14 (PTI) The NDA government has "not waived even a single paisa" of any industrialist and Rahul Gandhi is levelling "false allegations" in this regard, Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley asserted today. 
"The Narendra Modi government has not waived even a single paisa of any industrialist till now... 
"Actually, he is levelling false allegations against the previous UPA government as most of the non-performing assets today belong to those who had been given loans by the Congress-led government," he claimed. 
To another question, Jaitley said, "Demonetisation has nothing to do with Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections... it is a part of the governments programme to clean up both economic and political systems."
