Rashid Latif has extended a hand of friendship towards Virender Sehwag after his tirade on social media created a storm in India. 
India had defeated Pakistan in their Champions Trophy opener on June 4 and there was the usual social media banter between supporters of the two teams. 
However, Pakistan came back strongly from their dismal start to first storm into the final and then defeating India, the pre-tournament favourites. 
"We lost one match badly in this year's Champions Trophy to India and India lost the final badly to Pakistan...this is a part of cricket and it happens," said Latif in a fresh video after Pakistan's remarkable vicotry.
