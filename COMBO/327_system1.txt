ENGINEERING DEFECTIONS' The Congress, which had 57 MLAs in the 182-member Assembly, has accused the BJP of using money, muscle and state power in Gujarat to engineer defections.Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi warned MLAs of the "serious consequences" of anti-defection and anti-corruption laws that could bar them from contesting elections for up to six years and lead to imprisonment of up to seven years.He recalled court judgements that termed defections a "constitutional sin" and unprincipled defections a "social evil"."
