London, Jun 11 (PTI) It seems that British Prime Minister Theresa May was not the only one who lost big in the UK polls. 
Joe Crilly, a spokesperson for the bookmaker, was quoted as saying that, "The general election result was a good one for us bookies as the Tories managed to fluff their lines in what was being billed as the unlosable election." 
"We had a number of five figure bets on the Conservatives winning a majority, with some wagers at prices as short as 1/16, although one punter from London will be breathing a sigh of relief after backing the Conservatives to win the most seats to the tune of 200,000 pounds," he said.
