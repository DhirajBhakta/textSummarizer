Actor Priyanka Chopra met Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Berlin and posted about the "lovely coincidence" on Facebook. 
She thanked the PM for taking out time from his packed schedule and meeting her but many Indians were not happy.After she posted a picture with PM Modi, social media users did what they do the best- outrage. 
They slammed Priyanka Chopra for not covering up her legs and wearing 'decent clothes'. 
Some even found her posture 'disrespectful'.Was such a lovely coincidence to be in #berlin???
