Security at Delhi airport and Metro stations has been beefed up following intelligence input that seven terrorists have managed to get army uniform worn by personnel of captain and subedar rank. 
Apart from the airport and Metro stations, personnel on election duty in Punjab have also been asked to be on alert. 
Increased security vigil at the Delhi airport has, however, put passengers at an inconvenience. 
In view of the Republic Day, we are maintaining the highest level of security and two additional layers of frisking have been added at the airport.
