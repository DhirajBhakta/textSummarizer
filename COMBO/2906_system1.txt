Sonam Kapoor and Anand Ahuja's relationship has been the talk of the town for a while now. 
It is no secret that Sonam's family is quite fond of Anand and he is often spotted on holidays with the Kapoors. 
Anil Kapoor recently talked about his relationship with his daughter's boyfriend in an interview with Pune Mirror.He said, "It is not my place to speak about Anand, that is entirely Sonam's prerogative and I have not known her to speak about her personal life. 
All I can say is that Anand and I are both private people and the bond we share is too personal for me to discuss with the media."
