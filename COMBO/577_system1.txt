By Juhi Chakraborty New Delhi, Jul 24 (PTI) Aadar Jains entry in Bollywood comes at a time when the nepotism debate has gained momentum but the newcomer says he would like people to not judge him before seeing his work. 
Aadar, the grandson of Raj Kapoor, will make his debut with "Qaidi Band" and his launch event was hosted by his cousin Ranbir Kapoor. 
The youngster says someone belonging to a film family does get an easy opportunity to meet a director or a casting director but it does not guarantee a movie as an actor can only go forward on the basis of merit.
