Dhaka, Jan 10 (PTI) Taking exception to doctors sloppy handwriting, a top Bangladeshi court has ordered them to write easy-to-read prescriptions in block letters or type them to prevent wrong medicines being issued to patients. 
The High Court asked the government to issue a circular in this regard among the countrys doctors within 30 days. 
The health secretary and Bangladesh Medical and Dental Councils registrar will have to carry out the order. 
They will also have to inform the court about their progress within six weeks, the Dhaka Tribune reported. 
The court yesterday also issued a ruling asking as to why the doctors should not be directed to mention generic names of medicines in prescriptions.
