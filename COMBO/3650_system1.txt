London, Apr 24 (PTI) Oxford University students who avoid making eye contact with their peers could be guilty of racism, according to the prestigious varsitys latest guidance. 
The universitys Equality and Diversity Unit has advised undergraduate students that "not speaking directly to people" could be deemed a "racial micro-aggression" which can lead to "mental ill-health", The Telegraph reported. 
It also claims that "jokes drawing attention to someones differences" and "not speaking directly to people" are potential forms of "everyday racism". 
The universitys Equality and Diversity Unit explains in the newsletter that "some people who do these things may be entirely well-meaning, and would be mortified to realise that they had caused offence."
