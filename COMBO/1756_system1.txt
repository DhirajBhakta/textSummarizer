The Hollywood Sign Trust, the non-profit organisation that oversees maintenance for the landmark here, is looking to improve its security after someone turned the Hollywood sign into "Hollyweed".The prank took place in the early hours of January 1 when somebody climbed the Santa Monica Mountains and changed the iconic sign to "Hollyweed". 
"The Hollywood Sign surveillance system is constantly evolving but an incident like the one that occurred early Sunday morning shows us where there are opportunities to make improvements," Chris Baumgart, chairman of the Hollywood Sign Trust, told hollywoodreporter.com."
The new year's prank was no exception and we will be deploying additional technology to tighten up surveillance and thus deter unwanted visitors in the future," said Baumgart.
