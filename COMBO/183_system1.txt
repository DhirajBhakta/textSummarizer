Akshay Kumar, whose forthcoming movie Toilet Ek Prem Katha stresses on the importance of building toilets and ending open defecation, hopes the film changes people's mindset about this "taboo topic in Indian society".Akshay said in an interaction with the media, "Talks on toilet are still taboo in India. 
I remember when I had to say a dialogue in the film which is, 'Ab biwi ghar aaye na aye, sundaas to laakar hi chhodunga is gaon mein', people were rethinking if I should say it or not. 
But as an individual, I think it is necessary... 
I mean who does not go to the toilet?"
