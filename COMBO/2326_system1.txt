The incident occurred at Badshah Khan hospital in Faridabad on Friday afternoon after the hospital administration refused to facilitate an ambulance or private vehicle.The shocking incident is a repeat of August last year in Odisha's Kalahandi, where a tribal man carried the body of his wife on his shoulder for 10 km for last rites after the district hospital's refusal for an ambulance.In Faridabad, Laxmi, the nine-year-old girl, was suffering from high fever since Thursday night. 
Around 4 am, she was gripped by high fever once again, and her parents admitted her to a private hospital.The hospital staff informed them the treatment would cost Rs 5,000-6,000.
