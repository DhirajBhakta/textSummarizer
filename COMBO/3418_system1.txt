The foreign currency notes and valuables in the black backpack worth Rs 8 lakh, forgotten by its owner in his taxi, could have taken care of everything Debendra Kapri has ever wished for. 
His father took a loan of Rs 1 lakh in 2008-09 on a 5% per month interest rate to marry off two of his daughters. 
The interest amount accumulated with every passing month and the pressure to return the money intensified, initially with warnings and later with life threats to the family members. 
With the added compound interest, the Rs 1 lakh loan increased to Rs 2 lakh within 2 years.The family sold a small piece of their land but it was not enough to pay off the loan.
