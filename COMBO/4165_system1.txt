Anupam Kher is known to have voiced his opinions on a series of issues, from the Kashmir unrest to demonetisation. 
It's a very cliched thing to call any opinion about the country a political opinion."
In fact, if an actor has an opinion, especially one that is not popular, they get trolled. 
Kher tells IndiaToday.in, in an exclusive interview, "Acting is a part of my life, it's not my life. 
I'm an individual; I'm a citizen of this country, I'm a teacher, I'm a motivational speaker, I'm a writer, I'm a son. 
Just because everyone may not agree with me, doesn't mean I'll stop putting forth what I want to say.
