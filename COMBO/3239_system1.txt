"Bowlers are pretty much second-class citizens in white-ball cricket," says former New Zealand pacer Shane Bond, who feels odds are stacked heavily against them in the limited-overs format.Writing for the International Cricket Council ahead of the upcoming Champions Trophy in England starting June 1, Bond said limited-overs cricket is "a batsman's game"."
And it isn't merely the fast bowlers, who have their task cut out. 
The change in fielding restrictions in the last 10 overs of a one-day international has eased the pressure on the bowlers a little bit, but only a little bit," he said."...but for the most part, the bowlers are pretty much second-class citizens in white-ball cricket," he added.Bond said it is this imbalance which has led to spinners using negative tactics."
That philosophy has now gone out the window," he explained.Bond said bowlers cannot do without variety in the current scenario where every alternate game ends up being a run feast."
