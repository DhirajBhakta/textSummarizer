A new train of thought from Indian Railways will help unclog the National Capital Region's trafficpacked roads and help residents breathe easy.With the launch of a roll-on-roll-off (Ro-Ro) service to carry loaded trucks on wagons from Haryana's Gurugram to Muradnagar in Uttar Pradesh, the network plans to extend the service to private vehicles jostling with daily snarls.According to the railways, about 20,000 trucks not meant for NCR enter the region daily to travel further. 
Out of the total 127 entry-exit points to the city, nine major points crisscrossing the region account for 75 per cent of the commercial light and heavy duty trucks.
