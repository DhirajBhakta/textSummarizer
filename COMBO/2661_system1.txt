Long before young Burhan Wani became the poster boy of Hizbul Mujahideen (HM), he fled from his home on 16 October 2010 and became a militant at the age of 15. 
He had reportedly decided to join the militancy due to an incident in which security personnel beat up his elder brother Khalid wani. 
Sources said that close relatives of Burhan Wani approached the top cop, asking for intervention. 
Burhan till then was not a top militant and not even in the top 10 most wanted terrorists. 
Burhan Wani? eventually became a poster boy of HM, featuring in several videos and photos posing with weapons and taunting security forces.
