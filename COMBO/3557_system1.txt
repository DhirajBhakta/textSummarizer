Karachi, Apr 30 (PTI) Bollywood superstar Salman Khans much awaited film "Tubelight" might not hit the screens on Eid in Pakistan as some local filmmakers have started a movement to stall the release of the film. 
The filmmakers along with the Film Distributors Association and the Film Producers Association want to ensure better business for Pakistani films during the Eid holidays. 
The distributors, producers and filmmakers say they want to protect the interest of Pakistani movies as two big films, "Yalghaar" and "Shor Sharaba", along with others in the pipeline, are slated for an Eid release. 
"If Tubelight also releases on Eid, it will certainly hit the business of these Pakistani films and that will not help our industry," actor Mustafa Qureshi said.
