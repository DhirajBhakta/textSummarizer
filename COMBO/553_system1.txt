We are also well into the second decade of the 21st century, a century that so many of us intuitively believe will be an Indian century, guided and shaped by India and its accomplishments. 
Nation building requires national pride:- We take pride in the soil and water of India;- We take pride in the diversity, religious harmony and inclusive ethos of India;- We take pride in the culture, heritage and spirituality of India;- We take pride in our fellow citizens;- We take pride in our work; and- We take pride in the little things we do every day.Each citizen of India is a nation builder.
