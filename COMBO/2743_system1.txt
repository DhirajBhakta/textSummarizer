The drive, however, turned out to be one filled with horror and one that made Bharti fear for his and his family's life after a large group of people he identified as Bajrang Dal activists accosted them and made Bharti chant 'Jai Shri Ram'. 
On June 28, Bharti and his family were on their way to Rahimbad, a village in Bihar's Samastipur district located around 75 kilometers north east of capital Patna. 
Bharti says he and family joined the line of trucks that had been halted by people who seemed to Bajrang Dal activists. 
"As they neared my car, I asked them what the commotion was about," Bharti says.
