s police station in Sector 51 will no longer have to witness quarrelling families, wailing parents and injured victims. 
A number of times, children themselves are the victims and in a traditional police station, they find it difficult to tell us what happened. 
Phulwari, which will also double as a cr?che for children of police personnel, has been provided a separate entry separating it from the main police station section. 
The rooms, which were once the office of a senior official, have been painted with colourful motifs and stocked with story books, art and craft material, puzzles and toys to engage children between 3 to 12 years of age. ?
