Farrukhabad (UP), Feb 16 (PTI) UP Minister Azam Khan today alleged Prime Minister Narendra Modi has failed to fulfil his poll promises, saying badshah never tells lies and if he does, he is not a badshah. 
"The Prime Minister made a false promise to people that (black) money (stashed in foreign banks) will be deposited in their bank accounts but nothing of the sort happened. 
Badshah is never a liar and if he is a liar, he is not a Badshah," he said, addressing an election rally in Jarari village under Bhojpur Assembly constituency here. 
The SP leader also alleged that after occupying the high chair, Modi is indulging in such non-serious talk which is most unbecoming for him.
