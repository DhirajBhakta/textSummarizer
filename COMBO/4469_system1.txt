Amid the controversy over an Army jawan describing the menial duties a sahayak is entrusted with by the Army officers and their families, comes the tale of a senior Army officer flying all the way from Canada to attend a wedding in his sahayak's family.For Colonel GS Ghuman, all it took was a call from his former 'buddy' - as sahayaks are known in the Army - inviting him to attend his son's wedding.Havildar Balagowda Raigowda Patil worked as the Colonel's buddy for almost two decades, before the two retired from the Army around 10 years ago."
Both were in the 25 Madras Regiment, where Patil's son, who got married recently, is posted as an Army jawan.The wedding took place at Patil's native place, around 50 kms from Belgaum.Col Ghuman also used this trip to reconnect with former jawans in his unit, and travelled to places like Mangalore, Kochi and Hyderabad to meet them and their families, before flying back to Canada.Col Ghuman's gesture comes amid reports that the Army is contemplating withdrawing combat soldiers working as sahayaks from peace stations across the country and post them back to their field formations.
