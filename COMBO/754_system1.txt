But the institute in Delhi has no room for them, literally. 
Due to space crunch, several students have been asked to stay in an adjacent building meant for associate professors. 
According to a senior IIT official, due to 30% increase in number of women students for undergraduate and masters courses, there is severe shortage of accommodation. 
Sources said a few angry parents complained to HRD minister Prakash Javadekar claiming that students were asked to sleep on the mattress spread on the floor as cots were unavailable. 
IIT officials said they have placed order for cots and 30-40 of them will be made available from Saturday.?
