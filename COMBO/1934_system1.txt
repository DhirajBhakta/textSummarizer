A meeting, called at  Lieutenant Governor Office to discuss the traffic congestion, was attended by the officials of Shahjahanabad Redevelopment Corporation (SRDC), North Delhi Municipal Corporation, PWD and Traffic Police. 
Thousands of tourists take the stretch every day to reach the historic monument. 
But due to heavy congestion and encroachment around the site they end up wasting time.During the meeting with L-G Najeeb Jung, Shahjahanabad Redevelopment Corporation (SRDC) consultant shared the plan for beautification of stretch from Daryaganj traffic signal to Lothian Bridge in Old Delhi.  ?
He directed the agencies to decongest the stretch first. 
We appreciate his timely decision as the beautification work will not survive unless the stretch is made hassle free.
