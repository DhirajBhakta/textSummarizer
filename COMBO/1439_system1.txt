With less than two days' fuel left in pollbound Manipur, the Centre deployed the mighty C-17 Globemaster, the Indian Air Force's largest military transport aircraft, to airlift 96,000 litres of fuel. 
This happened after Indian Oil Corporation made a formal "urgent" request to the IAF, requesting an airlift, from Guwahati's Borjhar Air Force station to Imphal.Official sources confirmed that since Sunday, three sorties have been made. 
An emergency measure taken to mitigate the impact of the fuel crisis triggered by the indefinite economic blockade by United Naga Council, which has been raging on for the past 84 days.While 35 tonne petroleum and diesel were sent through an Indian Airforce C-17 Globemaster plane, 70 tonne more petroleum products will be sent soon, official sources said.
