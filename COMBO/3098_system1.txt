No commitment should be open ended. 
The Afghans have to do far more, and do it far better, to justify each future year of US commitment," it said."
The United States should make it clear to Pakistan that it faces a total end to aid, and the imposition of sanctions, if it continues to support the Taliban and tolerate the Haqqani network," the report added.'
