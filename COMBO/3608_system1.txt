London, Apr 26 (PTI) Scientists have discovered what may be the worlds oldest fungus in South African rocks dating back 2.4 billion years. 
The fossils suggest that fungus may have evolved from under the deep sea rather than land. 
Drilled from rocks that were once beneath the seafloor, the fossils resemble living fungi and could push back the date for the oldest fungi by one to two billion years. 
"The deep biosphere where the fossils were found represents a significant portion of the Earth, but we know very little about its biology and even less about its evolutionary history," said Stefan Bengtson of the Swedish Museum of Natural History in Sweden who led the research team.
