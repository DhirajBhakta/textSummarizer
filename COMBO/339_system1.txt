Valerian and the City of a Thousand PlanetsDirector - Luc BessonCast - Dane DeHaan, Cara Delevingne, Clive Owen, Ethan Hawke, RihannaRating - 1/5A spectre looms over Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets. 
When everything is said and done, and Luc Besson has stubbed out his last cigarette, forced to vacate the table he has occupied for six hours at a lonely Parisian caf? where he has been smoking away his sorrows, we will know that his new film is one of those legendary box office bombs ? 
From its opening couple of scenes, when David Bowie plays over lavish shots of space, it is quite clear that Besson is attempting to recreate the success of his calling card movie, The Fifth Element, and the two Guardians of the Galaxy films.
