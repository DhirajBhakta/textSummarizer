Naam Shabana, starring Taapsee Pannu in the lead role, is a spin-off of the 2015 hit Baby. 
Here is our Naam Shabana movie review.Naam Shabana Cast: Taapsee Pannu, Akshay Kumar, Manoj Bajpayee, Anupam Kher, Prithviraj SukumaranNaam Shabana Director: Shivam NairNaam Shabana Rating:? (2.5/5)The surprise package of Baby, Taapsee Pannu, kicking some serious butt, Akshay Kumar's one-liners and lots of thrills - Naam Shabana looks full of crowd-pleasers on the surface, and if in doubt, there's always Bharat Mata Ki Jai. 
The problem is that the trailer gave it all away, which, by default, makes the first half of Naam Shabana a drag.Shabana (Taapsee) is a reserved second year B.Com student whose life revolves around Kudo training and her widowed mother.
