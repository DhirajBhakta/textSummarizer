Defending his decision to ban Rs 500 and Rs 1000 currency notes, Prime Minister Narendra Modi today said the best time to launch demonetisation is when the economy is in good shape.
?"Since the economy was in strong condition, the timing of demonetisation was the best," Modi said in Lok Sabha during his reply to the Motion of Thanks on President Pranab Mukherjee's address.
The economy was doing well and thus our decision was taken at the right time," he said."
Like Swachh Bharat, the decision on demonetisation is a movement to clean India (from corruption and black money)," Modi said today."
