An incident that resembles a Bollywood plot occurred near Vellore's Tirupattur area, where an arranged marriage was to take place. 
The marriage happened but with a twist. 
An arranged marriage was supposed to take place between a man and a 20-year-old girl from Rajapalayam on June 1 at Bala Murugan Temple at Ilayampatti.On the wedding day, when the priest asked the man to tie a thali (holy thread) around the bride's neck, the man's younger brother who was standing near him suddenly pulled out another thali kept in his shirt pocked and tied it to the bride.
