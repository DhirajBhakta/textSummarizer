There is a saying in Bengali which, roughly translated, means that someone who has had a wood apple fall on their head never goes to the orchards again. 
At one point, Mannan stooped over at a green grocer's stall to check out some cucumbers when calamity fell upon him.Only the calamity here was a calf. 
Right at the moment when Mannan chose to stop under this building and shop, this six-month-old calf managed tear off the rope it was tied with and leap off the 70-foot high terrace.The next thing Mannan knew was that "something very heavy" had fallen on him.
