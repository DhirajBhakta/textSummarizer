Up till 2000s, films with multiple heroes were, well, a norm. 
Amitabh Bachchan-Shashi Kapoor, Amitabh Bachchan-Rishi Kapoor, Akshay Kumar-Suniel Shetty, Sanjay Dutt-Govinda, among others, are some of the most well-known pairs of heroes that have consistently produced great entertainers.Today, it will be difficult to get Ranbir Kapoor, Ranveer Singh, Shahid Kapoor, etc to star together in a film. 
Films like Rangoon (Shahid-Saif), Padmavati (Shahid-Ranveer) and Gunday (Ranveer-Arjun) are some recent exceptions.But till now, we have not seen two big contemporary stars at the prime of their careers, coming together to do a film. 
Well that might change soon with Hrithik Roshan and Akshay Kumar apparently coming together to star in a film.MOVIE REVIEW: JOLLY LLB 2MOVIE REVIEW: KAABILA source, quoted by DNA, said, "They have found a great script which is perfect and they (Hrithik and Akshay) both have lead roles."
