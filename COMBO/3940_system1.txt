Despite protests by China, the 14th Dalai Lama today arrived in Arunachal Pradesh but will skip the famous Tawang monastery due to bad weather.The visit is opposed by China which considers Arunachal Pradesh to be a part of southernmost Tibet.His Holiness was greeted by chanting of prayers, music and religious flags with hymns and praises written on them. 
The crowd swelled despite bad weather and the wait did not deter the followers of the Tibetan spiritual leader from standing for hours.Dalai Lama was to reach Tawang in morning but the plans were changed due to extremely turbulent weather in neighbouring Assam.
