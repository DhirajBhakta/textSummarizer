BJP legislator Radharani Panda today alleged in the Odisha Assembly that a woman was asked to remove her black innerwear before being allowed to enter the venue of Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik's meeting at Bargarh district. 
Panda's allegation created ripples in the House after she was given an opportunity to speak on the issue of security personnel asking girls and women to remove black odhani (stole) before allowing them to attend a government programme attended by the chief minister in Sundergarh district on December 4.
