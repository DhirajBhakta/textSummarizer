West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee today reacted sharply to Bollywood actor Kajol's controversy where the actor reportedly clarified what meat she had eaten recently.Speaking at a public rally in North Dinajpur district, Mamata said the actor had come up with the clarification out of fear. 
The Trinamool Congress supremo's comment comes after the actor tweeted a clarification that a video that she had earlier shared on social media was not of beef but "legal" buffalo meat."
However, soon after the post, social media went abuzz with many questioning her given husband and actor Ajay Devgn had campaigned for the BJP, which seeks beef ban across the country.The Bengal chief minister's outcry on the matter is not new.
