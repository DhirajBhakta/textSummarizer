Mumbai, Feb 9 (PTI) Hitachi Payments Services today accepted its systems were compromised by a sophisticated malware in mid-2016, that led to one of the biggest cyber security breaches in country with 3.2 million cards affected and a scare over security of card-based transactions. 
The company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Japanese Hitachi, made the acknowledgement following the receipt of final assessment report from payments and information security audit firm SISA Information Security, and said it "regrets" the inconvenience caused. 
"We confirm that our security systems had a breach during mid-2016," its Managing Director Loney Anthony said, adding this happened despite following adequate security measures and adopting the standards of internationally- accepted best practices.
