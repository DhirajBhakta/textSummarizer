The controverisal Finance Bill of 2017, that was introduced by Finance Minister Arun Jaitely as a Money Bill in the Lok Sabha, and gotten it passed with the majority the Bharatiya Janata Party enjoys in the lower house, was reintroduced today after the Rajya Sabha recommended five amendments to it. 
As predicted by experts, the Lok Sabha rejected the amendments suggested by the upper house and passed the bill in its original form.?? The Lok Sabha introduced by Jaitley was strongly opposed by the opposition parties of RSP, TMC and BJD. 
The Opposition has termed the introduction of the amendments as "back-door" legislating and taking away right of Parliament to frame laws.Jaitley defended the amendments with the argument that they were all "incidental provisions" to the Finance Bill.
