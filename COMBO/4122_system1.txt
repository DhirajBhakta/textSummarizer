The film that Shahid and Kangana starred in and which was the beginning of all the drama, Rangoon, has sunk into oblivion. 
But trust the actors to not let sleeping dogs lie.After repeated jibes from Kangana regarding his 'mood swings' and behaviour on the sets of Rangoon, now Shahid Kapoor has spoken out about it all.In an interview with Filmfare, when Shahid was asked about Kangana saying that it was difficult to kiss him with his thick moustache in Rangoon, the Kaminey actor said, "Kangana has a thing for one-liners.
