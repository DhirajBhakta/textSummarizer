s 14th president on Tuesday. 
Kovind, 71, was born in a poor family in Paraunkh village in rural Kanpur. 
My election as President of India is to represent all such Kovinds toiling away to make a living,? 
If at all Kovind represents any section, it is that of the majority of India--rural, agrarian, economically and socially underprivileged. 
It is the same section that Prime Minister Narendra Modi represents. 
But both Kovind and Modi represent the true India - Marx?
s social base in the state after Yogi Adityanath, a Rajput, was made the chief minister. 
President elect Ram Nath Kovind greets people during a ceremony after his election, in Delhi on July 20.
