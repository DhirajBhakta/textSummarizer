Russia is hoping to embrace India's EVM technology for its upcoming presidential election, even as Indian politicians themselves continue to debate their efficiency.Russia hopes to learn from "India's experience" of conducting polls through EVMs, ahead of the 2018 presidential election, according to a report in The Economic Times.The report says, Nikolai Levichev, Deputy Chairman of the Russia's Election Commission, visited Uttarakhand this year during February's Assembly polls to observe and understand the process of voting through EVMs. 
He also monitored elections in Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Manipur and Goa and was reportedly impressed with the EVM system as it reduced the role of people in the poll process.Levichev also held "wide-ranging consultations" with senior officials in Delhi to learn more about EVM technology and understand its best practices.Russia's interest in EVMs comes at a time when India's Opposition leaders have expressed grave concerns regarding EVM tampering.In a press conference held just yesterday, Aam Aadmi Party's Arvind Kejriwal had alleged tampering on a "massive scale" in Madhya Pradesh's Bhind.
