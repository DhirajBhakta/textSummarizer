A day after the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) polls threw up a hung verdict, Shiv Sena's tally of corporators rose to 87 today with three party rebels who won as Independent nominees returning to its fold. 
This gave a slight push to Uddhav Thackeray's efforts to cobble up numbers but reaching the magic figure of 114 seats needed to rule the cash-rich civic body is still a far cry. 
The development came at a time when both the Sena and its estranged ally BJP which has won 82 seats, are keeping cards close to their chest on the prospects of coming together again to attain power or otherwise.
