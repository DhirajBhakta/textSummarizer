New Delhi, Feb 21 (PTI) India needs to "celebrate" success stories of "heroes" like Dhirubhai Ambani and NR Narayana Murthy who have created wealth for the country and jobs for millions, former Infosys executive TV Mohandas Pai said today. 
"We have to create a good narrative for India. 
Our narrative is broken up into very negative matters about this country," he said. 
There are success stories across sectors such as pharmaceuticals, IT and telecom, he said, pointing out that of the top 10 software companies globally, five are Indian. 
There are so many success stories in India," Pai said addressing an AIMA event.
