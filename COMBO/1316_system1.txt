Former Australian middle-order stalwart Michael Hussey has urged Steven Smith's men to not try and rile India captain Virat Kohli in the four-Test series which starts this month. 
(Watch what Kohli and Dhoni did to Chahal after his 6 for 25)Smith suggested in an interview in December that his team would want Kohli a little angry. 
The young Aussie captain felt distracting his India counterpart would be advantageous for him.

However, Hussey, who has been involved in some fabled India-Australia battles, said firing Kohli up would be a wrong idea.
