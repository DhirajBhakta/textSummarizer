The Indian Army, after consultations with the Defence Ministry, is considering cutting down the number of its sahayaks by 10,000, reported India Today. This comes after videos of soldiers alleging that they were often made to perform menial tasks for the officers surfaced online. The sahayak jawans will be moved to army formations and replaced by civilians.
