The search and rescue operations launched after a bridge collapsed in South Goa on Thursday night have been halted by the presence of crocodiles in the river. 
"An aerial inspection is being done. 
Till now close to 15 people are missing," South Goa collector Swapnil Naik said. 
Notably, two dead bodies have been recovered so far.
