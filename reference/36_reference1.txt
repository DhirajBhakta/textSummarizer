A woman lawmaker of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party, Ayesha Gulalai, has accused party leader Imran Khan of harassing women leaders in the party and sending them obscene text messages. 
"My integrity matters to me the most and I cannot compromise when it comes to my honour and dignity," Gulalai said announcing her resignation from the party.
