During his meeting with BJP MPs, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday asked them to use social media to its maximum potential to popularise the government's social welfare schemes. 
PM Modi further asked them to keep in touch with their respective constituencies, and not let the people feel that they don't meet their elected representative.
