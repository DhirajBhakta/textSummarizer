Citing the escalated standoff at Doklam, Chinese media on Tuesday stated that if India stirs up conflicts at Line of Actual Control (LAC), it should be ready to face consequences of "all-out confrontation". 
The media asserted that India is concerned with China's rapid economic growth and blamed the former for provoking border conflicts as means of sounding out China.
