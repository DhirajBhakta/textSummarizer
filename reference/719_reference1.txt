The Mora coastal police in Mumbai have stopped their daily patrolling of Elephanta Island after passenger boat services from Mora were terminated due to heavy rains. 
Residents have complained that the local police is not taking the required measures for their security. 
The island has a population of around 2,000 people and is visited by 3,000- 4,000 tourists every day.
