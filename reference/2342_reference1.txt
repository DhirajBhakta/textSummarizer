Two Delhi Police constables were shot at while trying to stop an ATM theft by five men in Delhi's Pandav Nagar on Friday. 
After spotting the policemen, the three men outside alerted two of their aides inside the ATM and opened fire to scare the constables away, but no bullets hit them. 
The men managed to escape, but without money.
