The government has directed all colleges and universities to stop accepting students' fees in cash and resort to digital modes from the next academic session. 
In an HRD Ministry directive, colleges were told to pay vendors, salaries and wages only through online or digital modes. 
Campus canteens were "encouraged" to use the government's BHIM payments app for all transactions.
