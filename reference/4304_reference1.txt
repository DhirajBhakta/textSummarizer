Erstwhile Congress leader Jagdambika Pal, who is currently a BJP MP, once served as the Uttar Pradesh CM for barely 48 hours from February 21 to February 23, 1998. This happened amid the Ayodhya crisis and reservation issue in the state during 1989-2007. The state saw as many as 10 CMs and three phases of President's Rule during this period.
