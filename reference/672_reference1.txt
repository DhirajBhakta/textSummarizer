The Women and Child Development Ministry has proposed that it should be compulsory for both boys and girls to study home science and physical education in school, in order to promote gender sensitivity. 
The ministry reportedly made several other recommendations aimed at redefining gender roles starting at a young age and creating new employment opportunities for women.
