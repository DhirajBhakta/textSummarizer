A wildfire on Sunday broke out in the US state of Oklahoma, burning around 600 acres of land and forcing the evacuation of hundreds of people in nearby areas and parts of the adjoining state of Texas. 
With no injuries reported, the state is under a national fire advisory through February 14 because of high risks for wildfires.
