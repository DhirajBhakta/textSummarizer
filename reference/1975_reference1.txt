German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Tuesday said she believed the attack at Christmas market in Berlin which killed 12 people was a "terrorist attack" and it was "hard to bear" that the suspected attacker was an asylum seeker. 
Merkel visited the scene of the attack and said this was "particularly repugnant" because Germans are "dedicated" to helping refugees.
