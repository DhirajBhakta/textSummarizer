A West Bengal court on Saturday pronounced death sentence to three Lashkar-e-Taiba operatives on charges of sedition. In 2007, four LeT operatives were arrested from the Indo-Bangladesh border for infiltrating into India. While one of the four men fled from CID custody in 2013, rest three were charged under Section 121 IPC for waging a war against India.
