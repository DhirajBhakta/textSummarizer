The police arrested two Kerala men near Goa's capital Panaji on Monday for distributing pamphlets that allegedly contained the Islamic State symbol and a message titled "ISIS Shaitan". 
The pamphlets, in Kannada language, were about a convention of Salafi Muslims to be held in Mangalore (Karnataka) in January. 
The arrested persons have been identified as Ilyas and Abdul Nazir.
