A 58-year-old Indian man who was detained by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) recently for not possessing necessary immigration documents while entering the country died in custody at an Atlanta hospital. Claiming that fatalities in its custody are "exceedingly rare", the ICE added that he was the eighth individual who died in its custody in the fiscal year 2017.
