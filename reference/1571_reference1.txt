A Middle East Airlines flight from Beirut to London was forced to make an emergency landing in Istanbul after a fistfight broke out on the plane. 
The fight took place after an air hostess was assaulted. 
The man who had punched the air hostess following an argument with his wife was   taken away by four security guards after the landing.
