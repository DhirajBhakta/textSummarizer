White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci has been removed from his job within the first 10 days of his appointment. 
This comes after Scaramucci, a Harvard law graduate and former Wall Street financier, launched a foul-mouthed tirade against two of his senior colleagues at the White House last week. 
"The president felt his comments were inappropriate," Trump's spokeswoman said.
