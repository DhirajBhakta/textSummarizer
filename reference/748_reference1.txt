Delhi Metro's non-executive staff on Friday staged a protest for increase in salary by sitting on various platforms with black bands around their arms. 
They reportedly threatened a "total shutdown" of services from Monday if their demands are not met. 
Protestors said that they were assured of increased grade pay in 2015, but nothing has been done so far.
