Dai Bingguo, China's retired negotiator on the border talks, has said that if India agreed to make concessions in the eastern sector, China would also make concessions in Aksai Chin. 
Notably, while India sees China as occupying 38,000 sq km of its territory in Aksai Chin, China claims 90,000 sq km in Arunachal Pradesh.
