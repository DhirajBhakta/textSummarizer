Delhi authorities have postponed the demolition of a temple allegedly built illegally in east Delhi's Shahdara. 
The Delhi High Court had ordered the demolition for Tuesday, but the Public Works Department said it was postponed to August due to 'administrative reasons'. 
This comes after a religious group warned of protests if the temple is demolished, reports said.
