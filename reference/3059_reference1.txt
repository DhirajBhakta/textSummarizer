Sonia Prajapati, a 25-year-old Delhi woman has claimed that she gave birth to a boy on June 2 at Delhi's Safdarjung Hospital but the central government-run institute handed her a baby girl. 
The couple is now waiting for the report of a DNA test to confirm the identity of the baby. 
The hospital, however, denied any mistake.
