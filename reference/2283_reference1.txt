Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Saturday came face to face with his namesake as he met the baby of Syrian refugees who was named in his honour. 
The two-month-old Justin Trudeau Adam Bilan was seen sleeping as the Prime Minister held him. 
The boy's parents named him as a gesture of thanks to the country that offered them refuge.
