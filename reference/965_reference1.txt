The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has ordered 70 buildings in Mumbai to reduce their height within 60 days. This comes after the buildings in Vile Parle, Santacruz and Ghatkopar were classified as 'obstacles' in flight paths. The DGCA initiated action after a Bombay High Court order took serious note of violations of height norms by private developers.
