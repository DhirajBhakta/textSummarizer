The central government has approved the renaming of two villages in Haryana, after complaints from villagers. 
The Ganda village has been renamed to Ajit Nagar and Kinnar has been renamed to Gaibi Nagar. 
A teenage girl from Ganda had written to PM Narendra Modi, saying that the villagers were embarrassed to use the village name, which means 'dirty' in English.
