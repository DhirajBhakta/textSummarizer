Jharkhand Police on Monday arrested a 25-year-old man for allegedly abusing Prime Minister Narendra Modi and cows in a WhatsApp video. "The content in the video was explicitly provocative. Any person found spreading communally sensitive content in social media will not be spared," police officials said. Eleven such people have been jailed in Hazaribag district alone this year, they added.
