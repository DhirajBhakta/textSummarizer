An Asian-origin teacher is suing United Airlines for being forced to hold her two-year-old son on her lap during a three-and-a-half-hour flight after paying nearly $1,000 (65,000) for his seat. United gave the seat to a standby passenger, and reportedly did not apologise until five days later. The airline requires children aged over two to have their own seats.
