One of Israel's leading newspapers described Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi as "the most important PM of the world" ahead of his visit to the country. Israelis had huge expectations from US President Donald Trump's visit, but "he didn't say much", the newspaper said. It added that Modi, the leader of 1.25 billion people, deserves a lot of attention.
