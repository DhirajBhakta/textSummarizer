Sulkhan Singh, the 1980-batch Indian Police Service officer, on Saturday, took charge as the new Director General of Police of Uttar Pradesh. Singh has replaced outgoing Uttar Pradesh Police chief Javeed Ahmed. "I assure people our police will treat all equally. Vacant posts will be filled soon," Singh said. Even criminals from ruling party will not be spared, he added.
