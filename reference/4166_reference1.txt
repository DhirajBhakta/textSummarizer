Passport colours are derived from four primary colours- red, green, blue or black, according to Arton Group, which runs a passport database. Blue passports are believed to belong to 'new-world' nations including India and Australia. Red passports usually belong to nations with a communist history. Additionally, black passports, used by New Zealand among others, are known to be the rarest.
