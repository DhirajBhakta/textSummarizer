Landlocked Manipur was cut off from the rest of India after Barak bridge, also known as the second lifeline of the border state, collapsed on Monday morning. 
A transport department official said that the bridge collapsed when a 10-wheeler goods-laden truck was passing through it. 
The collapse has left around 200 goods-laden trucks en route to Imphal stranded.
