Days after Delhi University's Ramjas College saw violent clashes, a Lady Shri Ram College student who is a Kargil martyr's daughter has initiated a social media campaign #StudentsAgainstABVP. 
She held a placard that read, "I am a student from Delhi University. 
I am not afraid of ABVP. 
I am not alone. 
Every student of India is with me. 
#StudentsAgainstABVP".
