India's tallest Tricolour, which is 360-feet tall, has not been hoisted at the Indo-Pakistan border for the last three months.The flag, which is visible from Pakistan, was taken down in April by the Amritsar administration after it was repeatedly damaged by high-velocity winds. 
Every time the flag is brought down, it brings 'embarrassment' to all, officials maintaining the flag said.
