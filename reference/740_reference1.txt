The National Green Tribunal (NGT) on Friday directed the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) to submit an action plan for the restoration of Yamuna floodplains. 
This comes after an expert committee appointed by the NGT claimed that the ecology of over 420 acres of floodplains was adversely affected by the World Culture Festival organised in 2016 by the Art of Living.
