The Saudi-led coalition in Yemen is blocking deliveries of jet fuel to UN planes bringing humanitarian aid to the rebel-held capital Sanaa, UN officials said. 
Aid efforts were also hampered by delays and refusals of visas by the Yemeni government, officials added. 
The Saudi-led coalition has been involved in Yemen's civil war backing the Yemeni government against the Houthi rebels.
