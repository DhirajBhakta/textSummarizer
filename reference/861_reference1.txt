The Maharashtra government is planning to invite global tenders for purchasing a chopper for the VIPs of the state. It comes after the CM had survived a chopper crash in May, following which, private agencies were suspended from flying VIPs of the state. A government official said that the chopper is likely to be a modern Sikorsky S76 or Bell.
