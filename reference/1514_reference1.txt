Two girls seen in the controversial kiss and run 'prank' video, which was uploaded on YouTube channel 'Crazy Sumit', have said that the YouTuber is their friend. 
However, they said that they were unaware that the video would be uploaded on the internet for monetary gain, contrary to Sumit's claims. 
Following the contradictions, the police would now grill Sumit again.
