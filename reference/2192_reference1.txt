Donald Trump's six-month approval rating stands at 36%, the lowest among all US Presidents in the last 70 years, according to a national poll published on Sunday. 
The poll found that 48% of US citizens believe that the country's leadership in the world is weaker than before the billionaire took office. 
However, Trump called the poll result "not bad".
