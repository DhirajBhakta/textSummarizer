An unaccompanied 15-year-old boy was removed from an overbooked easyJet flight and left alone at a departure gate at London Gatwick Airport on Thursday. 
The child, Casper Read, was asked to leave after another passenger claimed his seat. 
EasyJet said the incident will be investigated, adding, "easyJet has a procedure to protect unaccompanied minors but unfortunately this was not followed."
