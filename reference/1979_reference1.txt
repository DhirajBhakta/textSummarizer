A glass ceiling near Entry Gate 4 at the Chennai Airport fell off for the 74th time this year, according to reports. 
Notably, the National Human Rights Commission had in April issued notices to the Ministry of Civil Aviation in this regard. 
The Civil Aviation Ministry has reportedly investigated the airport and asked the authorities to take corrective steps.
