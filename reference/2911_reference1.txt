Bengaluru firm IDC Technologies that had said "we are not responsible for women's safety after they log out" has agreed to provide cab service to female employees working on the night shift. 
This comes after a female employee from the firm met IT Minister Priyank Kharge to bring up the matter, and the minister assured action after formal complaint.
