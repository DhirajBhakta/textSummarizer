The Delhi High Court has directed the CBSE to continue with its moderation policy of giving students grace marks for difficult questions. 
The court ruled this following a petition which challenged that the change in policy will affect students' admissions abroad. 
The court asked CBSE to continue the policy as it was in place when the examination forms were submitted.
