A woman has sued Airbnb for negligence for allowing her to rent a Los Angeles room from a host previously accused of domestic violence. 
Leslie Lapayowker alleged Carlos Del Olmo, listed as a "superhost" for positive reviews, sexually assaulted her. 
Airbnb said it had conducted a background check but allowed Del Olmo to be a host because he wasn't convicted.
