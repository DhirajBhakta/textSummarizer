Amid the ongoing protests over the ban on the bull-taming sport, Jallikattu, in Tamil Nadu, DMK on Thursday called for a statewide 'rail roko' agitation on Friday. This comes after PETA said it may take the legal route if the Centre brings an ordinance to allow conducting Jallikattu. Our campaign is against cruelty towards all animals, PETA added.
