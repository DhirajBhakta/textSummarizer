An ex-official of Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) and a retired Lieutenant General, Amjad Shoaib has admitted that former Indian Navy officer Kulbhushan Jadhav was captured in Iran. 
Notably, Pakistan has been arguing that Jadhav was arrested in the country's restive Balochistan province last year. 
However, India claims that he was captured in Iran, where he went for business purposes.
