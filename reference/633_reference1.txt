Farmers' organisations in Maharashtra will reportedly hold 'rasta roko' (blockade) on August 14 to restart their protests to demand farm loan waiver. 
This comes after the farmers' groups held a march in Pune to spread awareness about the alleged injustices to farmers. 
They also demanded that farmers be paid 50% minimum support price apart from input costs.
