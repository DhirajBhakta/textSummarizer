The Maharashtra government reportedly plans to launch a mobile app which can be used by farmers to fill loan waiver forms. The app will have a two-page form in which farmers will have to put their personal details including name, PAN card number, and Aadhaar number. Farmers benefiting from last month's loan waiver are expected to fill the forms.
