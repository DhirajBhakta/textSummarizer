The Lord Venkateswara Temple in Tirupati has made Aadhaar cards mandatory for availing 'privileged special entry darshan' and free laddus. Those without an Aadhaar card can, however, submit any other authorised identity card midway on the 10-km-long stairway to the shrine. The devotees not submitting an identity proof can visit the shrine, but without a privileged entry.
