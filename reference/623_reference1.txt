The Mumbai police on Saturday arrested a 39-year-old man for allegedly flashing at a woman in Churchgate. 
The 30-year-old woman raised an alarm when he allegedly overtook and flashed at her. 
The man was granted bail after he reportedly said that he was only fixing the zip of his trousers. 
The police said it could be a case of misinterpretation.
