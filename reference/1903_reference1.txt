Sand artist Sudarsan Pattnaik created 1,000 Santa Claus sculptures at the Puri beach in Odisha on Christmas eve. 
The installation was constructed with the help of 35 students and about 1,000 tons of sand in four days. 
With the sand art, Sudarsan broke his 2012 Limca Book record of 500 sand Santa Claus sculptures.
