The Goods and Services Tax (GST) was first proposed 17 years ago, when the then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee formed a GST committee. 
A proposed model was first placed during 2006 Budget speech, and the then Finance Minister P Chidambaram announced in 2010 that GST will be implemented from April 2011. 
It finally got President's approval in September 2016.
