Nearly 30,000 students from 51 Delhi schools participated in New Delhi Municipal Council's (NDMC) green drive and planted saplings on their school premises and surrounding areas. 
Asserting that a green drive cannot be successful unless it is a people's movement, NDMC Chairman Naresh Kumar said, "The idea is to systematically engage each and every stakeholder."
