Two teenagers aged 15 and 16 were arrested over a series of five acid attacks that took place in less than 90 minutes in London on Thursday. Calling the incidents "completely barbaric", police officials said the attacks were carried out by two male suspects on a moped. The attackers stole the moped from one of the victims, police officials added.
