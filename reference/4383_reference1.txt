After Tamil Nadu CM Edappadi K Palaniswami requested the Centre to intervene in the issue of release of Indian fishermen, Sri Lanka on Friday arrested eight Indian fishermen from Pudukkottai. 
While seven of these fishermen are being held in Trincomalee in Sri Lanka, one fisherman attempted suicide soon after being taken into custody and was admitted to the Trincomalee hospital.
