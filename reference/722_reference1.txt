The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation's (BMC) Andheri (East) ward office is hosting over 40 waste management companies to raise awareness among residents and school students about waste management. 
This comes after the BMC sent around 4,000 notices to housing societies and other institutions in the area for failing to segregate waste.
