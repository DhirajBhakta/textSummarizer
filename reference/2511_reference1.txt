A Mumbai woman, who was allegedly laughed off by authorities for complaining about a man masturbating at her in a local train, has shared the incident's video. 
In the video, she captured the accused, Ashok Pradhan, masturbating while looking at her. 
The video also shows a constable, who came to the compartment with her, asking her to sit elsewhere.
