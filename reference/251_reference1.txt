A man set himself on fire in Sydney protesting against the Australian Immigration Department on Friday, reports said. Adding that the police negotiated with the man for 8-10 minutes before he set himself alight, officials said the man was "deeply disturbed and upset". He "would have killed himself" if police had not doused him with a fire extinguisher, they added.
