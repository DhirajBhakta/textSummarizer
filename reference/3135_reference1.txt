For the first time, Pakistan's Sindh government has recruited 46 women in the police's counter-terror department for combat operations and intelligence gathering, according to reports. 
The women who have been selected after various tests, interviews, and medical examinations will be trained for six months by the country's Army. 
Notably, less than 2% of Pakistani police officers are women.
