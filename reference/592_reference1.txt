Delhi Police have been using Bollywood-inspired memes to spread awareness about social issues on Twitter. 
"Memes are helpful in establishing a connect with young people and they also popularise our on-ground campaigns to counter drug addiction, ragging and cyber crimes," police said. 
Hashtags like #Drugskadanda, #Drugskapanchnama and #Jabwearrest were also used in the campaign.
