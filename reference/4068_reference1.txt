Addressing the 30th edition of his monthly radio address 'Mann Ki Baat', Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday asserted that depression needed expression and not suppression. 
"We are fortunate to have been raised in joint families, it ends any chance of...depression," he said. 
PM Modi also said it is good to share your feelings with others if feeling depressed.
