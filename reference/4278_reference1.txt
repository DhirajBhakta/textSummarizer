Indian National Congress could manage to win only two of the ten Assembly seats in Amethi and Raebareli parliamentary constituencies, considered strongholds of the Gandhi family. 
Six of the Assembly seats went to Bharatiya Janata Party while Samajwadi Party won the remaining two. 
It was a complete washout for the Congress in Rahul Gandhi's Amethi Lok Sabha constituency.
