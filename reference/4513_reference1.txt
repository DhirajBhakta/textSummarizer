At least 400 languages or more than half languages spoken by India's 1.3 billion people may die out in next 50 years, a study by the People's Linguistic Survey of India (PSLI) stated. 
Further claiming that India has already lost 250 languages in last five decades, the survey said, "Each time a language is lost, the corresponding culture is killed."
