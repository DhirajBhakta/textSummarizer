A Delhi man murdered his 22-year-old pregnant wife on Saturday as she could not make perfectly round rotis. 
The couple had reportedly got into a fight during which he kicked her in the stomach and later strangled her to death. 
"My mother was a good cook but the chapati shape angered my father," the couple's four-year-old daughter told the police.
