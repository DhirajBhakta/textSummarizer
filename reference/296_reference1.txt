Body parts have been found on Mont Blanc in the French Alps that might belong to passengers killed in one of the two Air India plane crashes over 50 years ago. 
Daniel Roche, who spent years combing glaciers looking for remains, found a hand and part of a leg. 
Roche also found one jet engine of 1966 Air India flight.
