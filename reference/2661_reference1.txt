A Home Ministry official has revealed that the family of terror group Hizbul Mujahideen's slain commander Burhan Wani wanted him to surrender. 
Wani's relatives sought police intervention in 2013 after he left his home in 2010 and joined militancy at the age of 15. 
Wani was killed in an encounter with security forces on July 8 last year.
