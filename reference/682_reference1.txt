Musician Wuilly Arteaga, who became the face of anti-government protests in Venezuela, has promised to "be back in the streets" after he was injured in clashes on Saturday. 
Arteaga gained popularity for playing the national anthem and other tunes on his violin during the protests. 
"Neither rubber bullets nor pellets will stop our fight for Venezuela's independence," Arteaga said.
