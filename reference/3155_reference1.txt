India on Friday successfully test-fired its indigenously developed nuclear-capable Prithvi-II missile from the Integrated Test Range in Odisha as part of a user trial by the Indian armed forces. 
The surface-to-surface medium-range ballistic missile, which was inducted into Indian armed forces in 2003, is capable of carrying 500-1,000 kg of warheads and is thrust by liquid propulsion twin engines.
