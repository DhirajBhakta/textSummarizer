A 38-year-old serial rapist accused of raping hundreds of minors for over 12 years was arrested on Saturday, police said. 
It is alleged the superstitious rapist travelled from Uttar Pradesh to Delhi by only the Sampark Kranti Express, travelled only on odd dates and wore the same set of clothes - red jacket and blue jeans - while abusing girls.
