The North Delhi Municipal Corporation has said that the Ring Road and Aurobindo Marg near AIIMS and Safdarjung Hospitals will be declared a no-hawker zone. The move is aimed at streamlining traffic movement outside the hospitals so that patients, doctors, and ambulances coming to the medical institutes get easier access and other commuters do not face any hassle.
