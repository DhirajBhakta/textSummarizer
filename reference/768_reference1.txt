The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) has said that the Indian Army's stock of 61 types of critical ammunition will last only for ten days of war. The stocks of just 20% of the armoury were found to be satisfactory. Notably, the Indian Army is required to hold ammunition enough to fight a short intense war of 20 days.
