Tibetan religious leader Dalai Lama on Tuesday said the global terrorist crisis is fast reaching the nuclear threshold. 
Once it crosses the threshold, it could mean that the entire mankind could perish, he added. 
Dalai Lama also said that the terrorism crisis cannot be resolved unless all the nations come together on a single platform against it.
