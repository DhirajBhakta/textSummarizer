Union Minister Babul Supriyo on Monday said the underwater tunnel of East-West Metro Corridor Project in Kolkata, built below the Ganga river bed, is the first of its kind in the country. 
"Building a tunnel under the river had never taken place elsewhere in India. 
Further being built under Ganga, it has an emotional value as well," he added.
