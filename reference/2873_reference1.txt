A Karnataka man was forced to carry his mother injured in a hit-and-run case to a hospital on foot after failing to get an ambulance and help in time. 
Reportedly, the ambulance arrived one hour after the accident. 
The woman was given first aid at a government hospital and was referred to a private hospital, but died on the way.
