BJP MP from Barabanki Priyanka Rawat tossed a plastic water bottle into Saryu during an inspection of an embankment on the river. 
Rawat was accompanied by UP Water Resources Minister Dharampal Singh, who, incidentally, gave a speech on how to keep rivers clean. 
Singh and Rawat had travelled more than 100 kilometres to Gonda from Lucknow for the embankment inspection.
