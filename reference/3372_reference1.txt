The White House has ruled out the appointment of a special prosecutor to investigate the allegations of Russian interference in last year's presidential elections. 
The White House also issued a timeline detailing how Trump lost confidence in Comey over the last months. 
Interestingly, Trump recently tweeted that Comey would be replaced by someone who will do a far better job.
