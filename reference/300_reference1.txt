Mumbai Congress chief Sanjay Nirupam on Saturday said that Congress workers will 'gherao' the Mumbai University on August 2, if it doesn't declare the results by July 31. 
According to Congress, over 20 lakh answer sheets are yet to be checked. 
Nirupam alleged that the online-assessment firm got the contract with MU without proper tendering process due to BJP's support.
