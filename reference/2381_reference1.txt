An 18-year-old ragpicker Bilal Dar has been appointed as Srinagar's civic ambassador. The SMC commissioner said Bilal, who earned his living by picking up waste from Wular Lake for almost five years, is an inspiration for everybody. Dar will get a special uniform and vehicle to go and meet people and sensitise them about environmental issues, cleanliness and garbage disposal.
