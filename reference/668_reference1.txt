Tomatoes are reportedly being protected by armed guards in Indore after prices soared due to a shortage. 
Farmers in Madhya Pradesh had dumped tomatoes on the roads earlier this year after a bumper production brought its price down, which then led to the shortage. 
Marketplace officials reportedly appointed six armed guards for protecting tomatoes after receiving requests from businessmen.
