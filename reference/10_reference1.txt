India's food regulator Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) is planning to create a network to collect leftover food and provide it to the needy. It is looking to connect with organisations which can collect, store and distribute leftover food from weddings and large parties. It further added that all food must meet the safety and hygiene standards.
