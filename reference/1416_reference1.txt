North Korea's former deputy ambassador to London, Thae Yong-ho, who defected to South Korea last year has said that the country's elite are turning against Kim Jong-un. 
"When Kim Jong-un first came to power, I was hopeful that he would make reasonable and rational decisions...but I soon fell into despair watching him purging officials for no proper reasons," he added.
