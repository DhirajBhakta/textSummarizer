In a bid to ensure punctuality, Delhi's Chief Secretary MM Kutty has asked all officers working in the Delhi secretariat to report to work by 9:45 am. 
This comes after Kutty noticed that many officers were coming late to their offices. 
The newly appointed chief secretary has instructed secretaries of every department to take strict action against habitual late-comers.
