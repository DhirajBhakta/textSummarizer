The government has said that India has less than 1 doctor for every 1,000 people, which is less than the World Health Organisation standard. Around 8.18 lakh doctors may be available for active service, giving a doctor-population ratio of 0.62:1000, the Minister of State for Health Anupriya Patel said. The WHO prescribes a ratio of 1:1000.
