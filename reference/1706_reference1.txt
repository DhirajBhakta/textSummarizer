According to a recent European study, diesel cars are 10 times more toxic than diesel trucks and buses due to stricter European Union testing standards applied to larger vehicles. 
Nitrogen oxide emissions per kilometre for diesel cars were found to be double that of heavy-duty vehicles. 
Diesel cars emit about six times more toxic gases than allowed, the study claimed.
