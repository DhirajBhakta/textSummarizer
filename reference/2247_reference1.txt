The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) is planning to conduct the class 10 and class 12 Board exams on the same dates, in different shifts. 
According to the plan, class 12 exams will be held in the morning and class 10 in the afternoon. 
This would reduce duration of exams and give teachers extra time for checking the papers.
