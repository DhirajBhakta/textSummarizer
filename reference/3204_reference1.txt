While talking about the human shield controversy, Indian Army Chief General Bipin Rawat said on Sunday, soldiers need "innovative ways" to fight the "dirty war" in Kashmir. 
He said, if people are throwing stones, he cannot tell his men to "just wait and die". 
"I would have been happy if the protesters were firing weapons...instead of throwing stones," he added.
