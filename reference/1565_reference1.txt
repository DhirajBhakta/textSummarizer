US President Barack Obama has declared January 16 as Religious Freedom Day in accordance with a yearly tradition. 
Urging his countrymen to stand against religious intolerance, Obama said, "religious freedom is a principle based not on shared ancestry, culture, ethnicity, or faith but on a shared commitment to liberty." 
He further said that America's strength comes from its diversity.
