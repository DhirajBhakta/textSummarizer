The Congress on Monday took a U-turn on party Vice President Rahul Gandhi's meeting with the Chinese ambassador to India, Luo Zhaohui, on July 8 in Delhi amid the ongoing China-India border standoff. 
While the Congress had earlier termed the reports of Gandhi meeting Zhaohui as "fake news", the political party later acknowledged that the "courtesy meeting" did take place.
