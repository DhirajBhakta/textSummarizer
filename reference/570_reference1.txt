Drug peddlers are coating biscuits and nut crackers with Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) drug to avoid being caught at airports, Task Force officials said. 
"These biscuits were detected and seized only because the peddlers were carrying another drug, which was detected in the scanning machine," an officer said. 
This was revealed after Task Force arrested nine people carrying LSD-laced biscuits.
