The cost of Russian Kamov light-utility choppers, which will be built in India, will cost 2.5 times more than the cost of those built in Russia. 
Under the agreement with Russia, India will import 60 choppers, while 140 will be manufactured in a joint venture between the governments. 
The choppers will replace the vintage fleet of Cheetah and Chetak choppers.
