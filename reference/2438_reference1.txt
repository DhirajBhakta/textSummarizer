An explosive substance was found inside the Uttar Pradesh Assembly on Wednesday, following which a high-level meeting was called by CM Yogi Adityanath. Around 60 grams of white powder was found, which was later found to contain explosive substance PETN upon checking. Meanwhile, Adityanath has called for an NIA probe into the incident, saying it "could be a terror conspiracy."
