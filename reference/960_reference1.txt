The Noida traffic police on Sunday trained 20 civilian volunteers on road safety rules to assist them in regulating traffic. 
The police had earlier appealed to residents through social networking sites to help them reduce vehicular congestion and around 40 residents extended their support. 
The volunteers will work during peak traffic hours at intersections, markets, and roads.
