A 22-year-old Delhi man was arrested on Thursday for allegedly kidnapping two children in order to force their mother to marry him. 
Their father had complained to the police that the children were kidnapped from school and was reportedly suspicious of the accused, who was the mother's friend. 
The children, aged 8 and 10, were rescued.
