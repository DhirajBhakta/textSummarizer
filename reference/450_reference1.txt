US President Donald Trump used his speech to the 19th National Boy Scouts Jamboree in West Virginia to attack "fake media" for allegedly misquoting crowd size at his events. Trump also urged his audience of 12 to 18-year-olds to boo his presidential rival Hillary Clinton and predecessor Barack Obama. Trump was slammed for using the traditional address for political endorsements.
