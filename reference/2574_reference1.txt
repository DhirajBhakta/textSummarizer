Saleem Mirza, the driver of Amarnath bus which was attacked by terrorists, said that he just did his duty by not stopping as the firing started. 
"Out of the blue, it started raining bullets?
for a fraction of a second my mind went blank...I ducked and kept driving," he recalled. 
He added he'll go to Amarnath again if given a chance.
