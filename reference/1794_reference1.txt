Home Minister Rajnath Singh on Saturday said that a proposal to add 15,000 more personnel to the Delhi Police has been cleared by the Ministry of Home Affairs. 
Reportedly, Delhi Police has a total sanctioned strength of around 82,242 at present, of which 77,083 are filled. 
"I feel Delhi Police strength is not adequate. 
It has to increase," Singh added.
