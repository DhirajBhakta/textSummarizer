Almost 20 years after the Uphaar theatre fire, the Supreme Court on Thursday partially reviewed its previous judgement and awarded a one-year jail term to the theatre owner Gopal Ansal. He has been given four week's time to surrender. Considering the age, his elder brother Sushil Ansal's (75) sentence was reduced to 5 months, which he has already served.
