The Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) on Friday slammed the government over poor implementation of crop insurance schemes from 2011-16, including the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana. The CAG pointed out that delays by states in releasing compensation to affected farmers defeated "the objective of providing timely financial assistance", although the Centre released its share on time.
