The Mumbai Police on Monday arrested a 28-year-old drug-addict for stealing 200 trophies from a sports shop in Kalbadevi. The accused said he sneaked into the shop to steal money but stole trophies instead "as there wasn't any money", according to police officials. He was arrested the day after the robbery before he could sell the trophies, police added.
