NASA is planning to send its first robotic spacecraft to the Sun, 15 crore kms from Earth, to probe its atmosphere from a distance of 60 lakh kms. 
The mission is aimed at understanding why the Sun's atmosphere reaches 20,00,000?C, whereas, its surface temperature is just 5,500?C, and also to ascertain the emission of harmful high-energy particles, scientists said.
