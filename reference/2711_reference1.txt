A 24-year-old businessman allegedly committed suicide by jumping off the Bandra-Worli Sea Link in Mumbai at 3 AM on Sunday. 
A police officer said Pawanjeet Singh Kohli had been depressed since he heard the news of his former girlfriend's engagement and had googled the fastest way to kill himself. 
However, police officers have filed an accidental death report.
