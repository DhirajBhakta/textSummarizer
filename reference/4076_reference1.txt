Syedna Taher Fakruddin, who claims to be religious leader of Dawoodi Bohra community, has said the choice of going for female genital mutilation should be left to the woman only after she becomes an adult. 
"While the Sharia law has a provision for female genital mutilation, it shouldn't be performed on a woman until she becomes an adult," he stated.
