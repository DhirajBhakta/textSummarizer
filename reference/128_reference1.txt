Nearly 500 protestors pelted stones at the police outside Ghaziabad's Ala Hazrat Haj House and demanded that the facility be opened to pilgrims immediately. 
The Haj House, which is located along the Hindon river, has remained sealed since its inauguration last year after a petition was filed against it at the National Green Tribunal.
