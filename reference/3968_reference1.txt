Pakistan's former Interior minister, Rehman Malik, fell for an April Fools' Day prank when he reacted to a fake news about naming Islamabad's new airport after Chinese President Xi Jinping. 
Malik expressed serious reservations over renaming of the airport, which is originally named after Benazir Bhutto. 
He warned government that his party would take the issue to an extreme level.
