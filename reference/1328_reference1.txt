Pakistan on Wednesday placed 26/11 Mumbai attacks mastermind and Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD) chief Hafiz Saeed on its Exit Control List, two days after he and his four aides were put under house arrest. Saeed and 38 other individuals, who are linked to JuD or Lashkar-e-Taiba, have been placed on the list, which prohibits them from leaving Pakistan.
