More than 31 million people, that is one person every second, were displaced in their country in 2016 because of conflicts, violence and natural disasters, a Norwegian Refugee Council report has revealed. Adding that the Democratic Republic of the Congo was the worst affected country, the report said that natural disasters displaced over three times the number uprooted by conflicts.
