The Barhra High School in West Bengal's Arjjunshuli village has adopted a segregation policy after receiving complaints of boys harassing the girls. Boys in Classes 11 and 12 attend school on alternate days starting Monday, while girls attend classes alternately starting Tuesday. District education officials said they were not aware of the decision and called it "illegal".
