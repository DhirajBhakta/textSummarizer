Chinese archaeologists have announced the discovery of 10,000 gold and silver artefacts, including coins and jewellery, that sank to the bottom of a river in Sichuan Province 300 years ago. 
It is believed soldiers defeated peasant uprising leader Zhang Xianzhong in the area in 1646 while he was transferring his treasure. 
Around 1,000 boats carrying valuables sank during the skirmish.
