Jawaharlal Nehru University's teachers who participated in a day-long strike will lose one day's salary, according to a notice by the university registrar. 
The strike was observed on Tuesday after several teachers received notices asking them to "follow the rules" and not address students at administration building. 
Reportedly, protesting within 20 metres of the administration building is banned.
