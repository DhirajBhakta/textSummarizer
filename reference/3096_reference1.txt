A woman travelling with nine-month-old daughter in an autorickshaw in Gurugram was allegedly gang-raped by three men, who threw the baby out of the vehicle, leading to her death. One of the accused was the driver of the autorickshaw. Reportedly, she reached her in-law's place the next morning and boarded a metro to visit a doctor with the dead body.
