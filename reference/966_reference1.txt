The Dombivli Industries Association and the Dombivli, Ambernath, and Ulhasnagar municipal bodies will have to pay 96 crore for polluting the Ulhas river in Thane. The Supreme Court has passed an order vacating an earlier High Court judgement which had put on hold a National Green Tribunal's order asking the bodies to pay the fine to restore the river.
