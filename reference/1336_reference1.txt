The Indira Gandhi International in Delhi has done away with the body scanner machine installed at terminal 3 due to its subpar performance. 
"It has multiple technical loopholes and hence, we decided to remove it following recommendations from CISF," an official said. 
However, with no replacement, officials are back to scanning passengers through metal detectors, which is not considered foolproof.
