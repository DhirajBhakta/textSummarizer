An Alaska Airlines flight attendant has revealed that she once rescued a teenage girl who was a victim of human trafficking. Shelia Fedrick said she became concerned when she saw a dishevelled girl travelling beside an older, well-dressed man. The man was arrested after Fedrick left a note for the teenager in the bathroom, who replied saying she needed help.
