The Indian Railways on Thursday launched a Roll-on Roll-off (Ro-Ro) service to carry loaded trucks on wagons from Gurugram to Muradnagar in Uttar Pradesh. 
The service, launched by Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu, aims to decongest roads in Delhi NCR and reduce carbon emissions. 
The Ro-Ro service will use eight entry and exit routes to take trucks off the roads.
