An idol of Goddess Brajeshwari Devi made of 1,600 kilogram of clarified butter was unveiled at the Brajeshwari Devi temple in Himachal Pradesh on Sunday morning. The butter idol would be removed on January 20 and its 'prasad' would be distributed among the devotees. The idol is installed every year to mark the festival of Makar Sankranti.
