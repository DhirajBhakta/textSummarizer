A 12-year-old boy from Kerala is being called as India's youngest father, after a DNA test confirmed that he fathered a child born to a 17-year-old girl. 
The girl, who is the boy's first cousin and neighbour, has however alleged that she was raped by him. 
A Protection of Children from Sexual Offences case has been filed over the matter.
