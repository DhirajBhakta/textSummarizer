Union Minister of State for Finance Arjun Ram Meghwal on Thursday said that about 91 lakh new taxpayers have been added after demonetisation. 
"Demonetisation has promoted digital economy. 
Increased digital transaction has hurt the shadow economy which was flourishing unchecked," he said. 
Meghwal added that when history would be written, 2017 would be remembered as the year of economic reforms.
