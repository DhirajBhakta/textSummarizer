The members of a Norwegian anti-immigrant group have been trolled for mistaking a photograph of six empty bus seats for a group of women wearing burqas. 
The post, shared on  the closed Facebook group Fedrelandet viktigst (Fatherland first), garnered comments like "Get them out of our country" and "Could be terrorists." 
It was shared on the group as a prank.
