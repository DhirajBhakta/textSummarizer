An ISIS suspect from Bengaluru, who lived with a fake name in Himachal Pradesh's Kullu district church, was sentenced to five-year jail term by an NIA court on Thursday. 
He was arrested in December 2016 and was on NIA's radar. 
He confessed working with ISIS' sleeper cell and revealed that some of his plans didn't mature due to insufficient funds.
