The Bombay High Court on Tuesday slammed over 4,500 resident doctors in Maharashtra who had gone on mass leave since March 20 and asked them to join work or face action by the management. The HC was hearing a PIL filed against the strike wherein the advocate representing the petitioners claimed 58 people have died in Maharashtra since Monday.
