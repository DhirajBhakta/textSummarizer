No minister from the Union Cabinet attended President Pranab Mukherjee's last Iftar party as Indian President on Friday. 
Although Narendra Modi has not attended the Iftar party since he became Prime Minister, Rajnath Singh and Arun Jaitley have previously attended the annual event. 
However, Sonia Gandhi and Ghulam Nabi Azad attended the party held at Rashtrapati Bhavan.
