Prime Minister Narendra Modi has reportedly asked the Ministry of Defence to initiate theatre commands for the military, which would put the troops and resources of the three forces under one officer. 
New initiatives, including the appointment of a four-star general to look after the issues of the armed forces, would also be taken by the end of the year.
