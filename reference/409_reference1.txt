Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to close the Jerusalem office of Al Jazeera, accusing the news network of inciting violence amid protests against the country's heightened security measures outside the al-Aqsa mosque. 
Netanyahu said he would "enact the required legislation to expel Al Jazeera from Israel" if law enforcement agencies failed to close it.
