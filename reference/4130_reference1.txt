A Chinese man has been caught trying to smuggle more than 1,000 diamonds into Shenzhen from  Hong Kong by hiding them in his shoes. 
"[We were] suspicious as he sometimes tiptoed. 
When he found that we were looking at him, he quickly shifted to normal walking posture," said a customs officer. 
He was then asked to take his shoes off.
