As many as 77 votes were declared invalid in the Presidential elections, because of invalid symbols like commas, dots, and circles, according to the people involved in counting. 
The number '1' with a '.' was the most common mistake, while the "1" (one in inverted commas) came second. 
One voter wrote '1' on Meira Kumar's name instead of the box.
