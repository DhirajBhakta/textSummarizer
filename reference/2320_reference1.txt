Matunga suburban railway station in Mumbai has become the first station in India to be run by an all-women staff. 
A total of 30 women staffers, including eleven booking clerks, five Railway Protection Force (RPF) personnel and seven ticket checkers are working under station manager Mamta Kulkarni, who was the first female station master in Central Railway's Mumbai division.
