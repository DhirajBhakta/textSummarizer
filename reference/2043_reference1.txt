The ruling AIADMK in Tamil Nadu has rejected opposition parties' demand for issuing 'white paper', a government report giving information on an issue, on the treatment given to Late CM J Jayalalithaa. 
AIADMK Spokesperson C Ponnaiyan termed the demand for white paper as a planned campaign against Sasikala Natarajan, the long-time close aide of Jayalalithaa and prospective party general secretary.
