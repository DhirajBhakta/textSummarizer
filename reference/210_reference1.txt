A Kerala BJP unit has alleged that CPI(M) workers hurled a petrol bomb at an RSS office in the state, causing damage to the building. 
This was followed by CPI(M) blaming BJP-RSS activists for pelting stones at a committee office of CPI(M) trade union-wing CITU. 
Notably, the state has been witnessing unrest after an RSS worker was killed last week.
