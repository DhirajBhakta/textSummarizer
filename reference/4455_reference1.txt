The President of Poland's Supreme Court Malgorzata Gersdorf has urged the country's judges to "fight every inch" for justice as the ruling party plans to "democratise" the way judges are appointed. 
Under the government's proposals, the terms of all judges will be terminated within 90 days of the draft law's enactment and their replacements would be selected by Polish parliament.
