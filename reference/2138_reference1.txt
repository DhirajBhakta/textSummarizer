Former Supreme Court Judge Markandey Katju on Friday offered an unconditional apology to the SC in a contempt of court case for allegedly criticising the court judges for their verdict in Soumya rape and murder case. 
In his personal blog, Katju had described the court's judgment, setting aside the death penalty of the convict, in the case as "legally flawed".
