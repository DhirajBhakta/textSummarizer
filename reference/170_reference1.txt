Around 44,000 toilets need to be built daily by the Uttar Pradesh government to make the state open defecation free (ODF) by October 2, 2018, Chief Secretary Rajiv Kumar said on Monday. 
He further directed district magistrates to speed up the construction work and said they should devote at least half an hour daily to monitor the progress.
