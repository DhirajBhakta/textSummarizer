Bengaluru firm IDC Technologies, located in Madiwala, does not provide cab services to women for pick-up and drop, and has allegedly said that it is not responsible for women's safety after they log out. A female employee from the firm met IT Minister Priyank Kharge to bring up the matter, and the minister has assured action after a formal complaint.
