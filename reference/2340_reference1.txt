The 13-year-old Delhi girl who was raped after being abducted in May and was rescued by the police recently, has expressed willingness to return to her 'husband', claiming that the 'rapist' had married her. The police said they are clueless about their future course of action because the pregnant minor girl has refused to return to her parents.
