A five-legged lamb which was born at a farm in the UK has been named 'Forrest' after Hollywood actor Tom Hanks' character from the 1994 film 'Forrest Gump'. The lamb was named so in the hope that its extra limb gives it the same love of running as the film's character. "It's happy- drinking, running around," said the farm's owner.
