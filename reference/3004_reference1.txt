A Gurugram man flung his 4-month-old puppy from the first floor after she dropped his laptop and chewed the DTH wires on Tuesday night. Though the man denied the act, his wife admitted saying "Generally, we love her, but that day, it really damaged the whole laptop, chewed up wires and everything. My husband got angry and flung it."
