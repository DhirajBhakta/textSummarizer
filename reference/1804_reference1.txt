Kerala-based Sreelakshmi Satheesh has said she made a man donate 25,000 to charity after he shared her number on a WhatsApp group, saying she was available. Men began calling Satheesh, the CEO of an educational consultancy firm, and asking for her "rate." Satheesh later discovered who had shared her number and threatened to complain if he didn't donate to charity.
