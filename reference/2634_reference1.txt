The Delhi government, under its City Taxi Scheme, 2017, is planning to prevent cab aggregators including Uber Pool and Ola Share from offering shared rides. 
Cab aggregators have 'contract carriage permits', which only allows point-to-point transportation with no stopovers on the route of a ride, according to officials. 
The scheme is in the final stages of scrutiny before being implemented.
