A group of locals and Kanwarias allegedly set on fire a motorcycle owned by an unidentified man after it hit their Kanwar procession in Gurugram's Sohna on Thursday. 
The Kanwarias alleged that three youths on a bike intentionally hit them and escaped soon after. 
The police, however, maintained that it was a minor accident and are probing the matter.
