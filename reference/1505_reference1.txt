Six policemen carried a 23-year-old pregnant woman for over three hours through a snow-capped village in Himachal Pradesh, to ensure she reached the hospital. 
They carried the woman, Kamini, in a chair for 10 kilometres as an ambulance was unable to reach her home due to snowfall. 
Kamini later gave birth to a baby girl at the hospital in Shimla.
