Delhi's Jazz music club 'Piano Man' has sparked a controversy for allegedly insulting the Dalit community by agreeing to host a band named 'Bhangijumping'. 
A change.org petition has also been created demanding shutting down of the "casteist club". 
The petition added that when the issue was brought to the club's notice, it justified the name 'Bhangi' calling it 'artistic expression'.
