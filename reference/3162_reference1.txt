Maharashtra farmers, who are currently on an indefinite strike in protest against the state's inaction, emptied a milk van onto a road on World Milk Day on Thursday. 
The farmers also stopped goods-carrying trucks on highways and threw away fruits and vegetables in the trucks. 
They have been demanding crop loan waivers, interest-free loans and a pension scheme, among others.
