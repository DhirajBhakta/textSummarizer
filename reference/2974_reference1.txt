Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday said neither 'kisan' (farmers) nor jawans have been happy since Prime Minister Narendra Modi's BJP government assumed power in 2014. Stating that the farmers have been "betrayed" by the Modi government, Kejriwal added,  "Where is the development in our land, if farmers are boycotting their own produce and throwing them on roads"
