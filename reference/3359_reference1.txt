A leader of militant outfit Hizbul Mujahideen has warned Hurriyat leaders that their heads will be chopped off and hung in Srinagar's Lal Chowk. This comes after Hurriyat had said the struggle by people in Kashmir is a political struggle and not a religious one. The message, which was delivered through a video clip, called the separatist leaders as "infidels".
