The Jammu and Kashmir government has decided to relieve teachers from being a part of election duties to ensure that the education system doesn't suffer. 
"We want to provide teachers with a congenial atmosphere," said state's Education Minister Syed Altaf Bukhari. 
The state will go for bypolls next month for the parliament seats in Srinagar and Anantnag.
