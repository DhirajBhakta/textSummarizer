Delhi village Kadipur has free WiFi with 24-hour connectivity but lacks basic civic amenities like regular water supply. 
The village, which was adopted by BJP MP Manoj Tiwari in 2014, also faces issues like broken roads and choked drains. 
"It would have been better if the government fixed this (water supply) instead of spending on internet connectivity," a resident said.
