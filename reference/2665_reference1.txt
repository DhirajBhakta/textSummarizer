A man rescued a 27-year-old sex worker from a brothel in Delhi's GB Road after falling in love with her. He said they have been together since he visited her as a customer two years ago. He wants to marry the girl, who came to India seeking employment after the 2015 Nepal earthquake, but was tricked into prostitution.
