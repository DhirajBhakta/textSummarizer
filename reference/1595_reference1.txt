Sasi Gangadharan, a semi-paralysed man from Kerala has dug out a motorable road all by himself. He has carved out a kaccha road measuring 200-meter, working 6 hours daily for the past three years. The panchayat had earlier turned down his request for a three-wheeler to set up a small business, stating there is no motorable road till his house.
