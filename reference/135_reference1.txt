More than half of university students in Australia were sexually harassed at least once in 2016, according to a Human Rights Commission survey. With over 30,000 responses registered across the country, it was found that women experienced harassment and assaults at higher rates than men. The survey was conducted amid claims that universities were responding poorly to sexual assault incidents.
