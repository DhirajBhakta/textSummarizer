A six-year-old girl in Meerut offered her piggy bank as bribe to police to arrest her mother's killers. The girl named Manvi visited the office of Meerut's Inspector General (IG) of Police to seek justice for her mother, who allegedly committed suicide after harassment by her in-laws. The cops were demanding 50,000, after which the child made the symbolic move.
