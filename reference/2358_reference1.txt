A coaching centre in Jammu and Kashmir's Srinagar has put pictures of a boy killed in a Pakistani school terrorist attack and of a Pakistani-Canadian comedian in a newspaper ad about its successful candidates. 
While some trolled  the coaching centre on social media, several others raised concerns on whether such coaching centres show fake students in their successful candidates' list.
