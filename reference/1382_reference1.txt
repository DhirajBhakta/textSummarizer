Delhi Police on Friday busted a gang of imposters, who extorted money from politicians and bureaucrats by pretending to be politicians of the Congress or BJP. 
They allegedly used to demand money for party funds for the upcoming state elections. 
The imposters would also promise the victims a bigger role in the party or an election ticket.
