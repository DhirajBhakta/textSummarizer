Five people, including four from a family, were killed when the Kolkata-bound Maitree Express rammed into a car at a level crossing in Gazipur, Bangladesh on Sunday. 
The train which runs between India and Bangladesh reportedly dragged the car for around 200 metres. 
Railway officials admitted that the level crossing was unmanned and it did not have a boom barrier.
