The Uttarakhand High Court on Thursday ordered the seizure of all EVMs used in Vikasnagar constituency during Assembly elections, as requested by Congress leader Navprabhat in a petition alleging EVM tampering. 
The HC also sought a response in this regard from the Election Commission, the state Election Commission, and the BJP's Vikasnagar MLA MS Chauhan within six weeks.
