BJP President Amit Shah today said, "everyone present in the public meeting knows with what objective I called Mahatma Gandhi a baniya," defending his statement that Gandhi knew Congress was a tool to fight for freedom. 
After Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala demanded an apology for "belittling" Gandhi, Shah added, "Surjewala has a lot to answer on Mahatma Gandhi's principles."
