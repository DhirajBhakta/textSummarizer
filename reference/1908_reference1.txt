A woman and a teenage boy blew themselves up on Saturday in Bangladesh capital Dhaka after a counter-terrorism police unit raided a three-storey building where Islamist militants were hiding. 
Police said the militants are believed to be from the group responsible for the Dhaka cafe attack. 
Reportedly, four people, including two women and two children, came out and surrendered later.
