The Noida authority has decided to repaint road markings in an attempt to streamline and regulate traffic movement on city roads. 
This comes after its traffic cell found that 80% of road markings either get washed away or fade out on their own. 
The project involves marking of zebra crossings, left-right turns and stop lines for vehicles among others.
