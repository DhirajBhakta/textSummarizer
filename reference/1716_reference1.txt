Newly-appointed Army Chief General Bipin Rawat has said that the Indian forces would cross the border again if peace and tranquility are not maintained after attempting to resolve things through negotiations. "Wars will be intense and short because there will always be international pressure... Whatever action we take, therefore, has to be quick; forces have to be ready," Rawat added.
