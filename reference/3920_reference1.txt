Hybrid electric aircraft startup Zunum Aero, founded by Indian-origin entrepreneur Ashish Kumar, has received investments from aerospace companies Boeing and JetBlue. 
The startup intends to make regional aircrafts with space for 10 to 50 passengers for flights up to 1,600 km. 
"Our goal is to be part of a disruptive force rather than the one being disrupted," said JetBlue.
