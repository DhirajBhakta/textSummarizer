The Supreme Court on Tuesday rebuked the Bihar government for seeking two years' time to appoint 174 stenographers in the police. "You are making fun of this court. You can hold one single test for stenographers and recruit them," stated the apex court. The court is monitoring the filling up of police vacancies in all states.
