A war memorial built to honour soldiers killed during the 1962 Indo-China War was reportedly vandalised on Tuesday in Gurugram's Palam Vihar. 
Officials managing the memorial said several stone benches and floodlights were broken. 
The memorial was built in 2012 in memory of the 114 soldiers who were killed during the battle at Rezang La Pass in 1962.
