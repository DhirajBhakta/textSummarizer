The annual media trip to Tibet organised by China for journalists from its neighbouring countries has been cancelled for five Indian journalists amid the India-China stand-off. 
No official reason was given by Chinese embassy officials. 
Indian Association of Foreign Affairs Correspondents Convenor Vijay Naik said the Chinese may be waiting for a conducive atmosphere to resume the media programme.
