The doctors in Telangana's biggest government-run Gandhi Hospital in Hyderabad chanted the Mahamrityunjaya mantra to bring down the rising number of deaths of newborns in the hospital. 
Patients complained of the unavailability of doctors as the pooja, which was reportedly approved by the senior doctors, went on for hours. 
A probe has been ordered in the case.
