The Delhi government on Monday decided to stop grants to 28 Delhi University colleges following the varsity's failure to form their governing bodies. 
"I cannot allow unchecked corruption and irregularities to be sustained on Delhi govt funds in the name of education,? 
Deputy CM Manish Sisodia tweeted. 
Twelve out of the 28 colleges are fully funded by the Delhi government.
