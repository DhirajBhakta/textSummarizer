Posters supporting BJP leader Lal Krishna Advani for the post of the President were spotted outside the headquarters of the party in New Delhi. 
The posters, however, were torn apart and thrown outside the party office later. 
The posters described Advani as the best-suited contender for the post and were published in the name of a farm leader.
