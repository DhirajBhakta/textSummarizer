A prematurely-born girl child, who was declared dead by a male nurse at a hospital in Rajasthan, 'came back to life' on Tuesday at a crematorium where her body was taken for last rites. 
The on-duty nurse had declared the newborn dead when he noticed that she was neither crying nor breathing, but she suddenly started crying at the crematorium.
