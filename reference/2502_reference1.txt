Biju Janata Dal (BJD) MLA Manas Madkami defended being carried on people's shoulders to prevent his clothes from getting dirty in a patch of muddy water in Odisha's Malkangiri on Tuesday. "It was the overwhelming affection of supporters which prompted them to act in such manner. They felt elated while lifting me and crossing the water body," he said.
