The Delhi government has released 100 crore for the completion of the Signature Bridge, which is twice the height of the Qutub Minar. The bridge was supposed to be ready by 2010 Commonwealth Games, but its construction was slowed down due to insufficient funds. Delhi Tourism Minister Rajendra Pal Gautam said that nearly 92% of the project has been completed.
