The US House of Representatives has voted for three legislative amendments to impose tougher conditions for reimbursement of defence funding to Pakistan. The amendments make it conditional for Pakistan to show satisfactory progress in its fight against terrorism. "The Congress has taken a step forward to end Pakistan's betrayal of the US," the House representatives said.
