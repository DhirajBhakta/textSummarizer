Several nightclubs and bars in Delhi are planning to organise a special screening of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's address on New Year's eve. 
Bar managers have said that customers are enquiring about the arrangements for Modi's speech before booking tables. 
Meanwhile, a senior police officer said that police personnel will be deployed at bars telecasting his speech.
