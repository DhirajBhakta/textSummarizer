Union Minister Sushma Swaraj has advised Geeta, the deaf-mute woman who was brought from Pakistan to India, not to leave her premises without informing anyone. 
This comes after she went missing on July 6 for a brief period from Indore's Institute for Speech and Hearing Impaired, following which a search operation was launched and she was found at a temple.
