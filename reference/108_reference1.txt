China will never seek "aggression or expansion" but will not allow anyone to "split its territory", President Xi Jinping said amid the ongoing standoff between Indian and Chinese troops along the Sikkim border. 
He also urged the country's Army to forge an elite and powerful force that is always "ready for the fight, capable of combat and sure to win".
