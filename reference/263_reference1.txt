Between 2012 and 2017, 523 cases of wetland destruction were reported in Maharashtra, according to a report by Mumbai-based NGO Vanashakti. While ten major cases were reported from Mumbai Metropolitan Region, most cases were reported in other areas such as Thane and Dombivli. Bombay High Court had banned construction on wetlands after the NGO filed a PIL to protect them.
