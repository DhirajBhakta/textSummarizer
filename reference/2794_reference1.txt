An Australian man named Meow-Ludo Disco Gamma Meow-Meow has implanted a travel card chip into his left hand, enabling him to tap in and out at train stations. He said his new implant gives him "an ability not everyone else has," and added, "If someone stole my wallet, I could still get home." Meow-Meow has another implant for important documents.
