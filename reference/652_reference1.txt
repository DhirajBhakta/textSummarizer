US President Donald Trump has attacked The New York Times in a tweet, alleging that one of its reports led to the failure of a US bid to capture ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. 
However, US media suggested Trump was referring to a Fox News report which allegedly leaked information about US efforts to capture Baghdadi.
