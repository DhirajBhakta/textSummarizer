The members of the Bharatiya Bar Girls Union in Maharashtra on Monday said to the Supreme Court that the prevailing ban-like atmosphere in the state could push bar dancers into activities like prostitution. 
The union further reminded the court that the closing down of the bars in 2005 had left over 75,000 female workers unemployed.
