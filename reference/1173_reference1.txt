The Delhi High Court on Tuesday stayed the AAP government's nursery admission norm, which made it mandatory for private unaided schools to accept admission forms based on the neighbourhood criteria. 
Justice Manmohan termed the notification as "arbitrary, unreasonable and against public interest." 
The notification gave priority to people living within a radius of 1 kilometre from the school.
