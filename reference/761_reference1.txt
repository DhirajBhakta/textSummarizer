Interpol has circulated a list of 173 Islamic State fighters it believes could carry out suicide attacks in Europe, in revenge for ISIS' military defeats. 
The list mentions suspects' identities, last likely address, mosques they prayed at, date ISIS recruited them and mothers' names. 
It is based on information captured during the offensive against ISIS in Iraq and Syria.
