Before the hearing on the death sentence awarded to Kulbhushan Jadhav, the last time India and Pakistan faced off at the International Court of Justice was nearly 18 years ago. 
Islamabad had sought the court's intervention over the shooting down of its naval aircraft by the Indian Air Force in 1999. 
A 16-judge bench voted 14-2 to dismiss Pakistan's case.
