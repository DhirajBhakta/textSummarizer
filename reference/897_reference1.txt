Gang members in New Zealand are reportedly planning to organise a 'fight club' involving boxing matches between rival gangs that leaders hope will present a way to vent tension. 
The organisers claimed that a series of killings in Northland last year had escalated gang tensions. 
Notably, 80% of violence in the region is related to disputes over drugs.
