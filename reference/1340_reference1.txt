The Pufferfish, commonly known as Blowfish and Fugu, is considered a delicacy in Japan even though it is fatally poisonous. 
Reportedly 1200 times more poisonous than cyanide and without a known antidote, Fugu poisoning can cause death by asphyxiation within 10 minutes. 
Japan strictly controls its restaurant preparation by law, and chefs take 3-10 years' training to prepare it properly.
