Egypt's highest Islamic authority Al-Azhar Al-Sharif has opened a fatwa kiosk at Cairo metro to offer commuters religious advice in an effort to counter extremism. 
A sheikh said, "We usually talk about the issues of daily life, and what religion says about such things. 
The topics we mostly discuss are marriage, divorce and inheritance."
