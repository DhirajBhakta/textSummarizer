UK's Minister of State for Security Ben Wallace has warned that Islamic State militants want to carry out mass casualty chemical attacks in Britain. 
ISIS has "no moral barrier" in using chemical weapons which would be "everybody's worst fear", he said. 
Wallace further warned that British ISIS militants may return home posing a domestic threat after ISIS is defeated.
