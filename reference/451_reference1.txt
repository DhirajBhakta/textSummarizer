Israel has removed metal detectors from the entrance of Jerusalem's al-Aqsa mosque following days of violent protests over the installation. 
The move is aimed at ending the crisis which claimed seven lives, Israeli officials said. 
The Palestinians reportedly see the installation of metal detectors as an Israeli attempt to assert control over the holy site.
