Bengaluru Police on Friday recovered old demonetised notes worth 40 crore from the residence of a former corporator, who has been identified as V Nagraj. The house of the accused was raided after the police received a tip-off about the cash. Nagraj, who also contested elections in 2004, was reportedly involved in a kidnapping case in the past.
