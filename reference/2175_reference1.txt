Students and university teachers on Monday protested in Mumbai over delays in declaration of results by University of Mumbai (MU). 
The university failed to declare results within 45 days of examination, as required by law, due to MU's new on-screen marking process that led to the delay. 
Protestors claimed this may hinder job and higher education opportunities for the students.
