Head of Iran's atomic energy organisation, Ali Akbar Salehi, has warned the US to stop upsetting the regional balance of power by siding with Saudi Arabia. 
Referring to Saudi's purchase of $100-billion worth of US arms during President Donald Trump's recent visit to Riyadh, Salehi said "lavish arms purchases" by regional actors would be seen as provocative in Iran.
