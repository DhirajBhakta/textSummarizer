A woman in Assam killed her husband for allegedly raping their teenage daughter. 
"The woman alleges that her husband routinely misbehaved with their daughter and had even raped her. 
That's the reason she decided to kill him," police said. 
Husband's body was found in a field by villagers and bore several wound marks, probably inflicted by a sharp dagger.
