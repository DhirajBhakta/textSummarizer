The Delhi Metro has used waste material to construct a 42,000-square-metre park in east Delhi. 
The park, which has been named Eco Park, will open to the public in two months. 
The DMRC said that it will generate energy using solar panels and house an artificial lake, an open theatre, a CISF Parade Ground and a multi-purpose hall.
