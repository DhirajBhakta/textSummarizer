Bhiku Daji Bhilare, who claimed to have saved Gandhi from an earlier assassination attempt by Nathuram Godse in 1944, passed away on Wednesday at the age of 98. 
According to Mahatma Gandhi's great grandson's book, there were four attempts on Gandhi's life before Godse killed him in 1948. 
Bhilare reportedly foiled the second attack in Panchgani by overpowering Godse.
