The Supreme Court on Friday agreed to hear a plea submitted by convicts in the Nirbhaya gangrape case claiming that there were six "fundamental errors" in the sentencing procedure. The plea claimed the trial court did not consider the special circumstances of each of the accused. The SC will decide when to rehear sentencing of the case on February 6.
