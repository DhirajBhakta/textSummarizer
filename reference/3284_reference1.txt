Former Finance Minister and senior Congress leader P Chidambaram's son Karti Chidambaram left for London on Thursday after the CBI raided his residence in connection with money-laundering in the Aircel-Maxis deal. 
"Karti is travelling as per earlier travel plans. 
He will return after a few days. 
There is no ban on his travel," P Chidambaram said.
