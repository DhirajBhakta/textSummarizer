UK's National Health Service (NHS) has announced plans to stop doctors from prescribing homeopathic remedies. Aiming to save around £200 million a year, the NHS chief described homeopathy as at best a placebo and a misuse of funds. The plans also list 17 other items that will no longer be prescribed for reasons ranging from low clinical to low cost-effectiveness.
