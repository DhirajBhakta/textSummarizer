Commenting on the arrest of Stayzilla Co-founder Yogendra Vasupal over unpaid dues, Karnataka IT Minister Priyank Kharge said, giving one-sided support to Vasupal is "like endorsing Vijay Mallya." Kharge clarified that his earlier tweet in which he intervened in the Stayzilla controversy was meant to help Vasupal, but only if he was on the right side of the law.
