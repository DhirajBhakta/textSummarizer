Astronaut Neil Armstrong, who became the first man ever to walk on the moon on July 21, 1969, could not afford life insurance before embarking on the mission. 
Armstrong and other members of the crew autographed envelopes emblazoned with Apollo 11 crew emblem, which they hoped could provide financial support to their families in the event of their demise.
