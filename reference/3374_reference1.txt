The Supreme Court has taken differing views on the question of precedence of personal laws over fundamental rights. 
In 1985, the court directed Muslim woman Shah Bano's husband to pay her alimony according to the laws applicable to other Indians. 
In several separate cases, the court said personal laws could not be challenged for being in violation of fundamental rights.
