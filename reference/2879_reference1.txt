A Delhi preschool recently organised a monkey dance for its students, following which Union Minister Maneka Gandhi intervened and its principal was removed. 
The school had advertised the event online, following which users informed Gandhi. 
The Rhesus Macaque monkey is protected under the Wildlife Protection Act, and using it for entertainment invites a punishment of up to seven years' jail.
