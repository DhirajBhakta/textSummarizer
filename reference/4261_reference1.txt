A 28-year-old mother-of-two jumped off a first-floor Delhi apartment on Sunday after she was allegedly abducted and gang-raped by five men, said the police. The police have arrested the accused, who claimed she was into prostitution and had fixed a "deal" with them. Police officers said, "she has changed her statement twice," and that a medical examination has confirmed rape.
