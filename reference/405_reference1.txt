Maharashtra government has announced plans to undertake an audit of helipads across the state, weeks after Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis's helicopter survived two near-accidents. 
Fadnavis said they plan to introduce a handbook on the standard operating procedure to provide security to VIPs. 
Fadnavis also said the state was in the process of acquiring helicopters on short-term leases.
