The Padmini Palace in Chittorgarh Fort was on Sunday vandalised by the Karni Sena members who also broke the mirrors hanging from its walls. 
The members of the group claimed that mirrors were not in existence during Padmavati's era and were put up much later. 
The group also rejected claims that Allaudin Khilji had seen Padmavati's face through a mirror.
