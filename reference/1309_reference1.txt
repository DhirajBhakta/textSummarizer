Special roses have been named after President Pranab Mukherjee and his wife Suvra at the Mughal Gardens in Rashtrapati Bhavan. The 'President Pranab' rose is yellow, while the 'Suvra Mukherjee' rose is pinkish-purple. This is the first time a rose has been named after a President, although the Mughal Gardens already have roses named after Queen Elizabeth and Christian Dior.
