A book on Yoga guru Baba Ramdev has revealed that while greeting someone over phone, instead of saying hello, he chants 'Om'. 
The book further says that young Ramdev, moved by Dayanand Saraswati's writings, quit school, fled from home, and enrolled himself in a 'gurukul'. 
"I wanted to follow the path shown by the ancient sages," Ramdev claimed.
