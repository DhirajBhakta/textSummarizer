On being asked during a question-and-answer session at a school what he plans to do after the presidency, Russian President Vladimir Putin said, "I haven't decided yet if I'll leave the presidency." 
Putin served as President for two 4-year terms, from 2000 to 2008, and then began a 6-year term in 2012. 
Notably, Russia bans three consecutive presidential terms.
