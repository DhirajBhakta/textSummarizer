The Maharashtra government is reportedly considering reserving seats in colleges for students who live nearby. 
This comes after several legislators complained that junior college students are forced to travel longer distances despite having many colleges near their homes. 
Education Minister Vinod Tawde said the department will hold a meeting of all stakeholders to discuss the issue.
