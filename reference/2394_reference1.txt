The police on Thursday booked a man in Mumbai for hurting religious feelings over a comment he made on Facebook against Shiv Sena founder Bal Thackeray. 
Reportedly, the man commented abuses on a post praising Thackeray's stand against terrorism. 
Earlier, two girls were arrested for expressing displeasure on Facebook over a bandh after Thackeray's death.
