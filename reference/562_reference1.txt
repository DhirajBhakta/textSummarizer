A German man swims 2 km to work every day to avoid traffic, packing his laptop and suit into a waterproof bag. 
Benjamin David, who swims along the Isar river in Munich, said his commute is faster than driving in traffic. 
He added, "the traffic on the road next to the Isar is so wild that it is no fun."
