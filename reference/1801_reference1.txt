As many as five prisoners escaped from Bihar's Buxar Central Jail late on Friday night. 
The inmates managed to escape from the jail's medical ward, where they were undergoing treatment. 
They reportedly broke the window of the medical ward's toilet to escape. 
While one of the prisoners was serving death sentence, the other four were facing life imprisonment.
