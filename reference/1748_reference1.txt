IndiGo cabin crew were forced to tie a reportedly unruly passenger to his seat on a flight from Dubai to Delhi on Tuesday, as he turned violent. 
The passenger, who had started shouting and pushing fellow fliers, was later handed over to the police. 
Notably, passengers can be restrained if their behaviour poses a risk to others and the aircraft.
