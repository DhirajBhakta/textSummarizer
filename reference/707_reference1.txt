Mumbai police has arrested a BMC sweeper who would pose as a Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (MHADA) official by night and dupe people by illegally sanctioning flats. The accused claimed he would give the keys of the flat soon, but would say he was waiting for an auspicious day whenever a victim called to ask, an officer said.
