US-based researchers have identified that the human appendix, which is often viewed as a vestigial organ with little-known use, may serve as a reservoir for beneficial gut bacteria. 
Mammals with an appendix were found to have higher concentrations of lymphoid tissue in the cecum, a pouch from which the appendix develops, suggesting that appendix serves as a secondary immune organ.
