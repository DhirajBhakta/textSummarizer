Japan-based scientists have created a highly flexible material, five times tougher than carbon steel, by combining hydrogels with glass fibre. 
The reinforced hydrogel contains 40% water and is environment-friendly. 
The flexible material could be used in manufacturing, fashion, and even making artificial human body joints, which are subject to strong load-bearing tensions, researchers said.
