Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation is planning to redevelop eight entry points of Mumbai's Juhu beach in the second phase by August-end, authorities said. 
As per the plan, each entry point will have five metre high walls, and steps with railings among others. 
While residents welcomed the move, an activist said that any beautification shouldn't affect "the natural feel of the beach".n
