The 21-year-old YouTuber, who was detained by cops on Friday for posting an objectionable 'prank' video on his channel 'The Crazy Sumit', has claimed that women in the video were his friends. In the video, Sumit was seen fleeing after kissing random women in public places. He also told the police that "the video was shot to get maximum hits".
