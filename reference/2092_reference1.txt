A leopard that was spotted at Yamuna Biodiversity Park in Delhi last month was released in the Shivalik ranges at Saharanpur in Uttar Pradesh on Monday. 
The three-year-old male feline was spotted roaming inside the park and was later trapped near a village, located on the periphery of the park. 
The leopard underwent medical tests before being released.
