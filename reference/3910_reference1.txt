Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath has decided to drop the word 'Samajwadi' from all government schemes and replace it with 'Mukhyamantri'. The former SP regime had implemented a number of projects with the word 'Samajwadi', including pension and smartphone schemes. Last week, the word 'Samajwadi' was dropped from the state's ambulance service, after a directive by the State Health Minister.
