Congress has alleged that arms and lethal weapons training is being imparted to Bajrang Dal and VHP volunteers in Assam to terrorise it. 
Assam's Congress Committee chief said, "The training is being given with a motive to attack the rival parties". 
The leader also met Union Minister Rajnath Singh and demanded action against "those practising this without a valid licence".
