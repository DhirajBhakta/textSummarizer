UK's first woman Sikh MP Preet Kaur Gill has been elected to the Home Affairs Select Committee in the country's Parliament. 
Gill, who was also chosen to head the All Party Parliamentary Group for British Sikhs, said that the "Parliament must reflect the people it serves". 
The Labour MP had won from the Edgbaston seat in last month's general elections.
