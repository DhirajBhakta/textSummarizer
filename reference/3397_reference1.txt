Assam's Education Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma has said that the state government is planning to eliminate the controlling boards of the madrassas and Sanskrit educational institutions to "mainstream" them. 
"We want to introduce modern learning like computers in these educational institutes. 
For doing this, we have to change the existing structure," the Minister stated in the state Assembly.
