Punjab Congress MLA Surjit Dhiman has slammed the CM Captain Amarinder Singh-led government over the inactive anti-drug drive initiated in the state. 
Claiming that "chitta" (drugs) was "easily available in every nook and corner," he said the state-sponsored anti-drug drive was "effective for only the first 15 days of government."
