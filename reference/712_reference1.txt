New Delhi Municipal Council is reportedly planning to stop vehicular movement in Connaught Place on weekends in order to decongest the area which gets around 5 lakh visitors every day. 
A pilot-launch of the plan is scheduled for August and after studying traffic flow and parking issues, the Council will decide whether the arrangement should be made permanent or not.
