Deputy Superintendent of Police Ayub Pandit was lynched by a mob outside Jamia Masjid in Jammu and Kashmir's Srinagar on Thursday. 
While the exact reason was not revealed by the authorities, several reports claim that the incident took place after he was seen filming outside the mosque and opened fire at a group of people that asked him to stop.
