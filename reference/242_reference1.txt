Two religious leaders in Canada, including one with 25 wives and 146 children, have been found guilty of polygamy and face five years in prison in a landmark ruling. 
The two men are senior figures in a Mormon sect that allows polygamy. 
They couldn't be prosecuted earlier over concerns that the anti-polygamy law violated Canadians' constitutional right to religious freedom.
