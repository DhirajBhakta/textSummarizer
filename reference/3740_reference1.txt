The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) is set to get its first 'driverless' trains on tracks between Noida and Kalkaji in June this year. 
These trains will run only on two metro lines ? 
Pink (Mukundpur-Shiv Vihar) and Magenta (Botanical Garden-Janakpuri West) ? 
and cannot be integrated with the other existing lines. 
Trials on these lines started last year.
