Almost two years after eight-year-old Zion Harvey from the US became the first-ever child to receive a double hand transplant, the doctors involved have declared the operation successful. 
The kid had both his hands and feet amputated aged two due to sepsis infection. 
He underwent eight rejections of hands after the surgery, but they were reversed using immunosuppression drugs.
