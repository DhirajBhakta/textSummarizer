Calcutta High Court Judge Justice CS Karnan ordered a psychiatric medical examination for the seven Supreme Court judges who ordered the same test on him in a contempt case. 
"I direct DGP, New Delhi to take the seven accused and produce them to psychiatric medical board attached to AIIMS and conduct medical test," Justice Karnan said.
