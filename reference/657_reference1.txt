Ganesh mandals across Mumbai have been demanding that noise norms in Silent Zones of the city should be relaxed for Ganeshotsav. Silent Zones are areas within 100 metres of hospitals, courts, educational or religious institutions where noise levels must not exceed 45 decibels. Notably, the state government has also asked for relaxation of Silence Zones norms ahead of the festival.
