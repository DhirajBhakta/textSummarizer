Mexican photographer Sergio Tapiro Velasco, who captured the explosion of a volcano with lightning connecting the ash cloud and volcano surface in 2015, has been named National Geographic Travel Photographer of the Year 2017. The friction in the ash particles generated a lightning bolt about 600 metres long between the ash and the volcano, Velasco described.
