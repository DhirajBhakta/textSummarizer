The Delhi High Court has warned two Delhi residents against feeding or sheltering stray dogs in the common area of a private property stating that dogs can "cause fear and discomfort" to others living there. 
Notably, the Supreme Court had earlier ruled that "stray dogs have a right to live" over a submission demanding complete elimination of stray dogs.
