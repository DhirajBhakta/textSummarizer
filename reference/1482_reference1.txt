Outgoing US President Barack Obama on Thursday expressed his gratitude to Americans by posting a letter on Facebook. 
"Throughout these eight years, you have been the source of goodness, resilience...from which I've pulled strength," Obama wrote. 
"When the arc of progress seems slow, remember: America is not the project of any one person," he added.
