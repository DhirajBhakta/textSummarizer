Fifty-three Indian fishermen were released from a Sri Lankan jail on Friday, days after the two countries decided to release fishermen in each other's custody. 
The move was aimed at defusing tension following the killing of an Indian fisherman allegedly by the Sri Lankan navy. 
Another 32 Indian fishermen are still in custody in Vuvuniya jail, Fishery Ministry officials said.
