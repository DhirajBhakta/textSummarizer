Union Human Resource Development Minister Prakash Javadekar has said that next year onwards, the question paper for the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) will be the same in all languages. 
This comes after the Madras High Court stayed the exam results this year. 
The court was hearing a petition which claimed that questions in vernacular languages were tougher.
