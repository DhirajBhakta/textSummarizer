Kargil martyr's daughter Gurmehar Kaur's picture from an old campaign holding placard "Pakistan did not kill my dad, war killed him" is being trolled by Twitter users. 
While one user tweeted Dawood Ibrahim's picture that read, "I didn't kill people in 1993, bombs killed them", another posted Rahul Gandhi's photo stating, "I did not destroy Congress, my speeches did".
