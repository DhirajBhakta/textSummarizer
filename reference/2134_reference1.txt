Foreign Secretary S Jaishankar has asked China not to give a political colour to India's aspiration to join the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG). "Keeping in mind...solidarity of major developing states, it is important that China views this as a developmental aspiration," he said. Despite both countries facing terrorism, they weren't cooperating as effectively as they should, Jaishankar added.
