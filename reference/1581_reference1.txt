As many as five localities in Central Delhi, including Jor Bagh and Pandara Park, will be made zero-waste colonies by 2018, the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) Chairman Naresh Kumar announced on Friday. "The stress will be on segregation of waste at source, composting of organic waste and recycling so that minimum possible garbage reaches landfill sites," Kumar said.
