The Indian Air Force on Sunday rescued a pregnant woman, newborn twins and their mother from a flooded village in Gujarat. The village was inaccessible through roads due to heavy rainfall and floods. An official said a Chetak helicopter reached the location within 45 minutes of receiving the evacuation request and flew them to a medical team waiting for them.
