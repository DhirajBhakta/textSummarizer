According to reports, the Mamata Banerjee-led West Bengal government has decided to enter the liquor distribution business amid a revenue crunch faced by the government. A government-owned corporation will distribute Indian-made foreign liquor and country liquor across the state. Notably, the state government has allowed bars in three-star hotels and above to serve liquor for 365 days in a year.
