CBI has filed a case against a Delhi-based company for using cheap China-made parts passed off as German-made in the production of indigenised Bofors guns used by the army. 
The CBI alleged that the company entered into criminal conspiracy with some officials to supply duplicate spare parts. 
Later tests found the bearings unacceptable due to deviations in dimensions.
