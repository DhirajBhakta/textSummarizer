Speaking on the issue of cross-border aggression by Pakistan, Home Minister Rajnath Singh said the Indian Army has been given the permission not to keep a record of bullets if Pakistani forces fire even one bullet. "Pakistan is trying to disturb peace and tranquillity in J&K time and again, but this practice will not continue for long," Singh added.
