Textile traders in Surat on Tuesday called off their two-week-long strike against the imposition of 5% tax on textiles under the GST regime. 
This comes after Finance Minister Arun Jaitley assured them that the GST Council will discuss this next month. 
The traders had shut their shops, resorted to stone-pelting and carried out a silent march against the tax.
