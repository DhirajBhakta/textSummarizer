A school principal in China's Linzhou city was suspended for holding exams for 400 students in an open playground despite closure orders amid a pollution 'red alert' across several parts of the country. 
The 'worst smog of the year' has reportedly affected over 46 crore people, with people being forced to either leave the affected cities or breathe toxic air.
