Passengers were stranded on Greek island Zakynthos for days after their easyJet plane developed technical difficulties on Sunday and a replacement plane couldn't fly in due to mating turtles. 
A flyer said there was no easyJet representative and passengers were forced to wait through "hours of nothingness." 
The airport has a night curfew to protect vulnerable loggerhead turtles breeding nearby.
