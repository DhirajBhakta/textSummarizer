The University Grants Commission has directed universities across the country to install alarm bells in hostels to keep a check on ragging-related activities. 
A circular issued by UGC also stated that if institutions fail to punish perpetrators suitably, it will attract punitive action. 
Notably, 288 ragging complaints have been received by the anti-ragging call centre so far this year.
