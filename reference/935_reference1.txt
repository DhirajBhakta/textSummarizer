42,000 reward for the recovery of two blocks of prize-winning cheddar cheese stolen from an agricultural show. 
The two blocks were stolen along with the certificates that prove their prize-winning quality which could raise their value. 
"It's a bit like having a valuable painting stolen," said cheesemaker Rich Clothier.
