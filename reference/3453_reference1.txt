As the SC on Friday upheld the decision to award death penalty to four convicts in the 2012 Nirbhaya gangrape case, the victim's parents said, "Justice was delayed, but not denied." 
While Nirbhaya's father said, "It's a victory for my family, I'm very happy with the judgement," her mother said, "This is not just our victory. 
This is everybody's victory."
