Less than a week after being appointed Chief Superintendent of Bengaluru Central Prison, R Anita was transferred reportedly over her non-cooperation with DIG Roopa's report on special treatment given to AIADMK Amma chief VK Sasikala. 
Anita who claimed that a senior official had directed her not to share CCTV footage from the jail, later shared an edited copy, reports said.
