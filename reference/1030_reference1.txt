Maharashtra Forest Minister Sudhir Mungantiwar on Wednesday told the Legislative Council that the government is planning to relocate tigers from Vidarbha region to sanctuaries where tiger population is smaller. 
He added that the deaths of most tigers happen due to territorial fights caused by over-population. 
A committee has reportedly been formed to examine the proposal.
