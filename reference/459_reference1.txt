Top Communist Party of China politician Sun Zhengcai, who was considered a potential successor to President Xi Jinping, is reportedly being investigated for corruption by his party. 
The probe against Zhengcai, who was recently ejected from his role as Party's Secretary for Chongqing city, eliminates him from the contest to become China's next President.
