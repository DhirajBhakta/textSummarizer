Schools in Kashmir reopened on Wednesday after a break of about eight months due to unrest in the Valley following the killing of Hizbul Mujahideen commander Burhan Wani and subsequent winter break. 
The government had ordered their closure after over 20 schools were torched by assailants during the unrest. 
Meanwhile, some schools in snow-covered areas will reopen on March 13.
