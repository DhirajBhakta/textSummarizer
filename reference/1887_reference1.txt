A young boy approached the head constable of a Hyderabad police station to file a complaint, claiming his grandmother was "torturing" him by restricting his playtime. 
The police said they gave his parents a counselling session, convincing the boy to withdraw his complaint after giving him chocolates. 
The police said it seemed the boy was inspired by TV serials.
