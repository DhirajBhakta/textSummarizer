The Ministry of External Affairs on Monday said that putting Lashkar-e-Taiba chief Hafiz Saeed on Pakistan's terror list was the first logical step towards bringing him to justice. "Hafiz Saeed is an international terrorist, the mastermind of Mumbai terrorist attack and responsible for unleashing wave of terrorism against Pakistan's neighbours through LeT/ JuD and their affiliates," MEA stated.
