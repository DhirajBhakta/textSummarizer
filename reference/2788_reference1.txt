Several pregnant women protested outside a government hospital in Telangana on Tuesday after being asked to go to a hospital located an hour's drive away. 
Reportedly, this was because there were no available gynaecologists to deliver the babies or offer medical treatment. 
The protest ended after the police reached the spot and the women received reassurance by the hospital's superintendent.
