A Chinese spy ship was spotted off the coast of Queensland during a joint war exercise between Australian and US forces, the Australian Defence Force (ADF) said on Saturday. 
Adding that the spy ship remained outside Australia's territorial waters and did not interfere with the operation, ADF said that the ship did enter the Australian Exclusive Economic Zone.
