Kerala Youth Congress suspended the party's workers who organised a protest wherein they slaughtered a cow in public in Kannur on Sunday. 
The workers also distributed the cooked meat to people. 
"What happened in Kerala yesterday is thoughtless, barbaric and completely unacceptable to me and the Congress Party. 
I strongly condemn the incident," Rahul Gandhi said in a tweet.
