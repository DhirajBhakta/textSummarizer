The RSS has asked people to chant a mantra five times every day before starting prayers, to "hurt" China's interests. "Kailash, Himalaya, aur Tibet Cheen ki asuri shakti se mukt ho (Kailash, Himalaya, and Tibet be delivered from the demonic clutches of China)," says the mantra. The group said that the mantra will "create positive action".
