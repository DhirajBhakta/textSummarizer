The Indian Air Force is preparing a security web with the Israeli SPYDER air defence missile system on the borders with Pakistan to tackle any aircraft, cruise missile or drone that tries to violate Indian airspace. 
SPYDER is a low-level, quick reaction missile to neutralise hostile targets up to 15 km away and at heights between 20 and 9,000 metres.
