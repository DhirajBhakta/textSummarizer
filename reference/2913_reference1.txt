The Narendra Modi-led NDA government has repealed 1,200 obsolete laws in its three years in power, compared to 1,301 laws being removed in the 65 years prior to that. 
The laws include one which states that an inspector in Andhra Pradesh must have well-brushed teeth. 
Another 200-year-old repealed law allowed the British monarch to review decisions of all Indian courts.
