The National Zoological Park in New Delhi may soon launch an animal adoption scheme, according to reports. 
Citizens would be able to adopt an animal after paying a fixed amount of money, usually spent on food and medicines for the animal. 
The adopter would have free entry for a year and their name will be displayed on the cage.
