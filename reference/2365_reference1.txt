Two militants have reportedly been killed today in an ongoing encounter with security forces in terror outfit Hizbul Mujahideen's slain commander Burhan Wani's hometown Tral in South Kashmir's Pulwama district. However, Inspector General of Police Muneer Khan said, "Till the time we do not recover bodies and weapons, we can't confirm it."
