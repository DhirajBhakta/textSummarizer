An RTI reply has revealed that AIADMK leader Sasikala was allowed 23 prison visits over the past 4 months, instead of the stipulated eight, according to reports. This is allegedly in violation of the prison rules which state that convicts can be allowed only one visit in a fortnight. Sasikala met around 48 visitors during these visits, the reports added.
