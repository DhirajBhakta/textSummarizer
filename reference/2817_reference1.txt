China on Wednesday launched its biggest new generation destroyer weighing 10,000 tonnes as part of a massive expansion of its navy. The country's first new generation destroyer is equipped with new air defence, anti-missile, anti-ship and anti-submarine weapons. This comes after China recently launched its first domestically built aircraft carrier amid North Korea's nuclear threats to the US.
