The Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (GJM) has given the Centre 10 days to intervene in the ongoing agitation for the separate state of Gorkhaland, failing which it threatened to intensify the protests. "An indefinite shutdown is going on for the last 47 days. The Centre can't just sit idle when the hills are burning," GJM leaders said.
