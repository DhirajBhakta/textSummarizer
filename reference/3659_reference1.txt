Hashim Sofi, a Kashmiri scholar at Birla Institute of Technology & Science (BITS), Pilani in Rajasthan, has left the institute after facing alleged threats and abuses. 
Sofi alleged that some objectionable messages were written on his hostel room's door and on his T-shirts, which were kept in the balcony. 
"Anti-national Kashmiri pervert, no place for you," read a message.
