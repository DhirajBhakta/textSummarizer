The Uttar Pradesh Congress on Saturday released a booklet in Lucknow in which Kashmir was labelled as 'Indian-occupied Kashmir'. The booklet, released to target BJP-led NDA government on completion of three years, was released by Ghulam Nabi Azad and Raj Babbar. Congress leader Ajay Maken said it was a "printing error" and apologised for the same.
