Twenty-two-year-old jawan Roshan Kumar, who passed away in a road accident in Delhi last week, saved the lives of transplant patients by donating six of his vital organs. 
Roshan had suffered serious brain injuries in the accident. 
"Roshan is not at the border to protect the country. 
But... he served the nation by saving six lives," said his uncle.
