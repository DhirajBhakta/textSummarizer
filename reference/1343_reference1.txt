A homeless burglar brings his own food for cooking and takes showers during break-ins, US authorities have said. 
"The bad thing is, he trashed the house," an official said while referring to a break-in. 
The 33-year-old accused, Jacob Merchant, has been charged with three counts of burglary and two counts of breaking and entering.
