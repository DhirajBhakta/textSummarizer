Islam's third holiest site, the al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem, will be closed for Friday prayers for the first time in 17 years. 
This comes after three attackers killed two Israeli police officers near the mosque complex earlier in the day. 
All the three gunmen were killed and the area was cleared of visitors and closed, police officials said.
