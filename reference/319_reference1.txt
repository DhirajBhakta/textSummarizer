Thane Municipal Corporation has restarted Star Grade, an application to report potholes, after several complaints were made about the same. 
It was launched two years ago and had reportedly become popular among residents. 
However, the app was stopped over non-renewal of its maintenance contract. 
Residents can upload pictures of potholes on the app and alert officials to take action.
