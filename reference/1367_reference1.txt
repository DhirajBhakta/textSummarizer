The Delhi Police is using a new software, which accesses real-time data from its helpline and helps identify crime hotspots. 
Police can then deploy enough policemen at these places. 
"In a mega city, we believe a lot of crimes are predictable and can be curbed," said an official. 
The software will replace manual data gathering, which happens every 15 days.
