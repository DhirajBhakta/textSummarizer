An ambulance was stopped to let former PM Deve Gowda's car pass in Karnataka's Chikkaballapur on Tuesday. The ambulance, rushing an accident victim to a hospital, was initially given clearance, but later stopped near Gowda's car. "I am not a person to have any privileges...I am only a small politician. I did not see the ambulance at all", Gowda said.
