A Pakistani woman, Hijaab Asif, praised Indian External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj after the latter directed the Indian High Commission in Pakistan to issue Asif a medical visa. 
"@SushmaSwaraj What do I call you? 
Superwoman? 
God? 
No words to describe your generosity!" 
she wrote in a tweet, adding that Pakistan would have changed if she were their Prime Minister.
