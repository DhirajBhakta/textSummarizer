The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation has formed 'Special 360' team to tackle spreading of dengue in the city. 
The team will visit areas with highest number of dengue cases across 24 wards to check mosquito breeding and to create awareness. 
This comes after 59 patients tested positive for dengue at city hospitals between June 1 and July 15 this year.
