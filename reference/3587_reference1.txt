Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia tweeted on Friday that the birth and death anniversaries of eminent personalities will cease to be public holidays in the national capital. 
The move follows a similar decision taken by the UP government, wherein 15 public holidays celebrating famous people's births and deaths were cancelled. 
The list of cancelled holidays will be released later.
