A 35-year-old motorcyclist was injured on Friday as a 'manja' (kite string) slit his throat on the Geeta Colony flyover in Delhi. 
The man was taken to a hospital where he was declared out of danger. 
Notably, the National Green Tribunal had recently banned "manufacture and use" of non-biodegradable 'manja', saying it posed a life-threat to birds, animals and humans.
