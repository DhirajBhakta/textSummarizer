Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain has said that Delhi residents can now avail free MRI, PET and CT scan at 21 private laboratories. 
People will only be required to show a referral letter from the selected government hospitals or state-run polyclinics to avail the facility. 
These tests are considered costly but Delhi government is making them free, he added.n
