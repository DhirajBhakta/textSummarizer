The Delhi police receives nearly 72,000 blank calls every day with some callers dialling the helpline numbers over 50 times "by mistake", said a senior police officer. 
The police has reportedly prepared a list of such callers who "harass" the control room personnel with repeated calls and have sent it to the Department of Telecommunication for a solution.
