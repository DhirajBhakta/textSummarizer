A senior official of Border Guards Bangladesh (BGB) has claimed that cattle smuggled from India is harming Bangladesh's economy and formally requested BSF to stop it. 
The official added, "If it [cattle] doesn't come from India, then our dairy farmers can go up and we can take care of ourselves." 
This issue was raised during the BSF-BGB Border Coordination Conference.
