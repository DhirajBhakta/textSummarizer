A 26-year-old who has been sitting on an indefinite hunger strike for nearly 10 days for Special Backward Classes quota got married at the protest site in Rajasthan. Devraj Gujjar continued with his "fast unto death" after the rituals while his wife left with her in-laws. Meanwhile, his wife said she would join him if the demands were not met.
