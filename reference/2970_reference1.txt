Enforcement agencies recently discovered that genitals of big monitor lizards were being smuggled and sold as "lucky charm" for better sex life and fertility in men. Madhya Pradesh Special Task Force busted the racket in Indore and Khargone arresting three traders and a priest. They seized 68 pieces of the body part, some of which were smeared with vermillion.
