India's biggest prison, Tihar jail, does not have a hangman on its payroll, according to reports. 
There is no official record of any executioner even though the post has existed in the prison manual ever since its construction in 1957, the report added. 
Notably, the jail currently has 19 prisoners on death row, which is the highest to date.
