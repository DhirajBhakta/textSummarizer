The Indian Railways is exploring self-propelled train sets similar to those used in the Delhi Metro, senior officials have said. 
Experts claim the technology will achieve faster acceleration of up to 160 km per hour and feature advanced protective measures like electro-pneumatic braking systems. 
A prototype, currently under construction, will begin trial runs next year.
