The pilot of the Jet Airways Goa-Mumbai flight that skid off the runway has written an open letter responding to criticism. 
"I love [my profession] to death, but...if I meet my end in my line of work, it's most likely that I'll be blamed," he wrote. 
He also requested media and public not to judge pilots for one mishap.
