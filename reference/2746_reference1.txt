Hoardings demanding independence by Khalistani separatist groups have emerged at various places in Punjab. 
The hoardings carried slogans like 'Azadi Hi Hal (solution), Punjab Independence 2020 Referendum'. 
Calling for the removal of the hoardings, State Secretary of the BJP in Punjab Vineet Joshi said, "It is a sinister attempt to disturb the peace and harmony of Punjab by anti-national forces."
