Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan, whose party LJP is a part of the NDA alliance, has told the Opposition they shouldn't waste their time as there's no vacancy for the Prime Minister's post till 2024. 
"People like Nitish, Mulayam and Lalu can never be one. 
They should stop wasting their time in looking for a prime ministerial candidate," he added.
