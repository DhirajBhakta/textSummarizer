Sacked FBI Director James Comey has revealed that he took notes of his conversations with President Donald Trump after their meetings as he thought Trump might lie about their discussions. 
Comey, who was leading an investigation into allegations of Russia's interference in the US presidential elections, also confirmed that Trump has never been under investigation.
