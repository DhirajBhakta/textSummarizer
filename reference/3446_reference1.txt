While the Supreme Court upheld four Nirbhaya gangrape convicts' death penalty, the juvenile convict in the case now works as a cook at a dhaba in South India. 
The exact location of his place of work has not been disclosed, fearing a threat to his life. 
The juvenile was released in 2015, after completing the three-year sentence awarded to him.
