The police on Saturday arrested a builder who was the prime accused in the gang rape of a teenage girl in Delhi's Jamia Nagar, from Bijnor in Uttar Pradesh. 
The arrest comes after the girl's mother was allegedly shot by two unidentified bike-borne men. 
There are four other accused in the case and all of them are on the run.
