Anjali Lama, who is the first transgender model to walk at the Lakm? Fashion Week, said that she has heard that yoga guru Baba Ramdev claims he can change gay people to straight. 
"He can keep trying but that's never going to happen," added Anjali. 
However, she added that she is fond of the affordable products from Ramdev's Patanjali brand.
