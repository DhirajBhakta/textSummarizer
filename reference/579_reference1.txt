A Gurugram district court on Monday reportedly sentenced a blind banker to 10 years in jail for allegedly raping a blind widow repeatedly on the pretext of marriage. 
Reportedly, the accused also pleaded for leniency on account of his blindness, but the court rejected it. 
The court relied upon 'voice identification' to help the woman identify the accused, reports said.
