A 27-year-old Bangladeshi named Abul Bajandar, dubbed the "tree man" for the bark-like lesions over his body, regained use of his hands after undergoing at least 16 surgeries for the treatment of one of the rarest diseases. Around five kilograms of growths were removed from his body, who is one of only four people to be diagnosed with epidermodysplasia verruciformis.
