The Supreme Court on Friday exempted people with physical disabilities from its recent ruling of making it mandatory for everyone to stand during the National Anthem to be played compulsorily before film screenings in theatres. The apex court further clarified that the doors of the cinema halls will be closed, but not bolted when the National Anthem is played.
