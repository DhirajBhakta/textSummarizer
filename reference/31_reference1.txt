Abu Ismail, mastermind of the Amarnath Yatra attack, will reportedly replace Abu Dujana as the Kashmir division chief of Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT). 
Dujana was killed by the security forces on Tuesday after a seven-hour gunfight in south Kashmir's Pulwama district. 
Notably, eight pilgrims were killed and 18 were injured in the Amarnath Yatra attack last month.
