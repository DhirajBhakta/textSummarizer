Doctors at Apollo Hospital, Delhi cured a 13-year-old boy suffering from perpetual jaundice. In this rare condition, the liver does not produce an enzyme needed to break down a yellowish by-product of body's processes. The boy had to spend 12-15 hours per day under blue lights to help break it down, leaving liver transplant as the only option, doctors said.
