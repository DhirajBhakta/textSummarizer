Indian-origin businessman Harnish Patel (43) was found dead of gunshot wounds outside his home in USA's South Carolina on Thursday. A Lancaster County police official said, "I don't have any reason to believe that this was racially motivated." This comes days after an Indian engineer was killed at a bar in Kansas, USA, in a hate crime shooting.
