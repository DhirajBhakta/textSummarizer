A sinkhole swallowed two houses and a boat in Florida, United States. Police said they were called after someone noticed a depression had formed under a boat parked outside a house, and "the hole opened up" within minutes. The residents had left for work, and firefighters managed to rescue two dogs and retrieve some belongings. nn
