UP CM Yogi Adityanath has directed the officials to paste teachers' pictures on the walls of state-run schools to cross-check from the students whether those teachers, whose pictures were displayed, attend schools regularly and teach or not. Some teachers in these schools use proxies to teach while they themselves draw hefty salaries without doing any work, he said.
