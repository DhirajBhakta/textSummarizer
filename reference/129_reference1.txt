Canada is investigating reports that Saudi Arabia has been using Canadian-made armoured vehicles against its citizens in the violence-hit Eastern Province. 
Videos and photos posted on social media show Saudi Arabia using Canadian equipment on Shia dissidents. 
Canada warned it would take action if "it is found that Canadian exports have been used to commit serious violations of human rights".
