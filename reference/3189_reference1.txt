A Nepal Army plane crashed on Tuesday, killing the pilot and injuring two crew members, during an emergency landing triggered by bad weather, reports said. The aircraft carrying food supplies overshot the runway by about 50 metres and crashed in a field. This is the second accident involving a cargo aircraft in less than a week in the country.
