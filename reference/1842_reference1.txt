Five months after the death of Sarvanan Ganeshan, a 26-year-old junior resident doctor of AIIMS, which was thought to be a suicide earlier, a murder case was registered last week in the case. 
Someone had forcefully injected a medicine in his right forearm and Ganeshan could not have done so, as he himself was right-handed, reports said.
