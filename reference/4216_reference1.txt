Key accused in the Sheena Bora murder case, Indrani Mukerjea, on Thursday told a CBI court that she would oppose her son Mikhail's claim on Sheena's share of ancestral property. 
Indrani's mother, who died in 2015, had in her will left a piece of land, a two-storied house and two other structures in Guwahati for Sheena and her brother Mikhail.
