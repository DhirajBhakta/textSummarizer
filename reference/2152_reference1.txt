Pope Francis has slammed media organisations that focus on scandals and promote fake news and said people who consume such content are "coprophagic", or faeces-eaters. He added that spreading disinformation is "probably the greatest damage that the media can do". Earlier, US President Barack Obama had slammed online misinformation as a threat to democratic institutions.
