A bag used by US astronaut Neil Armstrong to bring moon dust samples back to Earth was sold for $1.8 million (?
11.58 crore) at an auction in New York on Thursday. 
After the Apollo 11 mission, the bag was stolen from Houston's Johnson Space Center before being found years later. 
The bag reportedly still contains traces of moon dust.
