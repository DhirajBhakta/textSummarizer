A recent video of Lashkar-e-Taiba co-founder Amir Hamza has reportedly been recovered showing Hamza provoking jihadis to wage war in the northeastern states of India. "We will fight in Sikkim...we will fight in Srinagar," Hamza allegedly said in the video. He was even heard saying if India sends troops to Bhutan, then Chinese troops will enter Srinagar along with Pakistan's.
