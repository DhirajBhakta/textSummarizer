China on Saturday said there is "no room" for negotiations to resolve the military face-off and the only solution is the withdrawal of Indian troops from the Doka La region. 
Adding that the situation could get "worse", China's state-run Xinhua News Agency said that India will face "embarrassment" if it does not withdraw its border troops to its own side.
