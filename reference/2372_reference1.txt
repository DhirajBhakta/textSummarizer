A rare 60-kg sperm whale on Thursday washed ashore at Rajodi beach near Mumbai. The fishermen said that the seven-and-a-half-foot-long mammal looked injured and died during rescue operation. "This species of whale has not washed ashore along the state's coastline for more than a decade," said a member of the Konkan Cetacean Research Team.
