An Indian Army team has participated in a tank race competition in Russia along with 18 other countries. 
This is the third time India participated in the event but it's their first with own T-90 tanks. 
The competition simulates actual battlefield conditions involving challenges like high-speed driving and switching from one mode of operation to another at a fast pace.
