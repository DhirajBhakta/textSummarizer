Air India Chairman Ashwani Lohani on Wednesday sent a WhatsApp message to Air India staff, including senior officers, asking them to carry their own hand baggage. 
Lohani, who called the move "in line with the PM's drive towards simplicity in public life," will also carry his own baggage. 
Henceforth, only MPs and unwell staff can request help with luggage.
