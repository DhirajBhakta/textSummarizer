A Child Rights Commission in Tamil Nadu has recommended blocking People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals website alleging that they carry sexually explicit advertisements and content. 
Social activist Enoch Moses said in his petition that when children searched for information on PETA on the internet, they were directed to images of nude models and ads carrying double meaning quotes.
