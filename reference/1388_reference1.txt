Bana Alabed, the seven-year-old girl who tweets about the war in Syria, has written an open letter to United States President Donald Trump. The letter says, "You must do something for the children of Syria because they are like your children and deserve peace like you." Alabed, who was recently evacuated to Turkey, has termed Aleppo the "city of death."
