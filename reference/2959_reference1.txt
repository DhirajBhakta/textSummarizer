Gorkhas demanding a separate state protested outside Delhi's Jantar Mantar on Sunday, as the strike by Gorkha Janmukti Morcha in Darjeeling entered its eighth day. 
Hundreds of protesters gathered at the monument, with national flags and banners that read, "We want Gorkhaland". 
Meanwhile, Home Minister Rajnath Singh appealed to people to remain calm and peaceful, and not resort to violence.
