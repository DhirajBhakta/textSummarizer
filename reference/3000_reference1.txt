The Red Fort with the Indian tricolour was shown as Lahore's Shalimar Gardens under a Pakistani tableau at a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation banquet in Beijing on Wednesday. 
The mistake was pointed out by both Indian and Pakistani diplomats. 
Following this, SCO officials apologised saying they failed to cross-check the photos as this was the first event involving India and Pakistan.
