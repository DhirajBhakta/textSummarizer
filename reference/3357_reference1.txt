The Uttar Pradesh government is considering to make Saturdays 'no school bag day' in the state-run schools. 
As per the proposal, the school kids would be allowed to come to school without school bags so that they can enjoy the creative activities. 
Earlier, the government had decided to replace the khaki dress in state-run schools with a new uniform.
