The telecom companies operating in the Kashmir Valley have been instructed to bring down the speed of internet from 3G and 4G to 2G in the region with immediate effect. This comes after terrorists attacked a CRPF convoy, leading to the death of two jawans. The terrorists had later taken shelter in Srinagar's DPS school.
