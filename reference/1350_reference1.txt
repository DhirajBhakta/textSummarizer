The Centre's Yamuna Water Taxi Services, which would ferry tourists from Palla at Delhi-Haryana border to Wazirabad, may start operations by June this year. The aim is to promote tourism, reduce travel time between the two points from 3.5 hours to 45 minutes and keep burden off the roads. "Yamuna upstream... has the 'required depth' for navigation," said an official.
