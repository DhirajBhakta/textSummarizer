Andhra Pradesh Finance Minister Y Ramakrishnudu on Wednesday said that demonetisation has reduced the state's revenue by 30%, but hoped that the implementation of Goods and Services Tax might help increase the government's income. Adding that people have faced problems due to note ban, Ramakrishnudu said the government will need to take measures to sustain the revenues and economic growth.
