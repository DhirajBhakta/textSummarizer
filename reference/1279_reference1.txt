A study by the Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology claims that an earthquake more catastrophic than the one experienced in 2015 in Nepal could hit parts of North India soon. 
The study of tectonic plate movement has revealed that the Indian Plate is moving towards the Eurasian Plate at 45 millimetres per year, building pressure under the region.
