The owner of a gym in Australia discovered that a snake was living in her gym for two days. 
It had fallen from the ceiling after finishing a meal. 
The owner came to know about the snake's presence after she was informed by the gym cleaner. 
"He was really well behaved actually because he was so full," said the owner.
