An activist has launched an online petition to save over 1,700 trees in Delhi's Pragati Maidan from being cut down. 
This comes after an RTI response revealed that the Delhi Forest Department had allowed cutting the trees to construct an exhibition centre. 
Activists have already raised concerns that 15,000 trees were felled in the Capital over the last three years.
