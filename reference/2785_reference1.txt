Around 500 GST officials in Mumbai are working in an office with leaky roofs and no electricity. A chunk of the ceiling of a Deputy Commissioner's cabin collapsed while he was working six feet away. Further, the conference room's ceiling collapsed, while one part of the building has no electricity. Officials also reportedly work on computers with umbrellas open overhead.
