A student of IIT Madras, who ordered a new mobile phone through e-commerce firm Snapdeal, has reported that instead of the mobile phone, she found a brick inside the parcel. The girl, who paid 12,000 for the product, said she contacted Snapdeal and registered a complaint. An executive from the company said he would enquire into the issue.
