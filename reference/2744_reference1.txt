BJP President Amit Shah on Sunday addressed a public meeting at Goa International Airport, following which a lawyer filed a complaint terming it a "gross abuse of power." Hundreds of people including Goa CM Manohar Parrikar attended the meeting, which was right outside the airport. A congregation of people outside airports is barred by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation.
