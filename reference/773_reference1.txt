There has been a 60% shortfall in the release of central funds to Assam for flood management, according to a Comptroller and Auditor General report. The centre was supposed to release over 2,000 crore between 2007-08 and 2015-16 but provided only 812 crore. It further added that the state government released only 16% of the allocated budget for flood management.
