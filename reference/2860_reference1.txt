Union Home Secretary Rajiv Mehrishi has said that lynching or hate crimes are not something new in India while adding, "I think they are overhyped and over-reported." However, Mehrishi added, "A crime is a crime and should be handled with strictness, fairness." Recently, Deputy SP Mohammed Ayub Pandith was lynched in Srinagar by a mob.
