A prolonged drought in Italy may lead to water rationing as the country faces its driest spring in 60 years, reports said. 
Water supply shutdowns could last as long as eight hours daily as some parts of the country received rainfall totalling 80% below normal, officials said. 
The drought could reportedly lead to Rome's famed fountains being turned off.
