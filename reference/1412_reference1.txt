Three friends Amol Sawant, Shrungar Raul and Pervez Shaikh from Mumbai have formed 'Anstrengung United', an NGO which trains about 200 needy children in sports. Their journey started with befriending four street children, who were getting addicted to drugs. They started gathering these four children every day to play football and gradually convinced their parents to send them to school.
