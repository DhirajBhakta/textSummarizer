Islamic preacher Zakir Naik's passport was revoked on Tuesday by the Regional Passport Office of Mumbai. 
The travel document was revoked after he failed to respond to a show cause notice that directed him to appear in person by July 13. 
Naik is wanted by the National Investigation Agency on charges related to terrorism and money laundering.
