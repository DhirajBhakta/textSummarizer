The official website of Noida's Galgotias University was hacked on Tuesday and pro-Pakistan slogans were posted on its home page. 
The website, which remained hacked for an hour-and-a-half, had hate messages and slogans such as 'Pakistan Zindabad', 'ISI Zindabad' and 'India Banee gaa PAKISTAN'. 
The issue was resolved internally and the website was restored by the university's IT cell.
