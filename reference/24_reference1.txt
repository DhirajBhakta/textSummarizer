Two sunbathers, a 56-year-old man and an eight-year-old girl, were killed on Wednesday when a light plane struck them while making an emergency landing at a beach in Portugal. 
The others had run into the sea to save themselves. 
The two occupants of the plane, which appeared to be in difficulty and had a partly broken left wing, were unhurt.
