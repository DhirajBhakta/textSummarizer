The Supreme Court on Friday rejected a PIL seeking an all-India ban on cow slaughter, stating it will not interfere with state laws on the killing of cattle. 
"One state may ban slaughter, the other may not," the apex court observed. 
The court, however, said it has already passed orders on measures to stop the illegal inter-state transportation of cattle.
