Republican Senator Lindsey Graham has said that US President Donald Trump has told him they would rather go to war to destroy North Korea than allow it to develop nuclear-armed missiles. 
Adding that he prefers a diplomatic approach to solve the North Korean threat, Graham claimed, "There is a military option. 
To destroy North Korea's programme and North Korea itself."
