Delhi was officially announced as the capital of British Raj by the then-Emperor George V, on December 12, 1911. 
The capital was shifted from Calcutta as Delhi was the financial and political seat of many earlier empires and was located closer to the geographical center of India. 
The rising nationalist movement in Calcutta was also responsible for the shift.
