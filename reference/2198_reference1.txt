Naresh Kumar, the main accused in the Junaid lynching case, was sent to judicial custody by a court. 
This comes after Kumar was in police custody for five days during which police tried to recover key evidence in the case. 
All six accused in the lynching are already in jail and will be produced before the court on July 25.
