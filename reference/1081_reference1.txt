The British-era Bawana Jail is one of the 19 monuments being renovated by the Delhi Archeology Department. 
The abandoned 19th-century structure, which has also served as an orphanage and school, was once used to imprison revenue defaulters and villagers who failed to pay the Zaildari tax. 
It resembles a fortress and features an arched gateway.
