The Delhi High Court has said undue sympathy towards convicts by awarding inadequate jail term "undermines public confidence in efficacy of law" while upholding a 10-year-long term awarded by a trial court to a man for rape. 
Dismissing the man's plea for reduction of his punishment, Justice SP Garg said awarding inadequate sentences are a "serious threat" to society.
