The number of daily visitors at Choolannur peafowl sanctuary in Kerala has gone up from 10-12 to 200-300 after a Rajasthan High Court judge said that peahens get pregnant by drinking the tears of peacocks. 
"Once the peahen shows her willingness, the peacock mounts on the peahen and fertilises the eggs through muscular spasms," the foresters explain to the visitors.
