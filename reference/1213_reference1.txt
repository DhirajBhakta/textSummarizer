The world's oldest working steam locomotive in regular operation, 162-year-old Fairy Queen, has been re-inducted into service by the Indian Railways. The train took its first journey in five years on Saturday, travelling from Delhi Cantonment to Haryana's Rewari. Constructed in 1855 by Kitson, Thompson, and Hewitson in England, the Fairy Queen was brought to Calcutta (now Kolkata) in 1855.
