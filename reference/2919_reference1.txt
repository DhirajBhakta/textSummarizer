Richard Evans, son of a co-owner of the company whose vehicle was used in the recent London mosque attack, has been arrested over a Twitter post. 
He had tweeted, "it's a shame they don't hire out tanks," after the attack. 
Evans was arrested "on suspicion of displaying threatening abusive statement with the intent to stir up racial hatred", police said.
