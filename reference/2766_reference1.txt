A Delhi-bound IndiGo flight carrying 174 passengers was evacuated within 60 seconds at Patna Airport on Friday after smoke was detected in its cabin, the airline said. 
IndiGo said the incident was caused due to a "suspected engine stall." 
BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi and Union Minister Ram Kripal Yadav were stuck at the airport because air traffic was suspended.
