Shiv Sena MP Ravindra Gaikwad, who has been banned by several airlines, has reportedly made attempts to book Air India flight tickets by altering the spellings of his name. 
"Ravindra Gaikwad, R Gaikwad, Prof V Ravindra Gaikwad and Prof Ravindra Gaikwad has been banned in our system as he tried booking using different abbreviation," an Air India official said.
