The Jallianwala Bagh massacre took place in Amritsar on April 13, 1919, wherein thousands of people in a public protest meeting were fired upon under the command of Brigadier-General Dyer. 
While British officials declared 379 deaths in the massacre, the Indian National Congress estimated over 1,000 deaths. 
Dyer stated that the firing was to 'punish the Indians for disobedience'.
