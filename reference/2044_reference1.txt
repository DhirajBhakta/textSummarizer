Reacting to the meeting between President Pranab Mukherjee and Tibetan spiritual leader Dalai Lama last week, China has said that it is "strongly opposed" to such engagement which would have a "negative impact" on Indo-Sino relations. 
"We urge the Indian side to see through the anti-China separatist nature of the Dalai Lama clique," the Chinese Foreign Ministry stated.
