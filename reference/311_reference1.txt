The Bengaluru-based firm which was carrying out on-screen assessment of answer sheets has said that the Mumbai University results were delayed because the varsity didn't provide them with a consolidated list of evaluators. 
The university, however, said that it had given them a list of 10,000 evaluators and it was the firm's job to consolidate it into the desired format.
