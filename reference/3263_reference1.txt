An Indian cab driver in Australia has been hospitalised after allegedly being beaten up and racially abused by a couple. The driver alleged that he was attacked after warning the female passenger not to open the cab's door to vomit repeatedly. The husband then attacked him from behind and kicked him, calling him a 'bloody Indian' and 'f***ing Indian.'
