A 9-year-old South African child has become only the third known case worldwide to show signs of AIDS virus' long-term remission without any drugs. 
The child was given anti-AIDS medicine for 10 months till the age of one which helped lower HIV levels from "very high" to undetectable. 
The kid was then taken off drugs as part of a trial.
