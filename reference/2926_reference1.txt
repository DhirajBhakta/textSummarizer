The Supreme Court on Wednesday denied interim bail to former High Court judge CS Karnan, who was sentenced to six-month jail term for contempt of court. 
The vacation bench of the court said it cannot modify the original order passed by the seven-judge bench and asked Karnan's lawyer to present the case before Chief Justice of India after the vacation.
