A Supreme Court bench has said that women sacrificing their love for parents is common in India. 
The bench was setting aside the life sentence of a man who had made a suicide pact with a woman after secretly marrying her in 1995. 
The woman's suicide bid was successful, while the man survived and was convicted for her murder.
