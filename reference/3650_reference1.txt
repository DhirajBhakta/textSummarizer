According to the latest newsletter by Oxford University, students who avoid making eye contact with their peers could be guilty of racism. 
The University's Equality and Diversity Unit has advised students that "not speaking directly to people" could be deemed a "racial micro-aggression". 
It also stated "jokes drawing attention to someone's differences" is a potential form of "everyday racism".
