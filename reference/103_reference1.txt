The Jharkhand government on Tuesday cleared a draft anti-conversion bill which aims to ban religious conversion through force or allurement. Anyone found guilty of forced conversion will be liable to a punishment of three years in jail and/or a fine of 50,000. Individuals voluntarily opting to change religion will need to inform local authorities about reasons for the conversion beforehand.
