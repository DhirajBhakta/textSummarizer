Israeli researchers have successfully tested a technology using fluorescent bacteria and lasers that offer a safer way to detect buried landmines. Researchers estimate that around 100 million landmines left from previous conflicts, scattered in 70 countries injure up to 20,000 people a year. The mines release vapours, smelling which the sprayed bacteria glow and get detected by lasers.
