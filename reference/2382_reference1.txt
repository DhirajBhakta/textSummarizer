Former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's name has been removed from the Oxford India Centre for Sustainable Development which was named the Indira Gandhi Centre for Sustainable Development at its launch during the tenure of UPA government. 
The Centre was established by Somerville College in the University of Oxford in 2013 where Indira Gandhi studied Modern History in 1937.
