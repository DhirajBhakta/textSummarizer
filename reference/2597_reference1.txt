US President Donald Trump has accused former FBI Director James Comey of leaking classified material by passing a memo of their private conversations to media and called his act "illegal". 
Earlier, the media had reported that Comey, who had been sacked by Trump, shared the private memos containing classified information on meeting Trump. 
However, the reports were later retracted.
