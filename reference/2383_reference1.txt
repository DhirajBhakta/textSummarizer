The Bombay High Court on Thursday cautioned the state government against demands to relax noise pollution rules during the Ganpati festival and Navratri. 
The state government was told that they cannot go against the High Court judgment which does not allow loudspeakers or other sound amplifiers in a silence zone at any hour of the day.
