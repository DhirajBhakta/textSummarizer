RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav on Thursday asked his party workers to tie old, non-milking cows outside the houses of BJP leaders to see if they really cared for the animal. "Even if the BJP leaders beat you with sticks, bear it and do not resist. We need to show if they are really concerned about cow service," Lalu added.
