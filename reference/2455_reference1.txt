The Centre on Wednesday told the Supreme Court that it may enact a new law to provide jail terms or fines for heads of NGOs which misappropriate government funds or do not file annual statements. 
Earlier in April, the Supreme Court had asked the Centre to examine enacting such a law, saying that merely blacklisting NGOs is not sufficient.
