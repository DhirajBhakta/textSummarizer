A Tamil Nadu couple went to attend a wedding after dropping their 17-year-old daughter at a herbal hospital and found her dead body in a freezer box kept at their doorstep on returning. 
The girl was being treated for epilepsy and weight loss at the hospital. 
Further, people have accused the hospital's owner of having no authorisation from medical bodies.
