Farmers from a village in Maharashtra have lodged a police complaint against the Meteorological Department for giving a wrong seasonal forecast. The farmers accused the department of colluding with seed and pesticide manufacturers and inflating the monsoon forecast figures. They said they spent lakhs of rupees in the sowing process as the IMD forecasted ample rains in this Kharif season.
