A 14-month-old girl's dead body was pulled out from an open borewell after 58 hours of rescue operation. 
The toddler was playing with her elder sister when she accidentally fell into the nearly 450-foot-deep open borewell in a village near Hyderabad on Thursday. 
The police called off the rescue operation at 6 AM on Sunday after her remains were retrieved.
