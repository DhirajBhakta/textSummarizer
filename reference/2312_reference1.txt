The Bombay High Court on Friday criticised the Maharashtra government for the 'pitiable' and 'ridiculous' condition of its residential schools in tribal areas. 
Nearly 800 children have died over the last ten years in these schools due to negligence. 
The state was directed to provide students basic facilities such as clean drinking water, mattresses, healthcare, and toilets.
