The US House of Representatives on Tuesday voted 419-3 to approve new sanctions on Russia for its interference in the 2016 presidential elections, despite President Donald Trump objecting to the legislation. 
The bill would also levy new sanctions against North Korea and Iran over the nations' ballistic missile programs. 
White House officials said they are reviewing the bill.
