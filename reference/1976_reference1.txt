The Government has decided to provide an additional grace period of 60 days to farmers whose crop loan dues fall due between November 1, 2016 and December 31, 2016. Further, if such farmers repay the same within 60 days with effect from the date on which the repayment was due, they will be eligible for prompt repayment incentive for 2016-17.
