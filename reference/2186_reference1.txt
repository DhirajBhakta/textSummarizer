Science and English were added to the competency tests for classes 6 to 8 in schools across Maharashtra. The subjects were added after a report revealed that only 62.5% class 5 students could read English and 20.3% knew division. The tests, which were launched in 2015, are aimed at assessing basic skills of students from classes 1 to 8.
