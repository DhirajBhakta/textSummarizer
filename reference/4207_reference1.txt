For the first time in the history of AIIMS, its emergency and OT services were closed on Friday as around 5,000 nurses went on mass casual leave demanding higher pay. 
While around 90 surgeries were postponed, several patients were forced to visit other hospitals. 
The nurses have also threatened to go on an indefinite strike from March 27.
