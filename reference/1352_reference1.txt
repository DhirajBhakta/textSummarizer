Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday said that the advancement of Budget presentation to February 1 and the Rail Budget being incorporated into it is the beginning of a new tradition. 
"Everyone would remember that earlier budget used to take place at 5 pm. 
This practice was changed during former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's time," Modi added.
