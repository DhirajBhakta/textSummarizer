The Restaurant of Order Mistakes in Tokyo only employs waiters with dementia, and diners can expect to receive the wrong order. 
The restaurant aims to raise awareness of mental illness and show that people with dementia can be productive members of society. 
A food blogger who ordered a burger but received gyoza said the meal was still "delicious."
