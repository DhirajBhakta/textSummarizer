The Madhya Pradesh Cabinet on Tuesday decided to grant the status of "living human entity" to Narmada river. 
Earlier, Home Minister Rajnath Singh had asked the state government to introduce a bill in the Assembly. 
The proposal to grant the status to Narmada river came after the Uttarakhand High Court accorded the status to Ganga and Yamuna rivers.
