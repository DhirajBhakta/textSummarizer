The Bombay High Court today asked all people opposing the destruction of mangroves for Metro rail project to be practical. 
"There was a need for Metro. 
The traffic in Mumbai is becoming bad to worse," the HC said. 
"Metro should've been in Mumbai 30 years ago. 
You (the government) are doing it 30 years later," it added.
