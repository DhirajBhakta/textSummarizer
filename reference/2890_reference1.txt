A Russian national was selling his photographs in Delhi to earn money and continue travelling across India. Kola sat in Connaught Place next to a placard saying, "Hello. I'm from Russia. These photos are from my travel. Price up to you. Support my trip." Kola was staying in a hostel, and wished to visit Kashmir.
