Seven school students in Mumbai got injured after they cut themselves with a pencil sharpener blade as part of a dare, according to reports. 
Even though all the students were bleeding profusely from the cuts, they did not tell anyone. 
When the students came with bandages on their hands the next day, the school felt something amiss and questioned them.
