Pope Francis' chief financial adviser and third-highest Vatican official Cardinal George Pell was charged with multiple sexual assault offences on Thursday. 
He is the highest-ranking Vatican official to be charged in the church's long-running sexual abuse scandal. 
Pell, accused of touching two boys inappropriately in a pool in the 1970s, has denied the allegations and vowed to "clear his name."
