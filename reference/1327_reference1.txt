A new cafe called Energy Cafe has been inaugurated at Vidyut Bhawan, headquarters of the Bihar State Electricity Board, in Patna. 
It has been furnished with junk and scrap materials, including oil drums, connection transformers and an old Ambassador car that now serves as a sofa. 
It will soon be open to electricity department staffs, IT supervisor Mahfooz Hashmi said.
