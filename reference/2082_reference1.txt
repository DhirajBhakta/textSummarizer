The Al Ponte caf? in Amsterdam, Netherlands provides discounts to residents in return for plastic wastes. 
The initiative is part of a pilot project named 'Wasted', which incentivises households to recycle their plastics. 
For every bag of plastics, households earn one green coin which can be used for a free second coffee.
