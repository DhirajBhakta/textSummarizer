A leopard on Friday attacked and injured a twelve-year-old boy while he was coming back with his friends from Mumbai's Aarey pump house. 
This is the fifth incident of a leopard attack in the last five months. 
Authorities have reportedly set up two cages to trap the leopard and expect that it will be trapped within the next few days.
