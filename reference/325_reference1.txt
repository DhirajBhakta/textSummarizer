Canadian PM Justin Trudeau was slammed after he explained why he had fought an indigenous politician in a boxing match in 2012. 
Trudeau recalled in an interview that he decided to fight politician Patrick Brazeau since it was "the right story to tell". 
"So 'privileged white guy beats up Indian' was the 'right kind of narrative?' 
Seriously?"
