Residents of Bandra's D'monte Street said they will file a criminal complaint against the authorities for demolishing a 120-year-old cross on April 29. 
"We want the BMC to reinstate the cross. 
The criminal charge-sheet is for wrongly marking the shrine and demolishing it," they said. 
Residents also said that the cross was legal and was on the owner's private property.
