Unidentified dead bodies are spotted floating almost daily in the Tigris river near the recently ISIS-liberated Iraqi city of Mosul, according to reports. The bodies are the evidence of extrajudicial executions of ISIS militants by the Iraqi security forces, non-governmental organisation Human Rights Watch has alleged. Soldiers have shifted the corpses to a morgue at the city's general hospital.
