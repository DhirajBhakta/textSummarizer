The lawyer representing 1993 Mumbai blasts convict Abu Salem has argued that he cannot be sentenced to death or to jail for over 25 years under a treaty with Portugal. Salem was brought back under the treaty after he was detained in Portugal in 2002. The lawyer also said Salem's detention period should be counted as 15 years already served.
