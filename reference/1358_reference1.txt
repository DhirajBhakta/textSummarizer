External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj has sought a report from the Indian Embassy after a 53-year-old Indian was arrested at a US airport for allegedly making a bomb threat. 
The airport was evacuated and operations resumed after no bomb was found. 
Swaraj intervened after his wife contacted her on Twitter, claiming that he was falsely implicated.
