A self-styled email prankster, known as @SINON_REBORN on Twitter, has fooled recently-fired White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci thrice. The prankster fooled Scaramucci by posing as recently-fired Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, as a Russian envoy and finally as one of his friends. The prankster said he targeted Scaramucci because he had used mental health issues as a "put down".
