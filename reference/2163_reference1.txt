KFC New Zealand has launched limited-edition candles that smell like KFC fried chicken. The fast food chain also launched a competition on social media, offering its winner a fried chicken-scented candle. Meanwhile, earlier this year, KFC launched an edible nail polish in two variants, namely 'Original' and 'Hot & Spicy,' in Hong Kong.
