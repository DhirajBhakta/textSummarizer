National Conference President Farooq Abdullah on Tuesday apologised to the people of the country for the attack on Amarnath pilgrims and said that those killers were not Muslims. He further said, "I want to tell you that we are not the ones who kill people. Even today, when a yatri comes here, it's the Kashmiri Muslim who carries his baggage."
