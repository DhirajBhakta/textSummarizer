Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi accused Chhattisgarh's ruling party BJP of killing Dalits, tribals and small traders for the sake of power. Gandhi went on to term BJP as the "party of lies" and urged his party functionaries to defeat BJP with Congress' "power of truth". He advised party workers on how to effectively use social media to mobilise support.
