According to the book titled 'Shattered: Inside Hillary Clinton's Doomed Campaign', Hillary Clinton phoned her presidential election opponent Donald Trump to say "congratulations, Donald" after her loss. 
She added, "I'll be supportive of the country's success, and your success as president". 
Clinton also called former President Barack Obama and apologised to him for the loss, the book revealed.
