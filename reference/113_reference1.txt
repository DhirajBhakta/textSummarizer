The Goa government on Tuesday told the state legislative assembly that strict action would be taken against people found drinking on state beaches and that they could even be arrested. "The beaches should be clean and there should not be any illegality on them," Goa's Tourism Minister Manohar Ajgaonkar said. "We will not mind arresting them, if required," he added.
