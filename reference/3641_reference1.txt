The CRPF on Monday said "considerable number" of Naxals are believed to have been killed in retaliatory action during an attack at Chhattisgarh's Sukma district in which 25 CRPF personnel were martyred. 
About 300-400 Naxals had ambushed the patrol party while two companies of the 74th battalion were out providing security to people engaged in constructing a road.
