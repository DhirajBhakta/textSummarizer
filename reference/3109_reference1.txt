Indian Army chief General Bipin Rawat on Tuesday reportedly said that all options are open against Pakistan's aggression along the Line of Control (LoC) and the international border. 
His statement comes as tensions continue to simmer along the India-Pakistan border, with several ceasefire violations being reported in recent months.
