Researchers have developed self-propelled microbots that remove disease-causing bacteria from water. 
The "two-faced" spherical bots have a magnesium side which reacts with water to produce hydrogen bubbles to propel them. 
The other face with gold traps bacteria which are then killed by the silver nanoparticles with an 80% efficiency. 
The bots can be easily removed from water using a magnet.
