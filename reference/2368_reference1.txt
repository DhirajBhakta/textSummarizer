The Prime Minister's Office has denied information on various expenses incurred on foreign trips by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his predecessor Manmohan Singh. 
A PMO official said that the RTI was denied on grounds of being "too vague and wide". 
Reportedly, the RTI petitioner had sought copies of all files and letters exchanged between the PMO and different offices.
