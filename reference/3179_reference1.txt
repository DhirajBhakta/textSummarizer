Scientists are building the world's first wind farm powered by giant kites in the UK. The kites would fly at 300 metres high in loops generating power via a tether connected to a generator. Scotland-based company Kite Power Systems has successfully tested a 40-kilowatt version. The company plans to build ten 500-kilowatt systems by 2020 that would power 5,500 homes.
