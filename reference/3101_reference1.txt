A goat in UP chewed up currency notes worth 66,000 while his owner was bathing on Monday. Farmer Sarvesh Kumar Pal, who raised an alarm but managed to save only 4,000, said people have suggested he sell the goat to a butcher. However, Pal and his wife said, "We can't be cruel to our pet. It's like our own child."
