Union Minister Kiren Rijiju on Tuesday said the government has undertaken construction of 73 roads of 'operational significance' along Indo-China border. 
Out of the 73 roads, 46 are being constructed by the Defence Ministry and 27 by the Home Ministry. 
This comes while India and China are engaged in a standoff after China attempted to construct a road in Doklam.
