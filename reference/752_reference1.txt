RSS-BJP affiliated think tank Bharat Niti has reportedly planned to raise a dedicated unit of people that will protect and promote Hinduism online. The group has also planned a 'Hinduism and Social Media Conclave' in November, where they would discuss ways to promote Hinduism through "high-tech means". Notably, Yogi Adityanath has been invited as the chief guest of the event.
