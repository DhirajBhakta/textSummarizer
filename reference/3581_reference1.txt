The International Islamic University in Islamabad, Pakistan has issued a notice prohibiting girls in the hostel from sharing beds. 
It instructs students to keep a distance of at least 2 feet between their beds and warns them of a fine in case they're "found sharing bed with...friends or sisters". 
The order also bans girls from sitting on the same bed.
