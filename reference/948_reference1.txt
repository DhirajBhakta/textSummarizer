Pakistan's Supreme Court on Monday began hearings on the Panama Papers case against Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. This comes after the SC-appointed Joint Investigation Team (JIT) panel found the country's leader guilty of financial irregularities including tax evasion. The court is expected to put Sharif on trial on corruption charges or disqualify him, however, Sharif has denied any wrongdoing.
