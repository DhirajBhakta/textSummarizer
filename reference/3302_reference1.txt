India received the first artillery guns after the 1980s Bofors scandal on Thursday, as two of the 145 M777 ultra light artillery guns ordered from the US arrived ahead of schedule. 
The guns will be tested at the Pokhran field firing range in Rajasthan today. 
Out of the 145 guns, 120 will be assembled in India, by Mahindra Defence.
