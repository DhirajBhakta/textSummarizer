Phoebe, an eight-year-old girl from the UK, has offered to say 'bong' instead of Big Ben's chimes for a BBC radio show, during the renovation of the 157-year-old clock. 
She wrote a letter to a BBC editor, who replied through a letter. 
The letter stated, "That's an awful lot of work for someone who is still quite young."
