A 95-year-old widow of an Indian Air Force pilot, who died in a plane crash in 1962, waited 55 years to get the due special pension. 
In 2004, her appeal got rejected, saying her husband had already availed the insurance benefits. 
A military court finally gave her the special pension, which is for widows of officers who died on duty.
