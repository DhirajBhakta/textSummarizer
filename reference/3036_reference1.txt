The Indian Air Force has dismissed a pilot and sentenced him to two years' imprisonment for assaulting his senior, refusing to eat and stealing remotes from the officers' mess. The officer had suffered a knee injury in 2013, following which he was declared unfit to fly a transport aircraft. He has previously claimed his superiors harassed him following his injury.
