An increasing number of women in Iran have been refusing to wear hijab while driving, sparking a nationwide debate about whether a car is a private space. 
Notably, Iranian women are obliged to wear hijabs in public. 
However, President Hassan Rouhani has argued that people's private space should be respected, opposing a crackdown on women who do not wear hijab.
