Archaeologists on Saturday unearthed a two-metre high, centuries-old statue believed to have been the symbolic guardian of an ancient hospital at the Angkor temple complex in Cambodia. 
The statue is believed to date back to the late 12th to early 13th century. 
Angkor was the capital of the Khmer Empire, which dates from the 9th to the 15th centuries.
