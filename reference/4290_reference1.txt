World's oldest known crocodile eggs laid some 15.2 crore years ago have been discovered in Portugal. 
The crocodile ancestor from the late Jurassic era is believed to be two metres long based on the size of the eggs. 
The eggs found during excavations of a dinosaur nest near Lisbon extends knowledge of eggs by four crore years, said a palaeontologist.
