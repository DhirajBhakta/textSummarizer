To monitor drivers who don't stop buses at designated stops, the Delhi government has decided to install CCTV cameras at various bus stops. 
Transport officials said that skipping bus stops is a common practice among drivers of the government-run buses. 
It not only creates congestion on roads, but also poses difficulty for senior citizens and differently abled among others.
