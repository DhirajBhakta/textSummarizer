A panchayat in Pakistan's Punjab province has asked a man to rape a 16-year-old girl in front of her family as punishment after her brother was accused of raping the man's sister, police said on Wednesday. The same act should be repeated with the accused's sister as justice, the village council claimed. Police arrested the head of the panchayat.
