The Mumbai railways is planning to introduce a software which will help commuters book tickets through Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD) codes. 
The software will make use of SMS services, which will allow commuters without smart phones to book tickets. 
Kiosks to aid the service are being installed across 10 railway stations as part of the project's pilot stage.
