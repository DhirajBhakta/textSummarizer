Mumbai Metro One on Wednesday announced plans to launch India's first mobile ticketing system by mid-August for easy commute. 
Commuters will reportedly be able to buy tickets using the Mumbai Metro app, which will generate a QR code that can be used to get access through automated fare collection gates. 
However, tickets will continue to be sold over the counter.
