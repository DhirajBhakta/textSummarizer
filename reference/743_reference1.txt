Delhi civic bodies have decided to construct stack parking lots next to 10 Delhi Metro stations, with six such parking lots to be constructed in north Delhi, three in south Delhi and one in east Delhi. The parking facilities will reportedly be open to the visitors as well as the residents living in the neighbourhood areas.
