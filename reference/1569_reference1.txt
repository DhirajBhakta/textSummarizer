Army Chief General Bipin Rawat on Sunday said that the jawans who take to social media to express their complaints could be punished as their act lowers the morale of those guarding the frontiers of the country. 
This comes after a BSF jawan had posted a video on social media alleging the poor quality of food served to the soldiers.
