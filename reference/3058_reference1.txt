West Bengal's capital Kolkata will get India's first underwater metro system, which will pass through the Hooghly river. 
One of the two tunnels has been completed and is built 30 metres below the earth's surface, near the Howrah Bridge. 
Notably, this is the first time in India that a tunnel has been made under a flowing river.
