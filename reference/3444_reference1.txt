Over 100 students of Rani Jhansi School in Delhi's Tughlakabad were on Saturday admitted to the nearby hospitals due to gas leak from a container. 
"Students complained of irritation in eyes and throat due to the gas leak," said the school's Vice-Principal. 
While the source of the leak is unclear, seven fire department teams have been sent to the spot.
