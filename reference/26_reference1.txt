The US Air Force on Wednesday successfully launched an unarmed intercontinental ballistic missile from California, the fourth such test this year. The test will show the readiness and effectiveness of the weapon system, officials said. The launch comes amid concerns over North Korea which recently tested two intercontinental ballistic missiles which it claims has the range to reach the US.
