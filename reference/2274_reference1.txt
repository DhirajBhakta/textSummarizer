The UN on Friday said that over 8 lakh people out of nearly 10 lakh who fled Iraq's Mosul after the offensive against Islamic State began, still remain displaced. 
UN officials in Iraq said the new displacement figures underscored "the enormous crisis" in the area. 
Notably, Mosul was recaptured from ISIS earlier this month by US-backed Iraqi government forces.
