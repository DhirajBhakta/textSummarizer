Pakistan will be releasing 439 Indian fishermen and will send them back to India in two batches, a Pakistani peace activists group said on Friday. It added that discussions must be held to release the fishing boats as they are the only source of fishermen's livelihood. This comes amid a complete halt in bilateral talks between India and Pakistan.
