A man has accused the staff of The Wine Company pub at DLF Cyber Hub, Gurgaon, of beating his friends. 
He said after sorting out "inconsistencies" in the bill, they were leaving the pub when the manager stopped them due to a "misconception". 
The bouncers then beat up his friends and also "broke several bottles on them", he alleged.
