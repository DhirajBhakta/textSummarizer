Two Sufi clerics of the Hazrat Nizamuddin Dargah in Delhi, who had gone missing in Pakistan last week, have returned to India after External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj intervened into the matter. 
The duo, that went to pay obeisance at the shrine after returning, blamed a Pakistani newspaper for publishing a misleading article that had led to the entire fiasco.
