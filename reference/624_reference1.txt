The Noida authority has reportedly decided to name all lanes in villages under its jurisdiction for identification purposes and for improving civic facilities. 
The lanes of Jhundpura village will be reportedly named first. 
Officials said that villages cannot be ignored because "all areas are interconnected" and poor civic amenities in villages affect urban areas too.
