Officials of India and Bangladesh on Thursday agreed to construct gates along the border to allow free and safe passage for wild elephants. 
Officials have identified 12 points in Meghalaya and one in Assam along the border where fences would be pulled down to build gates. 
The initiative would also permit transboundary movement of elephant rescue teams.
