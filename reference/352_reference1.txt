The Delhi Police will reportedly get around 30 sniffer and explosive-detection dogs in a month from the Indian Army Veterinary Corps. 
The dogs will help police deal with security challenges in the Capital, reports said. 
Delhi hosts several high-profile events which attract anti-national elements and so security of these venues is a top priority, a police official said.
