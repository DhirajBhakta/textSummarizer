The Rajasthan Gujjar Aarakashan Sangharsh Samiti has demanded separate reservation of 5% within Other Backward Class quota, reports said. 
In 2015, the Rajasthan government had provided 5% reservation for  Gujjars, Banjaras, Gadia Lohars, Gadarias and Raikas under Special Backward Classes, taking the total reservation in Rajasthan to 54%. 
However, the Rajasthan High Court struck down the move.
