During a speech in Madhya Pradesh on Wednesday, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat said every person born in India is a Hindu. 
"Even Muslims are Hindus by nationality, they are Muslims by faith only," Bhagwat added. 
"Just as the English live in England, Americans in America and Germans in Germany, Hindus live in Hindustan," Bhagwat  further said.
