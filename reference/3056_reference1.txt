A day after initiating a fast over the farmers' agitation in the state, Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Sunday ended his fast. Chouhan ended his 'peace fast' almost after 28 hours with coconut water. Earlier, the relatives of five farmers killed in police firing during the Mandsaur protests had asked Chouhan to discontinue his fast.
