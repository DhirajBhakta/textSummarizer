An engineer working for an electricity distribution company died in Delhi's Jaffarpur Kalan on Monday, after his car hit a tree while he was allegedly being chased by a mob during an anti-power theft raid. 
The company said its teams were chased by bike-borne goons and added that they had received a tip about large-scale power theft in the area.
