The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has denied a Ganesh mandal coordination committee's demand to take the approval process for setting up mandals online. 
The committee claimed that the single-window clearance system which was introduced in 2015 to improve mandal approval rate was ineffective. 
Reportedly, it will now meet Mayor Vishwanath Mahadeshwar to demand a better clearance system.
