Bombay High Court senior lawyer Yug Chaudhry has written a petition addressed to the President of Pakistan seeking mercy for former Indian Navy officer Kulbhushan Jadhav who has been awarded death sentence for allegedly spying. 
Chaudhry filed a similar petition in October 2012 seeking mercy for Pakistani terrorist Ajmal Kasab who was awarded capital punishment by various courts of India.
