Water supply to Ghaziabad and Noida will be temporarily disrupted because of silt deposit in the Upper Ganga Canal, caused by heavy rains in Uttarakhand. 
An official from Ghaziabad's water treatment plant said, "The issues of low supply and disruption will persist for some days. 
The water supply to the plant is low and it will decrease further by Friday."
