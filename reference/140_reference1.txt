Pakistan has extended the house arrest of UN-designated terrorist and Mumbai terror attack mastermind Hafiz Saeed for another two months to maintain public order. 
Liberty of Saeed is a continuous threat to the peace and tranquillity in the country, Pakistani authorities said. 
The Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD) chief has been under house arrest since January 31 this year.
