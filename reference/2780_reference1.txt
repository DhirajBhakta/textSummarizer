Model Gigi Hadid has said she cannot pull off the clothes that singer Rihanna can. 
"[B]ut she makes me excited about getting dressed... which is inspiring," she added. 
Gigi further said the best fashion tip she has received is if she doesn't know what to wear to a party, she should just wear jeans, a T-shirt and heels.
