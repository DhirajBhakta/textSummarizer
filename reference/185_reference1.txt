A 190-year-old temple in Mumbai's Byculla has installed a 37.5-kilowatt rooftop solar system with 115 panels which will enable it to cut down its annual electricity bill by ?
8 lakh. 
The temple management will reportedly install more panels by the end of this year. 
Notably, about 20 religious institutions in Mumbai have switched to solar power.
