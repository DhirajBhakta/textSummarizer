Launching 'Ude Desh ka Aam Nagrik' (UDAN) scheme on Thursday, PM Narendra Modi said, "My dream was to see a person who wears a 'hawai chappal' (slippers) to fly on the 'hawai jahaz' (aeroplane)." 
"The lives of the middle class are being transformed...Earlier, aviation was considered to be the domain of a select few. 
That has changed now," he added.
