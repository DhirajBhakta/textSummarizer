Malayalam news channel Mathrubhumi has announced a 'First Day of Period' leave for its female employees. 
The additional leave will not be counted under sick leave, and will soon be extended to the company's online and print ventures. 
"We felt that it was a very good and practical practice to adopt. 
And so the decision was taken," the company said.
