RJD supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav on Wednesday offered BSP chief Mayawati a Rajya Sabha seat from Bihar to "fight against atrocities and divisive agenda of BJP". 
This comes a day after Mayawati resigned as a Member of Parliament in Rajya Sabha in protest claiming that she was not allowed to speak in the House.
