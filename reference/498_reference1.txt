Attorney General KK Venugopal on behalf of the Centre said in the Supreme Court, "Privacy is part of Right to Life, but does not enjoy the status of a fundamental right." 
He added, "Since right to privacy consists of diverse aspects and it is a sub-specie of liberty, every aspect of the sub-species will not qualify as a fundamental right."
