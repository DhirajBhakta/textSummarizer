Mumbai police have registered an FIR against an unidentified Mumbai man for allegedly uploading photos of a woman's face morphed onto a nude body to a fake Facebook profile. 
After the profile was blocked, the man reportedly created another and uploaded the same pictures again. 
The man had allegedly threatened to take revenge when the woman rejected his advances earlier.
