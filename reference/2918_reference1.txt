The Pakistani Army has said that it will soon begin building a fence along its volatile border with Afghanistan to improve security. Adding that a secure border is in the common interest of both the countries, the Army said that border posts will also be built to enhance defence and surveillance along the frontier. However, Afghan authorities opposed the move.
