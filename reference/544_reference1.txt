A Polish man was killed after a teenage boy hit him with a "superman punch" that caused him to fall and hit his head on the ground, a court has heard. 
The accused reportedly punched the deceased for mocking his English accent. 
The victim was knocked unconscious and later died in hospital from head injuries.
