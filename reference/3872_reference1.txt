Tamil Nadu farmers on Monday ran naked near PM Narendra Modi's office, demanding ?
39,000 crore drought relief fund from the Centre. 
Reportedly, this comes after they were promised an appointment with Modi but were not allowed to meet him later. 
These farmers have been sitting on protest since almost a month, holding skulls in hands and live mice in mouths.
