Starting from April 1, Railways will let waitlisted passengers travel in the next alternative train going towards the same destination the ticket is booked for. 
Passengers will be allowed to take Rajdhani or Shatabdi trains even if they booked a ticket for other mail or express trains. 
No extra charge or difference in the fare will be collected by Railways.
