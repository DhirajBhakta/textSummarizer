Despite protests by China, Tibetan spiritual leader Dalai Lama on Tuesday arrived in Arunachal Pradesh and was greeted by chanting of prayers, music, and religious flags. 
The Nobel Laureate will reach Tawang on April 8 for a three-day stay. 
The visit is opposed by China which considers Arunachal Pradesh to be a part of southernmost Tibet.
