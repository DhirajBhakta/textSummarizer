The Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) is planning to introduce a second underground metro in the city by extending the Wadala Metro 4 route by 8 kilometres, up to General Post Office. "The corridor will be taken underground wherever we can't make it elevated. A detailed report is expected in September," MMRDA officials said.
