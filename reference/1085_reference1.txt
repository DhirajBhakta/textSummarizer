In a campaign named "Break the Bloody taboo", NGO Sacchi Saheli will conduct sessions on menstruation for girls in 70 Delhi government schools. 
"Usually lessons on menstruation are imparted to girls by their mothers who unfortunately also pass on superstition, stigma and fear surrounding the natural bodily process," explained Surbhi Singh, a gynaecologist who is roped in for the campaign.n
