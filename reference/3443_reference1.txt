Information and Broadcasting Minister Venkaiah Naidu on Friday asked the Jammu and Kashmir government to immediately stop the broadcasting of Pakistani and Saudi Arabian TV channels in the state. 
As per reports, over 50 Saudi and Pakistani channels, besides Zakir Naik's Peace TV and others indulging in anti-India propaganda, were allegedly being broadcast in Kashmir via private cable networks.
