Jet Airways pilots' body National Aviator's Guild reportedly held an emergency meeting on Wednesday to chalk out an "action plan" after Delhi Police questioned pilots for allegedly sharing "obscene" WhatsApp messages about DGCA officials. 
An NAG member claimed DGCA did not inform the pilots of the issue beforehand while Delhi Police did not conduct a "preliminary inquiry" before questioning them.
