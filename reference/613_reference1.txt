UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson likened a traditional Maori greeting, hongi, to a head butt while visiting indigenous leaders in New Zealand. 
He said hongi which involves two people pressing their noses together "might be misinterpreted in a pub in Glasgow". 
Boris is visiting New Zealand as Britain aims to strengthen ties with it in preparation for Brexit.
