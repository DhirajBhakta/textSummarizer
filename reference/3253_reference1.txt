A professional hunter from South Africa died on Friday after an elephant he was hunting fell on top of him. 
The deceased, 51-year-old Theunis Botha, was with a group of hunters when an elephant picked him up. 
One of the hunters then shot the elephant, which collapsed on top of Botha and crushed him to death.
