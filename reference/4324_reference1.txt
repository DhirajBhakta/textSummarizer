A statue of a young girl staring down the bronze Charging Bull came up on Wall Street, New York ahead of International Women's Day on Wednesday. 
'The Fearless Girl' statue says, "Know the power of women in leadership. 
SHE makes a difference." 
It was installed by State Street Global Advisors to encourage companies to increase the number of women directors.
