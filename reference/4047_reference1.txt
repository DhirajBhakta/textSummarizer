A woman, who was arrested twice last week for trying to jump the White House fence, has been arrested for the third time for scaling a fence at the Treasury Building, next to the White House. 
The woman, who told officers that she wanted to speak to President Donald Trump, has been charged with unlawful entry and contempt of court.
