As many as 70 live bombs have been recovered from a drum and a bag in West Bengal's Birbhum district. Two more live crude bombs were recovered from Asansol. The police prima facie believe the bombs were placed to spread terror in the village. There are no lead suspects yet, and no arrests have been made.
