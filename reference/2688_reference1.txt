Prime Minister Narendra Modi shares a connection with the ties between India and Israel due to a date acting as a coincidence. India had officially recognised Israel as a nation on 17 September 1950, allowing the latter to open its consulate in Mumbai. Coincidentally, it was also on the same date that PM Narendra Modi was born in Gujarat's Vadnagar.
