Passengers and cabin crew got into an argument on Tuesday after a Delhi-Bengaluru SpiceJet flight was repeatedly delayed. 
Passengers, including children, reportedly sat inside the aircraft for hours while no reason was given for the delay. 
The flight was scheduled to depart at 8:55 pm, while passengers were reportedly accommodated on a different aircraft that departed at 12:25 am.
