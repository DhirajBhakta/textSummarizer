US President Donald Trump on Wednesday said that his proposed wall along the US-Mexico border will need to be transparent so that people on the US side do not get hit by massive sacks of drugs being tossed over it. 
Trump earlier proposed attaching solar panels, saying the panels would provide cheap energy to pay for the wall.
