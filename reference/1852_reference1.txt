Quashing his detention under the Public Safety Act, the Jammu and Kashmir High Court has ordered the immediate release of separatist leader Masarat Alam Bhat. 
He was arrested in 2010 for leading a mass agitation in which 120 people were killed. 
Alam was released in 2015, but was rearrested for allegedly raising pro-Pakistani slogans and hoisting Pakistani flags.
