Monorail services were disrupted on Saturday evening in Mumbai after a train stopped functioning due to a power failure, following which authorities deployed another to tow it away and rescue stranded passengers. 
Pictures of the two trains, which seemingly came face-to-face, led to speculations that a head-on collision was averted but authorities denied reports of two trains nearly crashing.
