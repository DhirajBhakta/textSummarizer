Several women are taking to Instagram to post pictures of 'feather eyebrows', which involves separating the eyebrow hair so that there is a parting running through the middle of the brow. 
The trend was reportedly started by Finnish makeup artist Stella Sironen. 
She wrote in a post that she had started the trend as a 'joke'.n
