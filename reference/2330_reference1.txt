Three British Sikhs have been jailed for a total of 19 years for helping 69 illegal Afghan immigrants enter into the UK by misusing passports in an estimated £620,000-scam. Once the immigrants got into the UK, the gang recycled the passports, passing them on to others trying to enter the UK illegally.
