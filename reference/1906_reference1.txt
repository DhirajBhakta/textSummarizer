Regional Transport Offices (RTOs) in Delhi are set to go cashless from January 2017 and fees for all services including driving licence, auto permit and fitness certificate can be paid electronically. 
The Transport Department has started installing PoS machines at its zonal offices and the trial run of the cashless transaction system is being carried out at some places.
