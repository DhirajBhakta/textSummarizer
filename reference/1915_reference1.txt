The prices of about 50 drugs, including those used for treatment of HIV infection, diabetes, and bacterial infections, have been capped by the government, leading to a price cut in the range of 5-44%. 
In respect of medicines not under price control, manufacturers are allowed by the National Drug Pricing Regulator to increase the maximum retail price by 10% annually.
