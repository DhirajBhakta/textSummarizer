Three members of a gang have been arrested for wearing khaki uniform and posing as policemen to rob people in Delhi. The gang dressed as policemen would reportedly check the target vehicle's documents, rob the occupants at gunpoint, and then throw them outside at an isolated stretch of road. Two other members of the gang are still on the run.
