Former Arunachal Pradesh CM Kalikho Pul's wife Dangwimsai Pul on Thursday withdrew her Supreme Court petition seeking a CBI-probe into the allegations made in his purported suicide note. 
She said she did not want the court to decide her matter as that "will lead to closure of other remedies". 
Notably, Pul was found hanging at his official residence in August.
