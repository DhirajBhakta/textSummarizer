A restaurant owner in Italy has been offering families a 5% discount if their children are well-behaved. Antonio Ferrari, who does not have children of his own, estimated that about 30% of parents do not know how to handle their children at lunchtime. However, the 40-year-old said he was not being judgemental, adding, "I imagine how difficult parenting is today."
