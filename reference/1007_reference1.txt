Less than 3,000 out of 36 lakh eligible farmers have opted for an interim loan of 10,000 in Maharashtra. The state had offered the interim loan to facilitate sowing of kharif crops until the actual farm loan waiver was announced. Noting poor response to the interim waiver scheme, advertisements were also published in newspapers, urging farmers to avail the loan.
