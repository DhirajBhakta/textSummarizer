The Women and Child Development Ministry is setting up cradles at police stations, hospitals, and orphanages across the country where parents can leave their child for adoption. 
Cradles will be accompanied by a bell to notify the authorities at the premises. 
WCD Minister Maneka Gandhi called it a 'humane and anonymous method' for parents to put babies up for adoption.
