A six-year-old orphan boy was allegedly sexually assaulted multiple times by three staffers of a yoga ashram in central Delhi. 
Reportedly, the boy was being victimised for a long time and the incident came to light after an ashram counsellor was informed about it. 
One of the accused allegedly thrashed a counsellor when he was questioned about the abuse.
