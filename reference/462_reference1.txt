Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has threatened to bomb tribal schools, accusing them of teaching students to rebel against the government. Duterte condemned insurgents for destroying infrastructure and alleged that the schools were operated by the rebels without government permits. Human rights groups demanded that Duterte retract the threat and warned such an attack would be a war crime.
