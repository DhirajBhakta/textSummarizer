Gujarat Deputy Chief Minister Nitin Patel's son Jaimin was prevented from boarding a Greece-bound Qatar Airways flight on Monday after he allegedly arrived at Ahmedabad Airport in a "heavily drunken" state. 
Airport officials claimed Jaimin cleared immigration in a wheelchair and argued with Qatar employees. 
Denying the reports, his father said, "Our opponents are trying to tarnish our image."
