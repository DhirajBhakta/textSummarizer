Pakistan Peoples Party chairman Bilawal Bhutto has warned US President Donald Trump's administration against including Pakistan in the list of banned nations, saying such a move will create a "host of hostilities" between the two countries. 
Earlier, White House hinted that Pakistan could be included in the list and Pakistani visitors are subject to "extreme vetting" under existing US regulations.
