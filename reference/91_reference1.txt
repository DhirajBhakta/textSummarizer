Gurugram police on Saturday midnight rescued twenty people who were trapped in a mall lift for nearly 90 minutes. Police said that two out of six women fell unconscious in the lift due to lack of oxygen. Some trapped people had reportedly contacted the elevator control room, but the police were called when the staff couldn't fix the technical glitch.
