Raj Thackeray-led MNS has written letters to building constructors to stop discriminating against people on the basis of caste, creed, religion and even eating habits while selling flats in their buildings. 
Moreover, the MNS warned of intensification of their agitation if non-vegetarian people were denied flats by the builders. 
"[W]e may take law in our hands," an MNS spokesperson said.
