Saudi Arabia's King Salman on Wednesday ordered the arrest of junior Prince Saud bin Musa'id after videos purportedly showing him assaulting two men and pointing a rifle at another emerged online. 
King Salman also urged citizens to monitor the abuse of power. 
Notably, one of the videos shows 18 bottles of whisky even though Saudi Arabia forbids alcohol consumption.
