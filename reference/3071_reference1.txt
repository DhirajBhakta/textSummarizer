The Maharashtra government pleader on Friday informed the Bombay High Court it cannot find the notification classifying roads as state highways and other roads. 
Liquor vendors have filed petitions, alleging the excise department is not renewing their liquor license by claiming they are located on highways. 
However, the petitioners claim the outlets are located over 500 metres away from highways.
