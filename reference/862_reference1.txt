Noida authority officials on Monday demolished around thirty makeshift shops near Sector 78 after residents demanded for removal of 'illegal encroachments'. This comes after over 300 protestors, mostly domestic helps, gathered outside a housing complex last week, alleging that one of its residents had assaulted a domestic help. Noida authority has however claimed that it was a routine demolition.
