Social activist 'Traffic' Ramaswamy has filed a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) in the Madras High Court seeking late Tamil Nadu CM J Jayalalithaa's body to be dug out of the grave for post-mortem analysis. 
Asserting that the public has the right to know more about the AIADMK leader's death, he demanded an examination of CCTV footage from Chennai's Apollo Hospital.
