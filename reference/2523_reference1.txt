US President Donald Trump's nominee to lead the FBI, Christopher Wray, has rejected the President's claim that an inquiry into alleged Russian hacking of the US election is a 'witch hunt'. 
Adding that he will never allow the FBI to be driven by anything other than facts, Wray said he would quit if Trump asks him to do anything illegal.
