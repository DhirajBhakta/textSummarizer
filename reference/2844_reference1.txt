Delhi Metro Rail Corporation's first automated driverless metro trains are set to start operations from October this year on new Magenta Line from Janakpuri West to Botanical Garden. The new metro corridor, which has missed two deadlines in the past, would be partially thrown open to the public in October. Currently, test runs are being conducted for the driverless trains.
