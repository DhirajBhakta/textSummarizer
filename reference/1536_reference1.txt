A five-year-old Sikh boy has reportedly been denied school enrolment in Australia for wearing a turban as it does not align with its uniform policy. 
Notably, in a 2008 ruling, a Brisbane private school was forced to back down on a strict uniform policy that would have forced a Sikh boy to cut his hair and remove his turban.
