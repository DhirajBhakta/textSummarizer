Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday ordered his cabinet to attend a welcome ceremony for US President Donald Trump, after discovering that many of them planned to skip the event, reports said. 
Notably, Israeli officials have criticised the visit as "haphazard". 
Trump arrived in Israel on Monday in the second leg of his first overseas trip as President.
