Former JNU Students Union President Kanhaiya Kumar said, "Such is the environment of fear in India now, that if you do not use Patanjali face wash, then you will be called anti-national." 
Kanhaiya further said that various sections of society, including intellectuals, are living in fear. 
"If you demand reduction in fee, you will be labelled as anti-national," he added.
