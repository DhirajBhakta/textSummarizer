US President Donald Trump has reportedly consulted his advisers on how he can pardon himself, his family and his aides if they face legal action as part of the ongoing Russia probe. 
The probe is being led by former FBI Director Robert Mueller who vowed that his highest priority would be "to restore the public's confidence in the FBI".
