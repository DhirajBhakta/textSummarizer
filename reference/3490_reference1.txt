Amid rising tension after the mutilation of bodies of two Indian soldiers, the government has sent back a delegation of 47 Pakistani students. MEA spokesperson Gopal Baglay said an NGO had invited the students and their teachers as part of an exchange programme. The government advised the NGO that this is not the right time for such programmes.
