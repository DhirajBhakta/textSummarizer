Opposition's Vice Presidential candidate and Mahatma Gandhi's grandson Gopalkrishna Gandhi on Tuesday expressed his stand against death penalty and capital punishments calling them as medieval practices. 
Gandhi said, "Death penalty is wrong and this is my principle." 
Notably, Shiv Sena criticised him for a letter he wrote to the President in 2015, seeking clemency for a 1993 Mumbai blasts accused.
