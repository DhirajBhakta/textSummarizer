A Muslim reporter claimed that he was stopped by Bajrang Dal activists on a highway in Bihar, who asked him to chant 'Jai Shri Ram' or they'll set his car on fire. 
Munne Bharti wrote in a Facebook post that the men made him chant when they saw his wife wearing a nikab and his father sporting a beard.
