Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte on Monday offered self-rule to the country's Muslim minority in an attempt to defeat militants loyal to Islamic State who have besieged the city of Marawi for nearly two months. 
The government and Muslim insurgent groups have agreed that giving the mainly Catholic nation's Islamic minority self-rule is crucial for ending the lure of violent extremism.
