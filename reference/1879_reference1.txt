Archaeologists recently found evidence of a new tomb behind a 4,200-year-old wall unearthed in Egypt. 
The two-metre high wall has been found below a pathway in the West Aswan cemetery at Qubbet el-Hawa, and the hidden tomb is thought to hold an unknown ruler. 
The team will reportedly excavate the tomb further in April next year.
