The Indian Army on Thursday said its troops killed five Pakistani soldiers in retaliatory firing along the LoC in Jammu and Kashmir. 
This comes after an Indian civilian was reportedly killed and a BSF soldier was injured in ceasefire violations earlier in the day. 
Meanwhile, Pakistan summoned the Indian Deputy High Commissioner alleging that India killed Pakistani civilians.
