The buggy which Indian Presidents ride for the oath-taking ceremony originally belonged to the Viceroy of India during the British era. After the partition of India and Pakistan, both sides tossed a coin to decide who would get the buggy, and India won the toss. However, its use declined after 1984, and was started again by former President Pranab Mukherjee.
