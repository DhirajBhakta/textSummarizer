The World Bank has cleared a $250-million (over 1,610 crore) loan for making Indians more employable through re-skilling, under the government's Skill India mission. The programme is targetted at people between 15-59 years of age who are underemployed and unemployed. It also mandates the provision of entrepreneurship opportunities to women and to increase their exposure to skill training.
