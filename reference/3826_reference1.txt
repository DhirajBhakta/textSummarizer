Ex-Indian Navy officer Kulbhushan Jadhav, who has been sentenced to death in Pakistan for spying, has two options to challenge the country's Field General Court Martial verdict. 
He can appeal to the Pakistan's Military Appellate Tribunal or appeal in a civilian court for a review of the judgment. 
Earlier, Pakistan Defence Minister said Jadhav had 60 days to appeal.
