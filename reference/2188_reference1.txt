Over 80,000 children under the age of 5 in the Rakhine State of Myanmar are "wasting" and will need treatment for acute malnutrition, the UN has warned. 
Wasting is the condition of rapid weight loss which impairs the immune system. 
The food situation in the state worsened after a military crackdown that forced over 75,000 Muslim Rohingya to flee.
