The Bank of England on Tuesday unveiled a new polymer ?10 note featuring 19th century novelist Jane Austen, in a move to replace paper ?5, ?10 and ?20 with secure plastic notes. 
This makes Austen the only woman other than Queen Elizabeth to be featured on a polymer British banknote. 
The note's introduction marks the 200th anniversary of Austen's death.
