A lawyer acting for the woman who made rape allegations against WikiLeaks Founder Julian Assange has accused him of "violating" her client in the media. This comes after Assange released a public statement giving details of his relationship with the rape accuser. Assange said he released the statement because he wanted people to know "how abusive" the process has been.
