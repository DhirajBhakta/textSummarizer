A five-year-old girl was fined ?150 (?
12,500) for running a homemade lemonade stall in London last week, her father said. 
He said she cried after an enforcement officer "launched into a legalistic script" and accused her of trading without a licence after approaching them. 
The council later cancelled the fine, saying, "We expect our enforcement officers to show common sense."
