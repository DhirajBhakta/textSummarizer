The Maharashtra government has launched a scheme to cover medical insurance of up to 10 lakh of 335 sitting legislators, 837 former legislators, and their families. This is reportedly aimed at curbing the use of fake bills in the medical reimbursement scheme the legislators were covered under earlier. The insurance scheme will cost the state almost 10 crore a year.
