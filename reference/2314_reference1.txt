A Delhi judge noted the difference in punishment for killing cows and people, while sentencing a man for causing death by rash driving. ?
The sentence for killing cow is five, seven, or 14 years in different states, but the sentence for causing the death of a human being through rash or negligent driving is only two years,? 
he said.
