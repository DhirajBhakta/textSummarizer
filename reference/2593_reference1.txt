The dead bodies of two trekkers who went missing last week have been found by a rescue team at the Devkund waterfall in Maharashtra. 
The police reportedly sought to impose a curfew in the area to stop people from going for the trek. 
Over 145 people, including the Army and police, were involved in the 24-hour search operation, police added.
