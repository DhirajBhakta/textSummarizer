An allegedly drunk man on Friday strangled a street dog to death by standing on its neck and mouth for about an hour in Noida's Sector 45. "He was adamant to kill the animal, as it barked at him," an eyewitness who shot video of the incident said. Animals rights groups said they will lodge a complaint against the man.
