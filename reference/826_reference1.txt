Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath rejected 85-year-old 'Metro Man' E Sreedharan's resignation as the state's metro advisor, and handed him three more projects. The first phase of the Lucknow metro is ready, while plans for Varanasi have been made. "The UP CM now wants metros in Agra and Meerut too, along with Kanpur," Sreedharan said.
