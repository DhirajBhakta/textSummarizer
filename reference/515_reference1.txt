The Kannada Development Authority has directed the Bengaluru metro officials to remove all Hindi signs without waiting for the state government's instructions. 
The authority also said that even the announcements can't be made in Hindi. 
This follows protests from pro-Kannada activists against the Centre's tri-language policy, calling it as forceful imposition of Hindi on non-Hindi speaking states.
