Two people were injured after some residents in Ghaziabad opened fire at Panchayat members who were trying to settle a 'rape case'. 
Police said the accused had entered the house of a 20-year-old woman and allegedly raped her. 
Later, some Panchayat members suggested that woman's family should vacate the rented house, following which the landlord took offence and opened fire.
