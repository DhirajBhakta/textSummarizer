The Border Security Force (BSF) on Saturday handed over a 15-year-old boy on humanitarian grounds to Pakistan authorities after he strayed into the Indian territory. 
The boy, Razak Mai, reportedly crossed over the International Border from Punjab's Abohar sector by mistake and was apprehended on Friday. 
The BSF this year handed over six other Pakistani nationals who had crossed over.
