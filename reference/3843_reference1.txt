Reducing a man's life sentence to 10 years imprisonment in a case wherein he had set his wife on fire, the Bombay High Court said that "he only wanted to inflict burns and not kill her". 
The court also took note of the man's attempts to save his wife by throwing water on her and rushing her to a hospital.
