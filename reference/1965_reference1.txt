The police on Tuesday arrested the alleged mastermind, Arjun Thapa, in the Munirka double murder from Agra. 
His interrogation also led to the recovery of the severed head of one of the two women, whose body was found earlier. 
A love triangle, a possible sex racket, and Thapa's greed for money were the reasons behind the murders, police said.
