A swarm of bees attacked about 30 people at a funeral in the Kendrapara district of Odisha, putting a halt to the last rites for over three hours. 
The bees interrupted the funeral of a 66-year-old man after a nearby tree, which was home to the bees, was mistakenly set on fire. 
Firefighting personnel were called to douse the fire.
