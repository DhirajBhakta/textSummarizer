The SSJ International Hotel in Lucknow has introduced a new vegetarian menu inspired by Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, which includes saffron and orange-coloured dishes like paneer tikka and pineapple tarts. 
Its owner, Surendra Kumar Jaiswal said the "new menu reflects the combination of different flavours, yet these bear the hallmark of simplicity just like the Chief Minister."
