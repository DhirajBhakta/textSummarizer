A four-year-old girl died on Monday, two days after sustaining burns on her face when she fell into a pan containing hot tea in Delhi's Old Seelampur. 
Reportedly, her elder sister had prepared tea and kept it under the bed waiting for other family members to arrive when the girl fell off the bed and landed head-first into the pan.
