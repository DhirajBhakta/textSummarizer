The Supreme Court on Wednesday ordered the clubbing of two trials in the Babri Masjid demolition case. 
Notably, the case involving unnamed 'karsevaks' is being heard in a Lucknow court, while the second case related to the BJP leaders was being heard in a Raebareli court until now. 
Both the matters will now be heard in the Lucknow court.
