NDA Vice Presidential nominee Venkaiah Naidu on Sunday said that Pakistan should "recall what happened in 1971," and focus on their own country and maintain peace there. 
"Pakistan is mixing terrorism with religion. 
It has unfortunately become Pakistan's state policy," he added. 
India had won the 13-day war against Pakistan in 1971, which resulted in the liberation of Bangladesh.
