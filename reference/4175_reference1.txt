Hotel Hayat Rabbani in Jaipur has been sealed after nearly 100 cow vigilantes protested outside the hotel on Sunday night alleging that beef was served inside. 
It was also alleged that the hotel staff threw the remnants of the non-vegetarian food in the nearby park. 
The Jaipur Municipal Corporation claims to have sealed the hotel for not discarding garbage properly.
