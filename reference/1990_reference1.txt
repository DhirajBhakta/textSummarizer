A 15-year-old girl died in Nepal after being banished to a shed during her menstrual cycle, under a custom 'Chhaupadi'. 
According to it, menstruating women have to stay in a shed outside the village as they're considered unclean. 
According to an official, over ten females have died due to this practice since 2006, despite it being outlawed by the government.nn
