Calcutta High Court judge Justice CS Karnan has ordered a five-year jail sentence for Supreme Court judges, including the Chief Justice of India Jagdish Singh Khehar. 
Karnan, who had earlier accused the seven-judge bench of discriminating against him for being a Dalit, said the judges are guilty under the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act.
