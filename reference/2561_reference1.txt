Delhi High Court on Tuesday said the merit position of students could change substantially in the ongoing Delhi University admissions after re-evaluation of the answer sheets submitted to the CBSE. 
However, Delhi University officials said this should not worry students who have already secured the college seats even if their marks get reduced after re-evaluation.
