All polling booths for the upcoming Municipal Corporation of Delhi elections have been declared tobacco-free by the Delhi State Election Commission, in a first in the country. Additionally, banners having content related to the ill effects of tobacco will be displayed at entry gates of all booths. However, a no-smoke policy was implemented at poll booths in 2014 general elections.
