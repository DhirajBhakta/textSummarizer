The Congress-led Opposition's President nominee Meira Kumar on Tuesday said that the presidential poll contest with BJP-led NDA's candidate Ram Nath Kovind is not a political war but a fight of ideologies. 
"Sad caste is a factor in election... 
Pained by discussion over my caste. 
Why doesn't the society rise above these divisions," the former Lok Sabha Speaker added.
