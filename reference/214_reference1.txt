At least 10 people, including an election candidate, were killed on Sunday in violent protests which erupted as the country voted for a new legislative body tasked with rewriting the Constitution. 
The country's opposition parties boycotted the vote, which they say is aimed at consolidating President Nicolas Maduro's power and is a bid to install a dictatorship.
