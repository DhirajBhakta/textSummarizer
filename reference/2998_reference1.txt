A 52-year-old man from Delhi ate two metal plates, six needles, several blades and tubelights while performing yoga in 2008, believing this would keep him healthy. The objects remained in Shailendra Singh's stomach for nine years before he visited a Delhi hospital with acute pain in his stomach three months ago. Singh has undergone a surgery and is recuperating.
