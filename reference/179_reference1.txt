Several copies of Rado watches, sunglasses, and cameras worth 10 crore were seized on Thursday by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence at Delhi's Indira Gandhi International Airport. While original Rado watches cost over 1 lakh, the copies seized were meant to be sold in the market for 4,000-5,000. The consignment from China was to be received in Delhi.
