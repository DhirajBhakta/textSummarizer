Residents of Gurugram's Fresco Apartments spent 1.5 lakh of their money to fix potholes on the road leading to the residential complex after the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram allegedly refused to fix them. The apartments' resident welfare society reportedly conducted a survey where 70% of the residents opted for voluntarily contributing 1,000 to fix the road.
