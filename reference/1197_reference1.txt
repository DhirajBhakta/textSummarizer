RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat said on Saturday that no one has the right to judge the patriotism of others. 
"Even if you think that you are running the show in the country, you cannot measure anybody's patriotism or come out with a judgement," he added. 
Bhagwat further said that patriotism does not have an existence of its own.
