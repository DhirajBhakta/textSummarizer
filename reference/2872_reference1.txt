On the eve of Indian PM Narendra Modi's US visit, President Donald Trump's administration has said that the President realises India has been a "force for good" in the world and ties with it are important. 
"It would be wrong to say that this (US) administration has been ignoring India," officials added. 
Notably, this will be the first Trump-Modi meeting.
