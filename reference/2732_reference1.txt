China on Monday responded to India's statement saying it is also different from the China of 1962. "[T]o some extent he is right in saying India in 2017 is different from India in 1962, just like China is also different," said a spokesperson. China has also claimed that India is using "excuse of Bhutan's interests to infringe upon China's territory".
