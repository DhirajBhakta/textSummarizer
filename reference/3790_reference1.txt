A Bhopal-bound Jet Airways flight at Mumbai Airport was forced to return to bay after passengers started protesting over its non-functional air conditioning system. 
The 1.5-hour flight, carrying 130 passengers, had proceeded to the runway and was about to take-off when passengers reportedly stood up to protest. 
The flight took off after the technical team fixed the issue.
