The Iraqi prison where the External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj said the 39 missing Indians were last located, has reportedly been reduced to rubble with no signs of the citizens. A Congress leader then took a dig at Swaraj saying, "minister misled the nation that missing boys are lodged in a jail in Badush but...jail has been destroyed by ISIS."
