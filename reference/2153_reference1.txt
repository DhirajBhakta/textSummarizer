A man reportedly severed two legs of a two-month-old puppy after the dog gave him a minor scratch in south-west Delhi's Dwarka. 
The police have initiated action against the accused under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act. 
The dog scratched the accused's leg with a paw which made him angry, an official said.
