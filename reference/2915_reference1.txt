Posters were put up in Gujarat featuring pictures of 110 senior BJP leaders of the state, with the caption reading, "Identify the leaders or you will lose your job." This comes after two lower-level workers in the state were suspended for failing to recognise BJP politicians. The posters, put up near the Gujarat Assembly, were later removed by BJP workers.
