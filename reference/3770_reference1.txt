The drivers of cab aggregating startups Ola and Uber are scheduled to go on a one-day strike in Delhi on Tuesday. The kaali-peeli taxi operators have joined hands with rivals Ola and Uber for the strike. The drivers claim that nothing has changed since their February protest and they are barely earning enough to eat and pay their car EMIs.
