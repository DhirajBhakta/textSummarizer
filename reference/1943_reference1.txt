The IGI Airport in Delhi on Friday reintroduced security stamps for hand luggage, after a week-long trial run failed to save time due to congestion at terminals. 
CISF Director General OP Singh said, "In Delhi...in some cases, during random check at boarding gates, few suspicious items were caught." 
However, the trial run is expected to return after Republic Day.
