Union Minister M Venkaiah Naidu on Saturday said the present BJP-led Centre aims to shift all government scheme-related financial transactions to Jan Dhan, Aadhar and Mobile (JAM) platforms across India in the next 2-3 years. 
Adding that corruption in government schemes will be reduced, Naidu said that JAM would bring a big financial revolution in the country.
