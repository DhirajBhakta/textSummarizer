US President-elect Donald Trump, who won TIME Person of the Year, had slammed the magazine in 2013 saying, "The Time Magazine list of the 100 Most Influential People is a joke and stunt of a magazine that will...soon be dead." After winning the award this year, Trump, however, said it is a "great honour" which means a "lot to him".
