Delhi government is reportedly planning to allow colleges to issue leaners' driving licences to students by September. 
It was proposed because the demand for these licences was allegedly highest among the 18-24 age group applicants. 
Students have to be above 18 years of age for eligibility and score at least six out of ten marks in an online test.
