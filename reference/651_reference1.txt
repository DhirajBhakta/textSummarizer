China opened a cinema hall on Yongxing Island in the disputed South China Sea on Saturday, not far from where an American warship sailed earlier this month. 
Over 200 residents and soldiers attended an inaugural screening of the Chinese movie 'The Eternity of Jiao Yulu'. 
Several countries, including the Philippines and Malaysia, have territorial claims over the South China Sea.
