An unverified call, received by the Railway Protection Force (RPF) on Thursday, warning about a bomb in Mumbai's Churchgate station turned out to be a hoax. 
Notably, it is the sixth anniversary of the triple blasts at Zaveri Bazar, Opera House and Dadar which left 26 people dead. 
The police are working to trace the person who telephoned the RPF.
