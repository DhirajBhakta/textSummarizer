The completion of Delhi Metro's Phase IV, which was cleared recently by the government, is likely to make it the second-largest metro system and the largest outside China, reports said. 
Delhi Metro, which is currently the 11th largest, is estimated to carry about 70 lakh people regularly after completion. 
The Phase IV will add over 100-km to Delhi Metro network.
