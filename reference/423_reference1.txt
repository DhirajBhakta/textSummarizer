A forest department report submitted to the High Court suggested that all the seven domesticated elephants of Delhi be shifted to a sanctuary outside the city. It observed that not only were the elephants kept in poor conditions, but it was also risky to house them in crowded localities. Most of the elephants don't have proper ownership certificates, report said.
