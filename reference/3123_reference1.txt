Two men staged a mock wedding in Tirunelveli, Tamil Nadu, to protest the reopening of state-owned liquor shops in the state. 
People had earlier forced closure of liquor outlets, citing the ill-effects of alcohol. 
The shops reopened recently, with protestors staging the mock wedding saying, "If you are an alcoholic, we will not let our women marry you."
