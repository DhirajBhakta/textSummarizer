Nineteen international and domestic flights to and from Chennai were delayed on Friday as dense smoke engulfed the area around the airport after old articles were burnt on the occasion of Bhogi. 
Old and unwanted articles of the past year are burnt as a symbolic gesture during Bhogi, which is celebrated on the first day of Pongal.
