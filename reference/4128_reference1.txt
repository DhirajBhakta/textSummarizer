A 19-year-old woman was hospitalised in Delhi with a burnt throat and face, after she was allegedly forced to drink acid by her former boyfriend. 
The alleged attacker, Ravi Kumar (22), later surrendered at the city's Sangam Vihar police station. 
The woman was undergoing treatment at AIIMS with 20% burns but the doctors said she is expected to survive.
