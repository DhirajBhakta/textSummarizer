Calling Venezuela's recent Constituent Assembly election a "sham", US Ambassador Nikki Haley said that Venezuela is heading towards a dictatorship. 
Haley also threatened strong and swift action against the "architects of authoritarianism" in Venezuela. 
She added that the US stands by Venezuelans and their constitutional representatives to restore their country to a full and prosperous democracy.
