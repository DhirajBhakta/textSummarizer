Following criticism from Opposition for making Aadhaar number mandatory for students to avail mid-day meals, the government has said that the benefits will continue based on alternate means of identification. 
The schools will have to get the children enrolled under Aadhaar but until a number is assigned, the children will continue to get the benefits, it added.
