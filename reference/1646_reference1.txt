Experts have claimed that Pakistan faked the launch of the nuclear-capable Babur-3 cruise missile on Monday, reports said. 
An analyst claimed that Pakistan used a computer generated image of a missile over the background to show that Babur-3 was successful. 
The missile's speed is "impossibly high" and it changes colour from white to orange in the video, another analyst claimed.
