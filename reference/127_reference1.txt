A ticket examiner was allegedly stabbed on Sunday by one of the three passengers when he asked them to deboard a train for traveling without tickets in Delhi. 
The victim said that the accused had boarded a reserved coach and stabbed his arm with a sharp-edged weapon when he tried to be stern in asking them to deboard.
