China's first aircraft carrier battle group has conducted its first-ever exercise with live ammunition in the Bohai Sea, China's Navy said on Thursday. 
This was reportedly conducted to test equipment and troop training levels. 
This comes amid increasing tensions in the Asia-Pacific region over the South China Sea dispute and US President-elect Donald Trump's remarks against 'One China' policy.
