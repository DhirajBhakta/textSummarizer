The husband of former Doordarshan anchor Kanchan met CM Devendra Fadnavis, alleging that inaction by the BMC led to his wife's death after a tree fell on her. 
Fadnavis assured him that action has been initiated against the garden department of BMC. 
The BMC had reportedly earlier decided to prune the tree after an inspection, instead of cutting it down.
