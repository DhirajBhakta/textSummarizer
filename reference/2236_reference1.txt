The Election Commission (EC) barred voters from carrying their personal pens inside the voting chambers while casting their vote in the Presidential Election on Monday. 
All voters were given special serial-numbered pens with violet ink before entering the polling station, and their personal pens were collected. 
MPs had green-coloured ballot papers and MLAs pink-coloured ones.
