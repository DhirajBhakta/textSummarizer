The triple talaq case in the Supreme Court originated from the petition filed by Shayara Bano in 2016 in a case of divorce from her husband. Bano was given divorce through a 'talaqnama' sent to her while she was at her parents' place. A postgraduate in Sociology, Bano petitioned the court for a ban on triple talaq and polygamy.
