While addressing leaders of his party on Saturday, recently ousted Pakistani PM Nawaz Sharif asked if everyone else in the country is "Sadiq and Ameen" (honest and righteous). "I'm proud that I have not been declared ineligible over charges of corruption," Sharif said about his disqualification from the country's top post for not disclosing his earnings during the 2013 election.
