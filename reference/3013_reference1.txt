Princess Diana tried cutting her wrists with razors weeks after marrying Prince Charles, secret tapes recorded in 1991 have revealed. 
She said in the tapes, "I was so depressed... 
I was in a very bad way," and had bulimia. 
Diana described her love for Charles and insecurity of Camilla Parker Bowles, whom he married years after Diana died.
