Union Minister Jitendra Singh on Wednesday laid the foundation stone for the construction of a new hostel in Jawaharlal Nehru University and announced that  75% seats in the hostel will be reserved for students from the northeast. 
The five-floor hostel, which has been pending for three years, will accommodate 400 students and is expected to be completed within twenty months.
