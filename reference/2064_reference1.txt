Patna-based Mahavir Mandir Trust has asserted that construction of the Viraat Ramayan Mandir? 
which it claims will be the world's largest Hindu temple? 
will begin in 2017 after Holi. 
"We modified our original plan after Cambodia raised objection to our Viraat Ramayan Mandir, saying it is a replica of Angkor Wat," the Trust said.
