Shiv Sena MP Ravindra Gaikwad, whose assault of a 60-year-old Air India staffer resulted in the formation of the government's 'no-fly' rule, has called the ruling a "welcome move". However, he also called for "stricter guidelines for airline staff as well". Gaikwad was banned from travelling in various airlines after he attacked an Air India staffer with a slipper.
