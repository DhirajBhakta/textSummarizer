Neelam Sanjiva Reddy is the only President of India who was elected to the highest office without a contest ever since the country won independence. While 37 candidates had filed their nominations for the 1977 Presidential elections, the Returning Officer rejected 36 after scrutiny and the only valid nomination was that of Neelam Sanjiva Reddy.
