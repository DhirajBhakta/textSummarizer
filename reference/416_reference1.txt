Singer Lata Mangeshkar has revealed that in early 1950s, playback singers were called 'ghost voices' because they were totally invisible to the public. 
She added, n"Even my name wasn't printed...it was the name of the character the heroine played that was printed on the record." 
Lata further said that she never thought of her nvoice being bigger than the film.
