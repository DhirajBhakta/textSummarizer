Rejecting Congress' claims of its Gujarat MLAs being poached by BJP, Union Minister Prakash Javadekar said, "It is like a thief attacking a cop." Talking about Congress' move to send its Gujarat MLAs to Bengaluru to refrain them from shifting parties, Javadekar said their lawmakers were "enjoying themselves" there while BJP's were busy providing relief to the state's flood-hit people.
