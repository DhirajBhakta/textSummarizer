A six-month-old medical report from a mohalla clinic in Delhi showing an abnormally high blood sugar level of 9,481.7 mg/dl for a patient, has gone viral on social media. 
The AAP government has however dismissed the report as "forged", saying such messages are being spread to discredit the system. 
The normal level is usually less than 140 mg/dl, post meals.
