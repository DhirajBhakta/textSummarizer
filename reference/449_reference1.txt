The Bombay High Court on Monday directed the police to ensure that no minors are "harmed, injured, or permitted to carry or use weapons or sharp objects," during this year's Muharram procession. Shia Muslims participating in Muharram processions hit themselves with sharp objects to mourn the death of Imam Hussain, the grandson of Prophet Muhammad.
