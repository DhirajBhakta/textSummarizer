Defence Minister Arun Jaitley has said that China is trying to enter India's territory and added that India is not entering into any country's land. 
Further reacting to China asking India to withdraw troops from Bhutan border areas and recall the 1962 war, Jaitley said, "India of 2017 is different from India of 1962. 
Those were different situations."
