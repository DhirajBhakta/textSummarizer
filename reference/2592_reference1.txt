After transitioning to biometric attendance, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has announced that employees will not receive their salary if they fail to mark attendance through the system. Almost 70,000 of BMC's over 1 lakh employees have already been registered on the new system, reports said. This comes as part of a revamp that also includes changing official duty hours.
