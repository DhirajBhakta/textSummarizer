Prime Minister Narendra Modi has asked his ministers to give details of tours, if any, undertaken by them during the last three months, according to reports. The exercise is said to be aimed at ascertaining whether the ministers promoted demonetisation and other initiatives of the government. The Prime Minister reportedly gave the directive at a recent Cabinet meeting.
