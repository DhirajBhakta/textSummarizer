The South Delhi Municipal Corporation is planning to install electronic toll system for collecting tax to decongest toll plazas. 
The equipment will be installed at 13 locations by March-end on a pilot basis, officials said. 
The e-toll system involves tax payment through radio frequency device system which allows automatic deduction of toll tax from a customer's account.
