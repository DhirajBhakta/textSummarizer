To avoid a shortage of beef, the BJP-led government in Goa has not blocked the option of getting the meat from Karnataka's Belgaum, Goa CM Manohar Parrikar said on Tuesday. Adding that around 2,000 kg of beef was produced daily at Goa's only legal slaughterhouse, Parrikar said the slaughterhouse can increase production if traders bring in more animals.
