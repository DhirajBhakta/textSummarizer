Chinese Meteorological department on Saturday warned people against coming in contact with snow in Beijing, claiming that the snow is "dirty" as it has absorbed pollutants from the smog which engulfed Beijing recently. The officials also advised people to carry umbrellas for protection. Meteorological officials have said snow followed by blasts of wind will clean up Beijing's air.
