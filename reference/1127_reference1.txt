Diners at an Indian restaurant in England were forced to leave mid-way after health inspectors discovered a cockroach infestation. 
German cockroaches were found in the food store and freezers at Sand's of Glenfield. 
A notice on the restaurant door said, "We are... taking all the necessary steps to ensure that we provide the best possible environment for our valued guests."
