Andhra Pradesh CM Chandrababu Naidu on Friday inaugurated 'Pariskara Vedika', a call centre meant for public grievance redressal. People will be able to directly contact call centre executives to give feedback and get information on government welfare schemes, by giving their Aadhaar number. Notably, this is the biggest call centre run by a state government in India.
