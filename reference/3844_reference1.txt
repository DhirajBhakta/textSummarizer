Indian painter Jamini Roy, born in West Bengal, is known as one of India's leading modern artists of the 20th century. 
Roy, who reportedly made about 20,000 paintings, was awarded the Padma Bhushan in 1954. 
Google Doodle honoured Jamini Roy on Tuesday with a doodle inspired by his 'Black Horse' painting, on the occasion of his 130th birth anniversary.
