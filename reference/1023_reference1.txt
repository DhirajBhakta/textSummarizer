China has extended its hold by three months on the US proposal to list Jaish-e-Mohammad chief and Pathankot terror attack mastermind Masood Azhar as a designated terrorist by the UN. Azhar would have been automatically designated if China wouldn't have extended the hold. China earlier repeatedly blocked India's move to ban Azhar, leading to a lapse of India's application.
