Swedish brewery PangPang has created a beer meant to be consumed in the shower. 
The 'Shower Beer' has a soapy flavour and a relatively higher alcohol content as compared to other beers. 
The brewery says the beer is "sweet, but strong" and "meant to gulp in three sips while standing in the shower."
