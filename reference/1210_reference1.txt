Realty portal PropTiger has said that its monthly average housing sales fell 40% during November-December 2016 in top nine cities because of the government's demonetisation move. 
New home launches fell 49% in the period, the company added. 
News Corp-backed PropTiger, which recently merged with real estate search portal Housing, laid off 200 employees this week in a restructuring exercise.
