Apollo Hospitals on Tuesday said that there was "no interference" in the medical treatment given to former Tamil Nadu Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa and that they are ready to face any probe. 
This comes after several political parties have demanded a detailed probe into the treatment given to Jayalalithaa and the circumstances that led to her hospitalisation.
