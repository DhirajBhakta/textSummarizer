Mumbai University has asked its colleges to speed up the assessment process by assigning evaluators in proportion to their students. 
Reportedly, only 28% teachers are evaluating the answer scripts and only 6.5 lakh out of 18 lakh answer sheets have been assessed so far. 
The on-screen assessment system adopted by the university this year was blamed for the delay.
