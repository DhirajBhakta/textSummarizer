The Centre informed the Lok Sabha there is no proposal in consideration to scrap Sahayak or buddy system in the Army. 
This comes after several jawans voiced their outrage against the system saying they are treated like servants by senior officers. 
Notably, under Sahayak system, a jawan is attached to officers and their duties include protecting and helping the officers.
