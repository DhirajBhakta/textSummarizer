Bombay High Court on Friday stated that after the death of Manjula Shetye, a female convict at Mumbai's Byculla jail, the issue of security of inmates has become important and it needs to be looked into. 
The statement was in response to a petition by a convict in Yerwada Central Jail who complained of inhuman treatment of his fellow inmates.
