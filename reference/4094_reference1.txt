The Election Commission has transferred Chennai Police Commissioner Sebastian George out of the city ahead of the by-polls in former CM Jayalalithaa's constituency RK Nagar. This comes after the opposition DMK told the poll panel that George might act in a way that favoured the ruling party. The RK Nagar by-polls are scheduled for April 12.
