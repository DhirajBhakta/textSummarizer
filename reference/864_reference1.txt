The US has ended a four-month ban on flyers carrying laptops on US-bound flights from airports in North Africa and the Middle East. 
Last month, officials announced new security requirements for all airlines rather than an extension of the laptop ban. 
The UK continues to enforce a similar electronics ban on flights from several Middle Eastern airports.
