Pakistan on Thursday said it was considering India's request for the grant of visa to the mother of Kulbhushan Jadhav for a visit to meet her son, who was sentenced to death for "spying". 
This comes days after Union Minister Sushma Swaraj slammed her Pakistani counterpart Sartaj Aziz for "not showing the courtesy to acknowledge" her letter on the matter.
