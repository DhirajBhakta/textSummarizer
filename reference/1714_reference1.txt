Pakistan's Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on Thursday claimed that Kashmir was an "integral part" of Pakistan and praised the deceased Hizbul Mujahideen leader Burhan Wani calling him a "vibrant and charismatic leader". 
The remarks were made during Sharif's speech at the International Parliamentary Seminar on Kashmir held in Islamabad to discuss the situation in "India-held" Kashmir.
