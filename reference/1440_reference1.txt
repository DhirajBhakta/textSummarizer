Women were spotted wearing hijabs made out of the American flag at the Women's March in Washington, DC, held against the new US President Donald Trump. Some non-Muslim women also reportedly wore the flag hijab to the march in a show of support. Ever since his election campaign, Donald Trump said he plans to ban Muslims from entering the US.
