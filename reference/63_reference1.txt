The Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS) in Bihar's Patna has asked its employees to declare their virginity and number of wives/husbands in a marital declaration form. 
Further, the form spelt bachelor as 'bechelor'. 
"This is not a new form and has been in practice since 1984 when IGIMS was established," Deputy Medical Superintendent Dr Manish Mandal said.
