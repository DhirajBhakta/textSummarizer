UAE's envoy to India Ahmed Al Banna has denied media reports claiming that underworld don Dawood Ibrahim's assets worth 15,000 crore were seized in Dubai. "A legal process has to be followed in the country for an action against any individual," he said. Notably, BJP had also cited the reports claiming the seizure to be PM Narendra Modi's diplomatic masterstroke.
