Police in the US have rewarded an Indian-origin man who was robbed while saving his colleague's life. 
Thirty-four-year-old Anil Vannavalli was waiting for a train when his 26-year-old colleague Madhuri Recherla fainted and fell onto the tracks. 
Someone stole his backpack while he was rescuing Recherla, and the police called the robbery "disgusting" and gifted him $1,000 (over ?
64,000).
