Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) has created a video to spread awareness among parents about the dangers of online radicalisation. 
Warning parents that terror recruiters can target their children online, the video asks parents to be cautious when their children spend too much time on the internet and to keep a tab on their online activities.
