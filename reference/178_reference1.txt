The Maharashtra government is planning to introduce cycling tracks along the arterial roads of 10 cities including Pune, Nagpur, Nashik, and Latur, reports said. A four-member committee has been constituted for designing the cycling track routes. "The cycling tracks will not only reduce traffic, but will also considerably lessen environmental pollution," a Public Works Department official said.
