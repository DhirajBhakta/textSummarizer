A BJP MP has moved a private member's bill in the Lok Sabha, seeking reservation of five seats in the Lok Sabha and one in the Rajya Sabha for residents of Gilgit and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) regions. 
The MP expects the bill to be taken up during the second phase of the Budget Session of Parliament starting from March 9.
