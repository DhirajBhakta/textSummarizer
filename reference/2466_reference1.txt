The fishermen community in Mumbai has objected to Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation's plans of reclaiming 300 acres of the bay area at Cuffe Parade to build a recreational park. 
The Akhil Maharashtra Machhimar Kriti Samiti has stated that the move is likely to affect the livelihood of 20,000 fishermen since the area is used to park around 400 boats.
