Two senior immigration officers posted at the Mumbai International Airport were arrested for their involvement with a gang that helped people illegally fly out of the country. 
The immigration officers, Anil Surse and Harshal Patil, allegedly let people pass through the immigration without important checks. 
They helped at least 50 people without proper documentation leave the country, police said.
