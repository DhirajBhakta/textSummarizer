Maharashtra government on Friday announced plans to make installation of GPS system mandatory in black-and-yellow taxis and autorickshaws. 
The issue was raised by an Opposition leader, who said that passengers' safety had become cause for concern. 
"Autorickshaws and conventional taxis will have to install GPS system on the lines of app-based aggregators such as Ola and Uber," said an official.
