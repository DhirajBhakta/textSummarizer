Germany's Constitutional Court on Wednesday ruled that ultra-conservative Muslim girls must take part in mixed swimming classes at school after a student argued it breached Islamic dress codes. 
The court said there were "no binding rules in Islam" to define appropriate clothing. 
This comes while Germany has been trying to assimilate over 10 lakh migrants, mostly Muslims, into its society.
