A 37-year-old man on Friday allegedly strangled his wife to death over suspicion of an extra-marital affair after the two had an argument in Delhi's Kotla Mubarakpur. 
The man believed his wife had an affair when he had gone to Saudi Arabia recently, police officials said. 
He also kept a watch on her and even checked her phone, they added.
