After the Supreme Court upheld death penalty to four Nirbhaya gangrape convicts, one convict's sister said that anyone can make mistakes and should be given a second chance. 
Claiming that it is not always the boy's fault, she added that the girls too provoke guys. 
She further said that despite having a tainted image, she still loves her brother Pawan.
