The Border Security Force on Wednesday sacked constable Tej Bahadur Yadav, who had uploaded a video clip on social media alleging poor quality of food being served to jawans at border posts. 
This comes after a summary court-martial found that constable Yadav's actions damaged the "image of the BSF". 
Under BSF rules, he can appeal the suspension within 3 months.
