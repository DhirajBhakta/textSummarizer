Sabzar Bhat, who reportedly became terror outfit Hizbul Mujahideen's commander after Burhan Wani's death last year, has been killed by security forces in an encounter in Pulwama, Jammu and Kashmir. Bhat, who was among the 8 militants killed in two encounters in the Valley on Saturday, called his family members before dying and said, "Forgive me, if I'm wrong."
