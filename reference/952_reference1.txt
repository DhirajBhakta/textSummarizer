Children in at least 3 schools along the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir's Rajouri district were evacuated in bullet-proof vehicles on Tuesday after Pakistan fired on Indian posts along the border. 
Schools in 23 villages close to the LoC have been closed indefinitely and 3,500 people have been moved to relief camps, district police officials said.
