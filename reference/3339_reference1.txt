British political journalist Mehdi Hasan had used the phrase "farrago of distortions, misrepresentations..." while speaking in a debate at the Oxford Union in 2013. 
The phrase was used by Congress leader Shashi Tharoor to dismiss allegations of him being involved in his wife's death. 
The use of the phrase by Tharoor had led to several internet memes and jokes.
