Pakistan on Saturday accused India of targeting the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) project through subversive activities. Pakistan further said that it is aware of "enemy designs" and is taking effective counter measures. Notably, India which has repeatedly dismissed all such allegations has raised sovereignty concerns over the project as it passes through Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.
