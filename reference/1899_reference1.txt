Around 16 people were wounded in a grenade explosion on Saturday outside a Catholic church during Christmas eve mass at the southern island of Mindanao in the Philippines. No one has claimed responsibility for the attack yet. Recently, the US embassy in the Philippines had warned its citizens against travelling to volatile southern islands because of kidnapping and bombing threats.
