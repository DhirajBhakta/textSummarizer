Afghanistan has accused Pakistan's spy agency ISI and the Pakistan-based banned terrorist outfit Haqqani Network of planning the Kabul blast, which killed 90 people and injured over 350 on Wednesday. 
An Interior Ministry spokesperson said that the Pakistan spy agency's role in the blast has been established, adding that India suffers from Pakistan-sponsored terror too.
