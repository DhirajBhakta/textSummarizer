The Kerala government on Tuesday said the state's tourism sector registered a loss of about ?
1,000 crore post the demonetisation drive by the Centre. 
The number of foreign tourists visiting the state decreased by 10-15% while the number of domestic tourists dipped by 20-30%. 
The fall is in contrast to the increase in the numbers before demonetisation, the government added.
