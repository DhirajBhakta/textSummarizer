Somalia's Internet has returned after an over three-week outage which reportedly cost the country's economy $10 million a day in business. 
The loss of internet service was attributed to a ship which cut an undersea cable connecting the country to global data networks. 
Hormuud Telecom, Somalia's largest telecom company, announced the restoration of service in a message to subscribers.
