Cyber Hub and the Leela Ambience Hotel in Gurgaon have changed their entrances to ensure an increased motorable distance and circumvent the 500-metre liquor ban near highways, according to reports. 
Several pubs and bars want to change the entrances to their properties, even as the Excise Department said that the process to measure the motorable distance will begin on Wednesday.
