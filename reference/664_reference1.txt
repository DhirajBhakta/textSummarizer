A 57-year-old yoga teacher died on Saturday, three days after a tree fell on her head during her morning walk in Mumbai's Chembur. 
The woman, a former anchor with Doordarshan, was admitted to a hospital with head injuries but didn't survive. 
The authorities allegedly didn't take action even after the locals had asked them to cut down the tilted tree.
