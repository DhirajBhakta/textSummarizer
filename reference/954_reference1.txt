A standoff between a local community and miners has emerged in New Zealand after 8,500 kg of highest quality gold was found on a protected conservation land. 
Miners plan to begin extracting small amounts of gold from next year. 
However, locals argue that no amount of gold is worth compromising with the peace and harmony of their sacred land.
