Gay men in England will be allowed to donate blood three months after having sex instead of a year, under equalities reforms announced by the government. 
The reforms will come into force in early 2018. 
Notably, a lifetime ban had been imposed on gay and bisexual men donating blood across the UK during the 1980s AIDS crisis.
