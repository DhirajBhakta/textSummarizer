A secondary school in the UK is offering hijabs or headscarves worn by Muslims as part of the uniform for pupils, becoming the first school in the country to do so. 
However, Muslim parents and pupils have complained that the uniform hijabs are not modest enough and could pose a suffocation risk if pulled back by other pupils.
