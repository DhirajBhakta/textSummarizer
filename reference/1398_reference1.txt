Florida wildlife officials have hired Indian snake hunters to get rid of Burmese pythons, which are wiping out small mammal populations in the state. 
The snake hunters, from the Irula tribe of Tamil Nadu, were brought in with translators and detection dogs earlier this month. 
"Traditionally, the main occupation of the Irula tribe has been catching snakes," a statement said.
