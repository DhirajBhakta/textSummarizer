PM Narendra Modi took a wristwatch by British company Sekonda and a decorative porcelain from the external affairs ministry's repository this year. All gifts received by ministers and officials have to be deposited at the repository, called toshakhana. However, a recipient can take home gifts valued under 5,000.
