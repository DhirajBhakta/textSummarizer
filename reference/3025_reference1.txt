The photographer who posted a picture of Kerala school's 'vulgar' uniform, has been booked under the POCSO Act after the school filed a case. Zachariah Pookunnam had first posted the picture on his Facebook page, saying that he received it from a friend. The school had claimed that the picture was photoshopped and it was not the actual uniform issued.
