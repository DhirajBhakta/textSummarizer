A reporter was punched in the face during a live broadcast as he reported on celebrations by paratroopers in Moscow on Wednesday. 
A man staggered up to Nikita Razvozzhayev and began ranting about Russia invading Ukraine, following which Razvozzhayev asked him to be quiet. 
The man punched Razvozzhayev, screaming, "If you talk to me like that you'll... get it."
