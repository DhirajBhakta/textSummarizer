Four airlines including IndiGo, Air India, SpiceJet, and Vistara on Wednesday lifted their ban on Telugu Desam Party MP Diwakar Reddy. 
The parliamentarian was banned by seven airlines after he allegedly manhandled IndiGo staff last month when they did not let him board an aircraft. 
Reportedly, Reddy has also agreed to withdraw the case he had filed against the airlines.
