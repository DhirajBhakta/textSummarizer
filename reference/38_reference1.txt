Substantial presence of PM1, reportedly the most dangerous particulate matter, has been found in areas around Delhi's Lodhi Road, a study by System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research said. 
Its presence in the Central Delhi area may be attributed to the huge flow of vehicles since the particulate matter is a product of vehicular pollution, reports said.
