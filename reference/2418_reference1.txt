After Mumbai Police filed an FIR against comedy group All India Bakchod (AIB) for tweeting a meme on PM Narendra Modi, its co-founder Tanmay Bhat shared Modi's old tweet on humour. 
The tweet, "We surely need more humour in public life", was posted by Modi on Twitter on March 17 following the BJP's landslide victory in the Uttar Pradesh Elections.
