The NDA government is planning a Ganga Act to penalise those found guilty of polluting the Ganga river. 
"I want to ensure cleanliness (Nirmalta) and uninterrupted flow (avirlta) of Ganga from its origin till its submerge into the sea," Water Resources Minister Uma Bharti has said. 
Once it is finalised, the bill will be taken up for the Cabinet's nod.
