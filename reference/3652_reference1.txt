A triple talaq victim, who was divorced through WhatsApp by her husband residing in Dubai, has reportedly revealed that she was forced to be surrogate to her mother-in-law by maintaining relations with her second husband. "Even my husband didn't refuse. When I refused, they tortured me and locked me in a room for as many as six days," she said.
