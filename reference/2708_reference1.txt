Chinese ambassador to India Luo Zhaohui on Tuesday said that India-China military standoff in the Sikkim section is "grave". 
There is "no scope for a compromise" in the region, Zhaohui asserted. 
He added that withdrawal of Indian troops from the area is a "pre-condition for any meaningful dialogue between China and India" to achieve a peaceful resolution to the conflict.
