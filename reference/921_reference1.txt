The Maharashtra government on Tuesday said that it will make drip irrigation mandatory for sugarcane cultivation after 2019. 
For this purpose, the state will also provide a loan at an interest rate of 2% to the farmers. 
Drip irrigation is not only expected to raise the sugarcane production but also help in conserving water.
