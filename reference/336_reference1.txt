A 17-year-old boy in Delhi was forced to drink acid by a group of men following an argument that started when he refused to sell them paneer owing to a shortage of fresh stock, according to reports. 
The men reportedly held the victim inside the dairy shop run by his family and forcefully poured acid into his mouth.
