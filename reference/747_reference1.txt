A team of army men in civilian clothes allegedly beat up eight policemen who stopped them at a barricade while they were returning from Amarnath Yatra. 
Reportedly, injured policemen were hospitalised and an FIR was registered against the army men. 
Notably, no non-locals, including yatris, are allowed travel at night in light of the recent terror attacks.
