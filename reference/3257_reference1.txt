Ranchi Municipal Corporation has used movie Sholay's climax scene in its posters to promote sanitation and toilet construction. 
Amitabh Bachchan's character can be seen in Dharmendra's arms asking him how he got injured. 
In response, Bachchan is shown saying, "I don't have a toilet at home, so I fell down while trying to relieve myself in the night."
