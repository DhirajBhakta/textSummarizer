J&K Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti on Saturday blamed external forces for creating unrest in the state and said, "There is infiltration, militants are coming from outside...Unfortunately, even China has started interfering." 
Mufti's comments came after her meeting with Home Minister Rajnath Singh after the terror attack in which eight Amarnath pilgrims were killed.
