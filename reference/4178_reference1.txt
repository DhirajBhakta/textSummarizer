Talking about plans on visiting the US, British physicist Stephen Hawking said, "I would like to visit again and to talk to other scientists, but I fear that I may not be welcome." 
He added that the country had taken a "definite swing to a rightwing, more authoritarian approach". 
The 75-year-old Cambridge scientist also raised concerns over Trump's environment policy.
