After facing criticism, the government of Nepal has withdrawn its decision to declare a public holiday on Friday, the day when President Bidya Devi Bhandari returns after completing her five-day state visit to India. In monarchical Nepal, public holidays were customarily announced whenever the King embarked on an official visit to any nation or returned home after the visit.
