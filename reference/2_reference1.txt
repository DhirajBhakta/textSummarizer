The Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS) in Patna on Thursday made corrections in its Marital Declaration Form by changing 'Virgin' option to 'Unmarried'. 
Earlier, Bihar Health Minister defined virgin as being an unmarried woman and did not consider the term objectionable. 
The institute, however, faced strong backlash for asking new recruits to declare their virginity in the form.
