The Keibul Lamjao National Park, located in the Loktak Lake in Manipur, India, is known as the only floating national park in the world. The area is characterised by 'phumdis', a Manipuri word referring to floating mats of soil and vegetation. Among numerous animal species, the park is home to the brow-antlered deer, which is locally known as the 'Sangai'.
