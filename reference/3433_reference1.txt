Kawaljit Singh Bhatia, a former advocate at the Supreme Court, has alleged in a Facebook post that his mother was harassed by Jet Airways officials at the Delhi International Airport on May 3. 
Bhatia added that his mother had a blackout and suffered an injury in the process. 
The airline, however, has denied the allegations.
