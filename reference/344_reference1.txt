The Lok Sabha on Friday passed the Indian Institute of Management (IIM) Bill, 2017 that aims at giving B-schools more autonomy and will allow them to grant degrees. 
The IIM Bill pushes for the declaration of 20 existing IIMs as institutions of national importance. 
"It is difficult to run IIMs from here (New Delhi)," HRD Minister Prakash Javadekar said.
