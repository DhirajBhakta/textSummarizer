Stanford researchers have found an abundance of marine life at Bikini Atoll island, which was declared a nuclear wasteland after the US tested 23 bombs between 1946-1958, including one 1,100 times larger than the Hiroshima atom bomb. The team discovered a diverse ecosystem thriving in the crater with corals and fish, and crabs devouring radioactive coconuts on the shore.
