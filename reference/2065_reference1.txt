Indian security forces on Wednesday killed top Lashkar-e-Taiba commander Abu Bakr in a 6-hour-long encounter in J&K's Sopore, reports said. 
Bakr was reportedly holed up in a residential building in a village near Sopore and was firing at army personnel from there. 
The forces blasted the building where Bakr was hiding, and recovered arms and ammunitions from the encounter site.
