Former Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf has said that India's Kulbhushan Jadhav is a bigger terrorist than Ajmal Kasab, who was executed by India for 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks. 
Claiming that Kasab was just a 'pawn', Musharraf added, "I don't even know how many people's deaths Jadhav is responsible for." 
He further said that India did wrong to approach the ICJ.
