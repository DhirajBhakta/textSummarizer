The Gurugram police has reportedly decided to deploy drones, sniffer dogs, and additional forces to ensure top security for the Kanwar yatris. 
Reportedly, separate lanes are also being created for the pilgrims to enable smooth traffic movement and maintain law and order. 
"Special security will be provided to women pilgrims during the yatra," a senior official said.
