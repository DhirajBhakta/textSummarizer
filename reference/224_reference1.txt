In a letter to PM Narendra Modi, over 100 military veterans condemned rising mob violence incidents against Dalits and Muslims and expressed concern over alleged climate of fear and suppression of dissent. 
Veterans said they stand with the 'Not in My Name' campaign and for "Unity in Diversity". 
They added if they'll not speak, they would be disservicing the country.
