US Permanent Representative to the UN Nikki Haley has said President Donald Trump may get involved in a peace process between India and Pakistan. 
"I would expect that the administration going to be in talks and try and find its place to be part of that (process)... 
And also wouldn't be surprised if the President participates as well," Haley stated.
