The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) has intercepted and arrested two foreigners, a woman and a man, from Delhi's Indira Gandhi International airport for carrying capsules of drugs in their stomach. 
While as many as 65 pellets of cocaine have been recovered from the Brazilian woman's stomach so far, doctors have taken out 90 pellets from the Afghani man's stomach.
