Russia said that the US missile strike on its ally Syria amounted to "aggression against a sovereign nation" and is likely to "damage US-Russia relations, which are already in a poor state." 
The US had fired 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles on a Syrian government airbase said to have been used to launch a chemical attack that killed over 100 civilians.
