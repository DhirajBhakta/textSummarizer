'Judge Uncle' is the presiding deity at the Devi temple in Kerala, and locals believe the judge saves 'innocents' trapped in legal hassles. 
Eighteenth-century judge Govinda Pillai, known for impartial judgements, had wrongly sentenced his nephew to death. 
Pillai ordered his own death for the error, and his soul is believed to be confined in a 'stone' at the shrine.
