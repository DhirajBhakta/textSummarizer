The Allahabad High Court on Tuesday said it would hear fresh appeals filed by Rajesh and Nupur Talwar challenging their conviction in the murder of their daughter Aarushi and domestic help, Hemraj. 
The court said it would hear the matter again due to "contradictions" in some submissions made by the CBI and fixed a hearing for August 31.
