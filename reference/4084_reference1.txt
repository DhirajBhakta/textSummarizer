A female teacher from Sharda Vidya Mandir in Porbandar, Gujarat, allegedly showed obscene videos to students and danced half-naked in front of them after taking them inside a room. 
While she threatened the kids against informing their parents, a student complained about it and the police arrested her after confiscating her mobile phone and finding several pornographic clips in it.
