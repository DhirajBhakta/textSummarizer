The reply to an RTI query by a Gurugram resident has revealed that private hospitals in the city are misusing their basement area by converting it into labs and offices. 
The resident alleged that since the basement, which is approved in building plans as parking space is being used commercially, the roads leading to the hospitals are packed with vehicles.
