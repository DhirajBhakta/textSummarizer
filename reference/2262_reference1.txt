The Republican Party of India has announced an agitation demanding a loan waiver of ?
636 crore for people of Scheduled Castes and Tribes starting July 25. 
The loans had been granted by state-run corporations for self-employment and other purposes. 
Like farmers, even people from socially backward classes are not in a position to pay, party leader Ramdas Athawale said.
