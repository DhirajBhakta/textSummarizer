The Japanese government has found that 70% of the Sekisei lagoon, Japan's biggest coral reef, has died due to bleaching caused by rising sea temperatures. 
It also found that over 91% of the coral is at least partly bleached. 
A survey in September and October discovered that over 56% of the reef had died, meaning the bleaching has spread rapidly.
