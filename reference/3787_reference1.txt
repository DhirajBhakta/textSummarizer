Juvenile Justice Board on Saturday ordered the Delhi government to issue a notification to ban the sale of whiteners, thinners and vulcanised solutions to children below the age of 18 years to check drug abuse. 
The board further asked the government to assign one de-addiction centre per district, observing that the existing centres in the national capital region are overcrowded.
