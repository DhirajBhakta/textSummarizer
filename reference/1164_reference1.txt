Over 14,000 cases of bonded labour have been received since 1993 to January 31, 2017, out of which 13,266 were disposed of, NHRC has reported. 
It would be wrong to think bonded labour is a thing of past, as it can be found even today in not only agriculture but also in other sectors, said NHRC Chairperson HL Dattu.
