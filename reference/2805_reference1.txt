The Punjab and Haryana High Court on Wednesday issued a stay on the amendment passed by the Punjab Assembly allowing hotels and restaurants along the state highways to serve liquor. 
This comes after an NGO filed a petition against the amendment. 
Earlier, the SC had banned the sale of liquor within 500 metres of state and national highways.
