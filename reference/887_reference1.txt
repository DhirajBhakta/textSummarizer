The Supreme Court on Wednesday observed that the right to privacy is not absolute and the state may put reasonable restrictions on it. 
Privacy is an "amorphous" term and defining it would be impossible, the court added. 
It further referred to the issue of data protection and said that its ambit was "much wider" than the right to privacy.
