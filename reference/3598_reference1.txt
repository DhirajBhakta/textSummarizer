The Election Commission has sought an unprecedented deployment of 74,000 paramilitary personnel from the Centre during the by-polls for the Anantnag Lok Sabha constituency on May 25. 
The Anantnag by-poll was earlier scheduled to be held on April 12 but was postponed amid widespread violence during the April 9 Srinagar by-polls, which left at least eight dead.
