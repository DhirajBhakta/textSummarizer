Scientists have successfully removed HIV DNA from the genomes of 'humanised' mice, using CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing tool, a step which in the future may help eliminate the virus in humans. 
The researchers were able to genetically inactivate the human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) in mice, that had been injected with human genes and cells.
