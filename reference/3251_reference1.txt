Campaigning ahead of UK's general election on 8 June has been suspended in the wake of Monday's terrorist attack at Ariana Grande's concert in Manchester. 
Prime Minister Theresa May will today chair a meeting of the government's emergency Cobra committee to discuss the attack. 
Trains to and from Manchester's Victoria station have also been cancelled until further notice.
