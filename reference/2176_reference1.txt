Sheetal Mhatre, a Shiv Sena corporator in Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), has proposed that organisations grant leave to female employees on the first day of their menstrual cycle. The proposal is likely to be discussed in BMC's general body meeting next month. "While we are equal to men, we must respect the fact that we are physically different," Mhatre said.
