In the wake of a viral video showing passengers fanning themselves due to a malfunctioned AC on an Air India flight, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation said prima facie it appeared the pilot violated the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP). 
The aviation watchdog said it would probe the incident, after passengers claimed the AC was not working even before take-off.
