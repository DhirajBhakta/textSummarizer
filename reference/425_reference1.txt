A Delhi court on Wednesday awarded a school principal and its director a 2-month jail sentence for causing mental trauma to a 7-year-old girl by not allowing her to attend classes. The teachers were allegedly instructed to not let the girl enter the classroom owing to a tiff between her parents and the school management over increased school fees.
