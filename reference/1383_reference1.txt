National Green Tribunal has given its permission to conduct the seventh edition of 21 Gun Salute International Vintage Car Rally between February 17-19 in Delhi. 
The tribunal made an exception to its 2014 order banning all vehicles older than 15 years in the national capital following a plea by show organisers that said the event raises funds for spastic children.
