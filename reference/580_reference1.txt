North Delhi Municipal Corporation has reportedly decided to develop e-rickshaw charging points at select parking lots. 
Drivers would be able to charge their e-rickshaws at "minimal" prices at night, reports said. 
Authorities reportedly plan to develop the charging points away from main roads to avoid jam, and expect to develop the facility at six locations by the end of August.
