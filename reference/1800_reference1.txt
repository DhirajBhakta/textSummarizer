India has criticised Pakistan for labelling the RSS, VHP and Bajrang Dal as terror outfits. 
Pakistan's linking of political parties and social outfits to terror was "absurd even by Pakistan's standards", said the MEA. 
"Labelling bonafide Indian social and cultural organisations as terror outfits seems a desperate attempt to deflect international focus from Pakistan's own complicity," it added.
