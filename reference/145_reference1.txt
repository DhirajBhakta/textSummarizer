The Supreme Court on Tuesday agreed to hear a plea seeking cancellation of Bihar CM Nitish Kumar's state Legislative Council membership for allegedly hiding a pending criminal case against him. According to the plea, Kumar was accused of killing a Congress leader in 1991. The petitioner also sought a direction to the CBI to register an FIR against Kumar.
