Noise pollution caused by humans is pervasive, posing a threat to land masses harbouring wildlife, a US-based study has found. 
Researchers found that human-made noise doubled background sound levels in 63% of areas studied while the distances that natural sounds could be heard were reduced by 50-90%. 
The noise affected wild animals as well as plants indirectly, researchers said.
