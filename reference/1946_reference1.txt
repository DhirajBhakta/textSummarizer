The proposed four-laning of highway connecting Goa and Mumbai will have around 1,300 roadside amenities, Union minister Nitin Gadkari said on Thursday. 
"Hotels, restaurants and outlets selling local produce can be promoted as part of these amenities. 
The local food can be made available along the road," he said. 
The facilities can be decided considering the tourism potential, he added.
