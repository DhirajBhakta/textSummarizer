After being denied visa twice, an all-female robotics team from Afghanistan has been granted a special one-time temporary US visa over humanitarian reasons after President Donald Trump intervened. 
This allows the team to participate in an international robotics competition. 
The US embassy in Kabul did not disclose why it rejected the team's visas earlier.
