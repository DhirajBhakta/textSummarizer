Jamlu, the presiding deity of Malana village, has "ordered" the closure of guest houses and restaurants to protect its culture, a panchayat official said. 
Malana follows Jamlu's orders and recently its parliament met to invoke the deity. 
"Those violating his orders will have to bear the brunt of his curse," the official said. n
