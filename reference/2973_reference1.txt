Thirty-two-year-old Jammu and Kashmir police officer Feroz Ahmed Dar, who was buried on Friday, had written a Facebook post, "Just imagine... yourself in your grave. 
Down there in that dark hole... 
Alone." 
Dar along with five other policemen was killed on Friday in an ambush in Achabal in Anantnag district by suspected Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) militants.
