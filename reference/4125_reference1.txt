Scientists have developed a test that can predict the age at which a person could develop Alzheimer's. The test calculates the risk of onset of disease based on genetic markers developed from data of over 70,000 individuals having Alzheimer's and otherwise. Researchers said that while genetics can influence the risk of dementia, a healthy lifestyle can also curb the risk.
