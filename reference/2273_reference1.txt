An Anti-Terrorism Court in Pakistan has ordered the seizure of properties belonging to Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf Chairman and Opposition leader Imran Khan for failing to appear in hearings of terrorism cases registered against him. Earlier, the court had issued perpetual warrants of arrest against Khan over violence in a case related to an attack on a senior police officer in 2014.
