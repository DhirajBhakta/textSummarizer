Norway's Global Seed Vault, meant to preserve world's crops from "doomsday" scenarios like nuclear war or asteroid strike has been flooded. 
The vault, built in permafrost (permanently frozen soil), was breached after soaring temperatures in the Arctic post Earth's hottest recorded year sent water gushing into its entrance. 
However, no damage was done to the seeds, said a government official.
