Rajya Sabha Deputy Chairman PJ Kurien on Thursday said airlines have no authority to impose a flying ban on anybody, including parliamentarians. 
The remark came in response to the issue raised by MP Naresh Agrawal about the recent bans on parliamentarians. 
If any MP does something against the law, the law of the land should take its course, Kurien added.
