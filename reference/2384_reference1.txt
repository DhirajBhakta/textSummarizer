Angry over delay in providing 25-million-strong NRI population voting rights, the Supreme Court on Friday directed the Centre to submit a plan within one week that ensures NRIs can cast e-votes from abroad. The bench remarked that the government has been deferring the amendment since 2014, adding, "The US lets you vote from space...Here, NRIs are pleading for it."
