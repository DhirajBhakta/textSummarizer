A group of international volunteers fighting with Kurdish forces against the Islamic State in northern Syria have formed the first LGBT military unit to battle the terror group. 
The formation of The Queer Insurrection and Liberation Army (TQILA) was announced on Monday. 
Notably, members of the LGBT community suffered stonings and executions at the hands of the militant group.
