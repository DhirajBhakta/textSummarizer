The Benina International Airport reopened on Saturday, three years after it was forced to close during the ongoing Libyan Civil War. Located near Benghazi, its first outward-bound flights were to the capital Tripoli and Amman, Jordan. Notably, the fights had escalated in Benghazi in 2014 when forces loyal to Khalifa Haftar launched a military campaign against Islamists and other opponents.
