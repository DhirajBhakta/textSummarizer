In a bid to avoid additional pressure on the troops, outgoing CRPF Director General K Durga Prasad has refused the ceremonial farewell parade planned for his retirement. 
"As such the CRPF is stretched. 
Then is the additional responsibility of ongoing elections," the 1981 batch IPS officer said. 
He instead visited the troops and tried to address their concerns, Prasad added.
