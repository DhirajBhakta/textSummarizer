Minister of State for Home Affairs Kiren Rijiju has informed the Parliament that there is no proposal with the Central government to build a wall along Pakistan border. 
In another statement, the Union Home Ministry said that approximately 250 km of India-Pakistan border has not been fenced primarily due to riverines, ditches and marshy terrain, and pending land acquisition.
