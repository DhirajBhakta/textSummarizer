As many as 40,000 Maharashtra doctors associated with the Indian Medical Association called off their strike over inadequate security in hospitals, after meeting CM Devendra Fadnavis on Friday. Fadnavis said more security has been provided since Thursday, and further arrangements will be made in the next 10 days. Earlier, doctors were warned to join work or take a pay cut.
