A trams transport system was introduced in Delhi in 1908. 
By 1921, Delhi reportedly had about 15 kilometres of tram track with 24 functioning trams. 
The system was however stopped due to congestion in the 1960s. 
The government in 2015 planned to reintroduce trams as public transport in Chandni Chowk area but abandoned the idea, citing high infrastructure cost.
