US-based researchers have developed a hands-free musical instrument that allows people to create music with their thoughts. The team developed the over 50-year-old technology of 'encephalophone', an instrument that collects specific brain signals through a cap and converts them into musical notes. Researchers hope this new instrument will empower and rehabilitate patients with motor disabilities.
