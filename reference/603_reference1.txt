A major fire broke out on Monday in Delhi's Lok Nayak Bhawan complex, which houses several government offices including those of the CBI and Income-Tax Department. Around 25 fire engines were rushed into service at the complex. The fire was allegedly sparked by a short circuit in an air-conditioning unit on the fourth floor of the building.
