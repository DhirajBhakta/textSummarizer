A wheelchair-bound man Mohammad Imran Qureshi plans to organise a 45-day skill development camp for the physically disabled this month. 
The workshop will provide training on how to use a wheelchair to its maximum capacity at public places and on difficult terrains. 
Imran said he's doing this for a social cause so that government organises such workshops across the state.
