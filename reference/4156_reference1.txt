The Supreme Court on Tuesday pulled up the Centre and the RBI over demonetisation measures taken, asking why they did not give a window to citizens to deposit old currency notes after December 31. 
The apex court gave the Central government and the Reserve Bank of India two weeks' time to reply to the notice.
