Over 800 surgeries across Delhi government and civic body-run hospitals had to be postponed after more than 20,000 resident doctors in the national capital went on mass casual leave on Thursday. 
The doctors went on leave in solidarity with a similar move by their Maharashtra counterparts over rising cases of assault on doctors by patients' relatives.
