The Delhi government is reportedly planning a new system under which Registration Certificates (RC) of cars will be directly delivered at home via speed post. Until now, car owners had to visit the Motor Licensing Office or the car dealer's showroom to get it. This is aimed at eliminating corruption and making the process easier for vehicle owners, officials said.
