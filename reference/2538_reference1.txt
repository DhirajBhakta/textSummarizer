A 12-year-old Class 6 student allegedly committed suicide by hanging himself in his hostel room at Jeedimetla on the outskirts of Hyderabad on Wednesday. 
He reportedly cut his bed sheet vertically, made it into a rope, tied it to the ceiling fan and hanged himself. 
The family members suspect that the boy might have been subjected to physical harassment.
