Pro-Gorkhaland protestors on Thursday attacked West Bengal Tourism Minister Gautam Deb's car as the agitation for a separate state entered its 29th day. 
Further, several government properties were vandalised in Darjeeling and the Minister claimed that the Centre was encouraging such incidents. 
However, the protestors denied involvement in cases of vandalism and demanded a CBI probe.
