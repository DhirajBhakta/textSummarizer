The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation on Tuesday demolished over 100 illegal shop extensions and 40 stalls near Santacruz station. 
The action was part of a drive by the corporation to free the public spaces from encroachments. 
The officials said that some of the stalls, which were at least four years old, did not have licenses to erect the sheds.
