The eight-lane Hero Honda Chowk flyover of Gurugram was opened to traffic on Monday. 
The flyover is expected to smoothen the traffic movement for commuters, including those travelling between Jaipur and Delhi via Gurugram and Manesar. 
The construction of the 1.4 km flyover started in 2014 as part of a three-layered crossing involving the flyover, underpass, and surface road.
