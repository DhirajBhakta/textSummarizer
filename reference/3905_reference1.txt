The Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation has issued guidelines to all states, allowing transgenders to use public toilets of the gender of their choice. 
The circular, also sent to the Swachh Bharat Gramin Mission, calls for the community's participation in Swachhta drives, and to recruit transgender people to help promote sanitation around the country.
