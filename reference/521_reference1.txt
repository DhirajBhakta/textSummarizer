Workers of Vivo phone factory on Tuesday protested and damaged the company premises in Greater Noida, alleging that the Chinese firm had sacked over 60 employees without giving prior notice. 
They claimed that Vivo, the title sponsor of IPL T20, hired many workers during the IPL season but fired over 1,000 employees after the matches ended nearly two months ago.
