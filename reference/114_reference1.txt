The Delhi Police on Saturday arrested a 45-year-old woman for supplying illegal weapons and recovered fourteen semi-automatic sophisticated pistols with magazines from her possession. A mother of five children, the accused had started supplying illegal arms after she was unable to meet her basic needs as a farm labourer. She was arrested based on a tip-off before an arms delivery.
