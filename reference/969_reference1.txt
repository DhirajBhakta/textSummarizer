Two Peruvian brothers were reportedly set on fire by fishermen in Chile in an attack that was reportedly triggered by competition between seaweed collectors. 
The attack comes amid an increase in racial discrimination in Chile against immigrants who arrive mainly from other Latin American and Caribbean countries. 
The victims suffered second and third-degree burns over half their bodies.
