Passengers are making their toddlers drag suitcases onboard to avoid paying the fee for checked-in baggage, Ryanair Chief Financial Officer Neil Sorahan said. 
Irish airline Ryanair charges extra for checked-in baggage, and travellers reportedly avoid this fee by carrying extra cabin luggage. 
Sorahan said, "I've seen two-year-olds wheeling a bag up to the plane as people try to take advantage."
