The BSF on Wednesday sacked constable Tej Bahadur Yadav, who had complained of "substandard food", for damaging the "image of the BSF". 
He was found guilty of not obeying orders by carrying two phones on duty and posting photographs in uniform on social media. 
Yadav was charged with making false allegations and not adhering to the formal grievance redressal system.
