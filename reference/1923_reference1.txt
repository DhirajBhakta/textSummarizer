Four Chinese nationals were arrested on Friday at Delhi Airport for trying to spend time with a friend flying to Hong Kong by allegedly using fake e-tickets to enter the terminal area. 
The police said out of the four, two had valid air tickets to travel, which they cancelled at last moment, while the remaining had allegedly faked their tickets.
