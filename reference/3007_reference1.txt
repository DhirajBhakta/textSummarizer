A Rajasthan policeman asked a woman, whose husband was arrested with 1 kg opium last week, to sleep with him to get her husband out of the jail. The cop initially demanded 2 lakh and when she expressed her inability to meet it, he asked her to 'compromise'. He was later arrested by the Anti-Corruption Bureau for taking some money.
