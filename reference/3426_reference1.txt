Sub-Divisional Magistrate Usha Chaturvedi, who listened to 2012 Delhi gang rape victim Nirbhaya's last declaration, has reportedly revealed that she wanted her rapists to be set on fire and not just be hanged. 
The Supreme Court on May 5 upheld the Delhi High Court's decision to award death penalty to four convicts in the Nirbhaya gang rape case.
