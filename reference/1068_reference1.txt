Delhi police has received complaints against US online retailer Lost Coast selling beer with images of Lord Ganesha, a week after officials asked a Czech Republic brewery to remove similar images from its products. 
The police has also received complaints against US-based apparel maker Yes We Vibe for selling shoes with the Om symbol on them.
