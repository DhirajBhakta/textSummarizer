The Vatican has turned off 100 fountains for the first time in years due to a prolonged drought affecting the city state and surrounding Italian city Rome. 
The Vatican said this was its "way of living in solidarity with Rome." 
Rome, which has also closed drinking fountains, is considering water rationing for as many as eight hours a day.
