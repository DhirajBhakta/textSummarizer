Four naked Ayyappa devotees were stopped from worshipping the deity in Karnataka's Kalghatgi by the villagers, reports said. 
The devotees were reportedly worshipping Lord Ayyappa being nude for the past 15 days and were planning to remain nude for 41 days. 
Their group leader Ramesh Guruswamy said by worshipping without considering cold and heat, wishes are fulfilled at the earliest.
