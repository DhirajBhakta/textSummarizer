A tree dubbed the 'neem-beer-tree', located in Delhi University's North Campus, has reportedly been secreting an intoxicating white liquid since November 2016. 
It reportedly releases 10 litres of the liquid every day, which smells like toddy, the alcoholic sap obtained from palm trees. 
"I had two to three glasses of the toddy. 
It was quite intoxicating," stated a labourer.
