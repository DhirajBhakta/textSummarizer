Shiv Sena members in the Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport committee opposed the proposal of buying 100 new mini buses from Force Motors. 
They suggested the committee to buy these buses from Tata Motors Limited. 
The members reportedly also claimed that the mini buses won't serve any purpose because their capacity was low compared to regular buses.
