The Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations has decided to make digital copies of the marksheets available to ICSE and ISC candidates along with the traditional hard copies from this year. The students can now access the marksheets digitally anywhere from their DigiLocker, which is a service providing dedicated personal electronic space in a government-owned public cloud storage.
