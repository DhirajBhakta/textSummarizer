Shyamwar Rai, the driver who turned approver in the Sheena Bora murder case, told the court on Friday that Indrani Mukerjea once said to him that she wanted to kill Sheena and Mikhail. 
"Indrani madam asked me to drive towards Taj Lands End (Mumbai). 
She sat on Sheena's face and strangulated her to death," he added.
