The most resilient form of life on Earth, tardigrade, also known as water bear, will survive until the Sun dies, as per an Oxford University research. 
The eight-legged micro-animal can survive for 30 years without food or water, and endure temperature extremes from -270?C to 150?C. 
Further, tardigrades can withstand catastrophic events like large asteroid impacts, supernovae, and gamma-ray bursts.
