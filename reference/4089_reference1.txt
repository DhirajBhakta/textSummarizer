IPS officer Himanshu Kumar was suspended on Saturday after he tweeted that seniors in the police department under the Adityanath government are targeting subordinates with Yadav surname. 
However, he later claimed that his comments were misinterpreted. 
After the UP police suspended Himanshu for indiscipline, he tweeted, "Truth alone triumphs."
