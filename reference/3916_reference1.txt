Veteran BJP leaders LK Advani and Murli Manohar Joshi on Thursday agreed to face conspiracy charges in the Babri mosque demolition case if the CBI can produce evidence against them in Raebareli. 
Earlier, CBI pleaded the Supreme Court to revive the charges against the leaders. 
Several BJP leaders remain accused of instigating crowds that demolished the Babri mosque in 1992.
