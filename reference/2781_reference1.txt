Pakistan has put a ban on Tehreek-e-Azadi-Jammu & Kashmir (TAJK), the new terror outfit of the 26/11 Mumbai attack mastermind and Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD) chief Hafiz Saeed. 
Saeed's previous terror fronts Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and JuD were declared terrorist organisations by the US, after which he started running his activities under the TAJK banner. 
Pakistan had earlier put him on house arrest.
