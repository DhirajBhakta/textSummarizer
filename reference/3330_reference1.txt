Kashmiri girl Afshan Ashique (21), who was photographed while pelting stones at the security forces in the Valley a few days ago, has desired to play football for India. 
"We were on our way to the TRC ground for practice when a policeman hurled abuses at us and slapped a girl which enraged me," she said.
