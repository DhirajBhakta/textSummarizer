Eight JNU students have been suspended for "disrupting" an academic council meeting held on Monday, as per reports. 
This comes amid the academic council approving a UGC notification, making entrance test for PhD and MPhil as only a "qualifying" criterion. 
The students' suspension will continue till a committee, set up on Tuesday to investigate the matter, submits its findings.
