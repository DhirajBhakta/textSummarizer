A Mumbai man was arrested on Saturday for allegedly murdering his wife after getting into an argument with her for going to work against his wishes. 
Police officials said the man hacked her to death with a sickle. 
He hid in the jungles of Dhulia after the incident and was caught by the police before he could enter Madhya Pradesh.
