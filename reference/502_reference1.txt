Mumbai Traffic Police have temporarily banned heavy vehicles on the Bandra-Dahisar stretch of the Western Express Highway between 5 PM and 9 PM due to "unprecedented rush". 
State-run buses, school buses, and vehicles used for office drops will reportedly be exempt from the ban. 
Authorities said that the northbound vehicles will be diverted to the Eastern Express Highway via Sion.
