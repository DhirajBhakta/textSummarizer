Democratic Representative Brad Sherman filed the first formal article of impeachment against US President Donald Trump on Wednesday. 
He accused Trump of committing obstruction of justice by firing former FBI Director James Comey amid a probe into Russian interference in the polls. 
Congress can remove presidents if enough lawmakers vote saying they committed crimes including treason and bribery.
