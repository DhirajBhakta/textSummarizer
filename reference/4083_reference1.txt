The British Parliament has passed a resolution condemning Pakistan's move to declare Gilgit-Baltistan in PoK as its fifth province. 
"Gilgit-Baltistan is a legal and constitutional part of the state of Jammu and Kashmir, India, which is illegally occupied by Pakistan since 1947," the motion said. 
The motion also called the construction of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) as "illegal".
