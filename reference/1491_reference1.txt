The Punjab and Haryana High Court on Thursday observed that going by the statements of two witnesses and the clothes laced with semen found at the site, it's evident that gang-rape was committed at Murthal last year during Jat quota agitation. 
The court also ordered the Haryana government-constituted Special Investigation Team to investigate and identify the victims and perpetrators.
