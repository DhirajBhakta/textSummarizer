Amid the current stand-off, China has released a map claiming a tri-junction, which is in conflict with India's and Bhutan's territorial claims. 
The map claims the Indian Army crossed the border at Doka La pass, which India and Bhutan consider Bhutanese territory but is claimed by China. 
Further, China marks its territory far south of where India and Bhutan do.
