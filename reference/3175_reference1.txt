The Kerala High Court on Wednesday said there is no need to interfere with the Centre's ban on sale of cattle for slaughter as it doesn't violate the Constitution. The HC made the statement while hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) which sought to quash the notification on ban of sale of cattle for slaughter.
