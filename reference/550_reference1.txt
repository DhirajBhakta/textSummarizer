A US court has ruled that President Donald Trump's commission on election fraud can resume collecting voter information from all states. 
The commission had asked states to provide publicly available data including registered voters' names, birth dates, and social security numbers. 
However, an advocacy group filed a lawsuit against the commission citing privacy concerns.
