Outgoing United States President Barack Obama and his family will board Air Force One for the last time to fly to Palm Springs, California for a vacation after Donald Trump's inauguration on Friday. 
Notably, it is a tradition for the outgoing president to take one last flight on the presidential plane before handing it over to the new president.
