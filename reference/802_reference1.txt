Punjab Director General of Police (DGP) Suresh Arora has said that the state police will increase presence on social media to tackle the hate spread online. 
"Police will set up own Facebook and other social media handles to nullify all such rumours. 
Some forces sitting in foreign countries are trying to vitiate the communal atmosphere of the state," he added.
