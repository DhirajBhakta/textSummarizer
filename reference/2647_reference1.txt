A 'Krishna Land' theme park on the lines of Disneyland and a walkalator between Agra Fort and Taj Mahal were among the projects proposed during a recent Lucknow meeting. 
UP CM Yogi Adityanath has reportedly shown interest in Krishna Land, asking for a proposal soon. 
Other proposals included a 'hop on - hop off' bus service in Agra.
