The Pakistani-origin terrorist behind the London Bridge terror attack, Khuram Butt, has reportedly been buried in secret without any rites or mourners after a number of UK cemeteries refused to accept the body. 
Butt masterminded the June attack in which he drove a van into pedestrians and stabbed people with a knife, killing eight and injuring 48 others.
