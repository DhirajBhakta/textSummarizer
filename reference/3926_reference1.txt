US-based researchers tested a cluster of trees, soil and woody debris to determine whether those three components were sources or sinks of greenhouse gases. Tree trunks were found to emit methane rather than storing it, scientists said, which could counteract absorption of methane by forest soils. However, the mechanism of methane production in forests was not clearly understood.
