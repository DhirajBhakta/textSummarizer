Delhi Police has issued an advisory to put the capital on high alert and advised 'special anti-terror' arrangements for the Kanwar Yatra pilgrims. 
Reportedly, quick reaction teams and commandos will guard the Kanwar Yatra routes and other vital establishments like malls, metro stations, and airports. 
This comes after seven Amarnath Yatra pilgrims were killed on Monday.
