Authorities have removed the copies of the Bible and Quran placed near APJ Abdul Kalam's memorial in Rameswaram in Tamil Nadu, following a complaint. 
Kalam's relatives had placed the books alongside the sculpted Bhagavad Gita placed near the statue before its inauguration. 
Later, a Hindu nationalist party filed a complaint saying keeping them without permission is wrong.
