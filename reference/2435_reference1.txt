The Supreme Court on Friday ordered the CBI to set up special teams to investigate into 62 alleged encounters by the Indian Army and other security forces in Manipur. 
Asking the agency to respond within two weeks, the SC has overruled objections by the government and the Army, which is accused in 28 of the 62 cases, with this order.
