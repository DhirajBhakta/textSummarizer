A Dutch game show was slammed by people for an episode which had an all-male panel 'guess' whether a woman was pregnant or fat. 
"For everyone thinking The Netherlands is great. 
We reached a new low yesterday night," tweeted a user. 
Reportedly, one of its episodes had a segment where contestants guessed if a man was Chinese or Japanese.n
