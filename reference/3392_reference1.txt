PM Narendra Modi on Wednesday launched the Integrated Case Management Information System (ICMIS) to help the Supreme Court go paperless. 
The system will help litigants access data and retrieve information online. 
It will help bring transparency, reduce manipulation and help the litigant know about the progress of the case on a real time basis, said CJI JS Khehar.
