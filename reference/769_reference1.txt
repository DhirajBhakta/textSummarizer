University of Mumbai (MU) hopes to declare the results of the examinations conducted this year between March and April by the second week of August, MU officials said. 
The university had adopted an on-screen assessment system which reportedly caused the delay, prompting protests. 
Several MU colleges have started post-graduate classes without the results being declared to avoid further delays.
