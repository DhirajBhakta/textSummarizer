A 32-year-old woman lawyer in Mumbai reportedly planned to jump off the 18th floor of an under-construction building and live-stream the suicide on social media. 
However, she was stopped from doing so in time as the police reached the spot and persuaded her against it. 
A resident of a nearby apartment had spotted the woman and informed the police.
