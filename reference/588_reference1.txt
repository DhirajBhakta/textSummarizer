Outgoing President Pranab Mukherjee had discontinued the term 'His Excellency' earlier used to address Presidents, during his tenure as the 13th President of the country. 
He instead asked the word 'Hon'ble' to be added before a designation. 
Further, he had also directed authorities to organise maximum events inside the Rashtrapati Bhavan to reduce inconvenience caused to the police and people.
