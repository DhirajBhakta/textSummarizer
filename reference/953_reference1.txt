China on Tuesday called for an immediate withdrawal of Indian troops that illegally crossed the boundary so as "to avoid escalation". 
China's Foreign Ministry said, "The illegal trespass by the Indian border personnel has drawn extensive attention from the international community." 
China also asserted that India should not use illegal trespass as a "policy tool" to realise its political targets.
