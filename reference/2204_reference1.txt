Commemorating 75 years of a mass roundup of French Jews outside Paris, French President Emmanuel Macron denounced his country's collaboration in the Holocaust atrocity. 
Adding that "not a single German" was directly involved in the roundup, Macron said, "it was indeed France that organised this". 
Notably, tens of thousands of Jews were killed in the atrocity.
