The Supreme Court has said it will examine whether IIT Kanpur can withhold the result of a student expelled in 2016 for sexually harassing a female student. 
The man had filed a plea for his result to be declared, saying he wasn't given a copy of the complaint. 
He also said he wasn't allowed to defend himself before the expulsion.
