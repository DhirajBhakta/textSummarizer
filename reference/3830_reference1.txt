The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has denied reports that its Class 12 textbook suggested that 36-24-36 was the ideal female body shape. "CBSE does not recommend books by any private publishers to the affiliate schools," the board stated. The book referred to in the media reports is titled 'Health and Physical Education', published by New Saraswati House.
