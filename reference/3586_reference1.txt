An association representing the members of the Indian Administrative Service (IAS) has said the officers will adopt families of security personnel who lost their lives in Maoist combats, anti-terror operations or law and order duties. The bureaucrats will approach such families within their area of posting and act as facilitators to help them get their dues, including jobs and pensions.
