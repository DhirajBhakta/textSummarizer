The Prime Minister's Office has sought a report from the Home Ministry on the allegations made by a BSF jawan on the quality of food provided to them in a video. 
"It's our responsibility to think about the welfare of our jawans. 
We have to check everything carefully. 
We take this issue very seriously," MoS for Home Kiren Rijiju said.
