Art of Living founder Sri Sri Ravi Shankar on Tuesday said the Centre, Delhi government, and the National Green Tribunal should be fined for allowing his foundation to organise the World Culture Festival on Yamuna floodplains in March 2016. 
"If the Yamuna was so fragile... they should have stopped the World Culture Festival," Sri Sri added.
