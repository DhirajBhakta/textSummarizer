A couple that got married on Tuesday morning lined up outside a polling station in Bhandup wearing wedding attires to cast their votes for the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) polls. 
"Some relatives objected to us leaving the rituals midway, but we convinced them and finally were allowed to go to the polling booth," the groom said.
