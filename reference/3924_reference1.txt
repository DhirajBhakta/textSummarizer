Shiv Sena MP Ravindra Gaikwad, banned from flying by major airlines after he assaulted an Air India staffer, reportedly reached Delhi via a chartered flight on Wednesday. 
The flight is believed to have been provided by Shiv Sena MP Rajkumar Dhoot. 
Previously, SpiceJet, Air India and IndiGo had cancelled Gaikwad's tickets and he had travelled to Delhi by road.
