A month-long study by the Centre for Science and Environment on 13 Delhi arterial roads has revealed that there is negligible difference between peak and non-peak hours for traffic. 
The study also found that vehicles were going 50%-60% slower than the speed the roads were originally built for. 
The analysis also indicated that traffic congestion is worse on weekends.
