A social activist has filed a Public Interest Litigation in the Bombay High Court demanding a 24-hour helpline against cow vigilantes. 
The activist, fearing that more attacks may follow during Bakra Eid, said that it is the duty of the state to protect its citizens. 
All the police stations should have names of gau-rakshaks under their jurisdiction, the petition demanded.
