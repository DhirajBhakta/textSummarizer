The ruling AIADMK party in Tamil Nadu on Monday said it would take legal action against Karnataka ex-DIG D Roopa if she did not withdraw her bribery charges against party chief VK Sasikala. 
The police officer had alleged that Sasikala was given special treatment and amenities in prison against rules. 
Notably, Sasikala was jailed in a disproportionate assets case.
