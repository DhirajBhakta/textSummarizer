Organs retrieved from a 32-year-old brain-dead man, who was admitted to a Mumbai hospital after multiple injuries, saved lives of four end-stage organ failure patients. 
The man's heart, liver, kidneys, eyes, and skin were donated. 
While the deceased's heart was transplanted into a 56-year-old man, his liver and kidney were transplanted into two patients.
