A 30-foot-long carcass of a whale was found washed ashore on Odisha's Puri beach on Monday. It is suspected that the mammal died after being hit by a ship or vessel in the deep sea. "Global warming, climate change, and increased pollution in seawater could be among reasons of death of sea mammals," a member of coastal protection body said.
