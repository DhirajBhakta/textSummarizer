At least two militants ransacked the house of a Superintendent of Police in Jammu and Kashmir's Kulgam district. 
The militants tried to scare his family members by firing in the air, but there were no reports of any injury. 
Notably, this comes after three civilians were killed in an incident where stone pelters clashed with the police in Budgam.
