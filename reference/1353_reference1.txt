A bus, carrying 35 students to Amity International School, caught fire near Gurugram's Huda City Centre metro station on Monday. 
The bus driver raised an alarm upon noticing smoke coming out of the bonnet and the students were safely evacuated. 
The incident will be probed and action will be taken if any laxity is found, said an official.
