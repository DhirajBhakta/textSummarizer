The anti-Romeo squad in Uttar Pradesh, which drew criticism for moral policing in the name of women safety, is coming back with a polite, observant and trained set of personnel. 
The state's DGP said the squad was being trained to distinguish a molester from a friend, adding there would be no more 'murga punishments', shaving of heads, blackening of faces.
