Pakistan is planning to export donkeys to China under its Donkey Development Programme, in a bid to attract Chinese investors in Pakistan's Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province. 
Pakistan is also aiming at increasing donkeys' population in its province as the animal is highly valued in China for its hide which is used to manufacture medicines.
