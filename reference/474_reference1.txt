Maharashtra's private law colleges have reportedly been allowed to revise their fees for the first time in nine years after they were brought under the control of the Fee Regulating Authority (FRA). 
While the colleges have welcomed the revision of fees, students reportedly demanded that the colleges need to upgrade themselves before charging extra fees.
