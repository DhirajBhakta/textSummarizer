Slamming the BJP for GST rollout, Congress leader Digvijaya Singh has said GST would not succeed and would give rise to inflation as well as confusion. 
"Celebrations took place at midnight as if the country has got second freedom", Singh said. 
He further added that the countries where the GST is successful, have a single tax slab structure.
