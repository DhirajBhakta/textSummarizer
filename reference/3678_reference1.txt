Union Minister Babul Supriyo has shared a photo of a yet-to-be-built bus stand in Gujarat's Rajkot while saying that it has already been inaugurated. The photo later turned out to be a computer-aided drawing of the bus stand. However, Supriyo later admitted that he had got the photo from a friend, and had "blindly" posted it with the same text.
