The Supreme Court on Friday dismissed a plea seeking its nod for terminating the 32-week-old pregnancy of a 10-year-old rape victim. 
The SC made the decision after taking note of a medical report stating that abortion was neither good for the girl nor the foetus. 
It is prohibited to terminate any pregnancy in India after 20 weeks without court's permission.n
