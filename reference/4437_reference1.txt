A probe has found that JNU student leader Kanhaiya Kumar did not raise anti-India slogans for which he was charged with sedition last year, according to India Today. 
Anti-India sloganeering took place in the JNU campus, but Kanhaiya's voice did not match the audio, the reports added. 
Most of the other slogan shouters were Kashmiri students, the probe added.
