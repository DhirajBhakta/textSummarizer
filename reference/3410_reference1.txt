The Jammu and Kashmir government has ordered a blackout of at least 34 TV channels, including those from Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Iraq. 
The channels include Geo News, Saudi Al Quran Al Kareem, Noor TV and Zakir Naik's Peace TV. 
The move comes amid reports that channels indulging in "anti-India" propaganda were being broadcast via private cable networks in Kashmir.
