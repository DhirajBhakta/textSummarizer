Father of Saifullah, the slain ISIS terror accused in the Lucknow shootout, has refused to accept his son's body, saying what his son has done was not in the country's interest. 
"We will not take the body of a traitor," Saifullah's father Sartaj added. 
During the encounter, Saifullah's family had asked him to surrender, but he did not listen.
