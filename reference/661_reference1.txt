A 16-year-old Class 10 student on Thursday gave birth to a premature baby girl in her school's washroom in Delhi's Mukherjee Nagar. 
Neither the girl's parents nor her teachers and classmates were aware of her 26-week pregnancy, reports said. 
Police said the girl was impregnated by her 51-year-old neighbour, who raped her eight times in as many months.
