Fungus-like organisms have been found fossilised in South African rocks dating back 2.4 billion years, pushing the oldest evidence of possible fungal life by at most 2 billion years. 
The fossils suggest it may have evolved underwater, scientists said. 
If not a fungus, the organism could be from an extinct branch of life that hasn't been described before, scientists added.
