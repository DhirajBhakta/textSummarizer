Kerala MP Innocent Vareed Thekkethala, President of the Association of Malayalam Movie Artists, said today that though casting couch no longer exists, bad actresses can opt for it. 
"The moment you make an imprudent request to a woman in this day and age, [t]hey will speak about it openly...But if the women are bad, they may share the bed".
