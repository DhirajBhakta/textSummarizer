Over four lakh saplings have been planted by the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) as a part of its green drive which began earlier this month. 
The NDMC aims to plant a total of 10 lakh indigenous trees such as babul, ber, amaltas, and peepal this monsoon. 
Central Delhi's resident welfare associations and market associations joined the drive this week.
