During his farewell speech on Sunday, outgoing President Pranab Mukherjee said that he was a creation of the Parliament. 
"The Parliament gave a direction to my political vision as I got to learn a lot from the serious discussions held in both Houses of the Parliament," he added. 
Notably, the first parliamentary session he attended was on July 22, 1969.
