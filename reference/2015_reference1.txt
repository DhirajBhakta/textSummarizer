A 15-year-old girl was allegedly drugged and gang raped by three men in East Delhi's New Ashok Nagar on Friday afternoon. 
All the accused were the girl's neighbours and were later arrested. 
The police said the girl had come to Delhi from Bihar a week ago to take care of her aunt and uncle who had met with an accident.
