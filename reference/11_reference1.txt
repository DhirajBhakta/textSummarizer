The mother of Harshit Sharma, the class 12 Chandigarh boy who got a hoax job offer call from Google, said that the incident "devastated" his life. He got a call, after which he shared the information with the school principal, who sent out a press release. Harshit is hospitalised since Google denied giving him a job, his mother added.
