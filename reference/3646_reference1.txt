Students in the Kashmir Valley clashed with security forces and resorted to stone pelting as colleges and universities reopened on Monday, officials said. Stone pelting by the students of a local college caused a blockade of one of the busiest roads in Srinagar, they added. The educational institutions had remained closed for a week following protests by the students.
