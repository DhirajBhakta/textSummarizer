President Pranab Mukherjee on Friday said India should aspire to become a global powerhouse not just in terms of GDP but also in terms of Gross National Happiness (GNH). 
"Along with GDP, GNH is considered as one of the important factors of development," Mukherjee added. "600 million youth are entering the job market, but their employability isn't adequate," Mukherjee said.
