A woman from Queensland, Australia received a call from the school informing her that her 5-year-old daughter had packed a raspberry vodka in her lunchbox. 
She had asked her daughter to take a pack of juice from the freezer but instead of juice, she accidentally took the vodka. 
"I apologised for not sending enough for the teachers," she jokingly said.
