Australia's Queensland is building a 2,000-kilometre network of electric vehicle charging stations, which will make up one of the longest electric vehicle highways in the world. The Electric Super Highway will be completed within six months. Its stations will offer free power for at least one year, in an attempt to boost the number of electric cars in Queensland.
