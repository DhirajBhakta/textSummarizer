The Gujarat government has decided to celebrate the 'World Heritage City' status granted to Ahmedabad by UNESCO for a fortnight. 
The programme, starting on August 1, will include heritage walks, cultural events, lectures and seminars about the 600-year-old city. 
Further, all flights to Gujarat will serve Gujarati cuisine to passengers during the 2-week-long celebration.
