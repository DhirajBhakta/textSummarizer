A new book detailing Nelson Mandela's last days has been withdrawn after it was condemned by his widow, the publisher Penguin Random House has announced, saying that it was in no way intended to be disrespectful. 
The book revealed several undignified episodes at the end of Mandela's life as well as family quarrels over his care and legacy.
