A Pakistani passport holder flew in from Dubai to the New Delhi's IGI Airport and claimed to be associated with the country's intelligence agency ISI on Friday. 
Muhammad Rafiq, who was to fly to Kathmandu next, was detained by security officials. 
During questioning, the 38-year-old said he had decided to leave the agency and stay in India.
