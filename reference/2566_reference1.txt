The Heritage Transport Museum in Gurugram will showcase one of the 12 antique Kolkata trams that were put on sale by the West Bengal State Transport Corporation. 
The first tram has been sold to a Chandigarh bidder, who reportedly wants to refurbish it into a restaurant. 
The wooden tram, no longer in working order, would be restored before getting displayed.
