The All Bengal Minority Youth Federation (ABMYF) has demanded the removal of Bangladesh's founder Mujibur Rahman's statue from the government-run Baker hostel in Kolkata, calling it "anti-Islamic". 
"Since the hostel has a mosque in its premises, such a statue could not be allowed," said ABMYF. 
The statue was installed by the then Left government in 1998.n
