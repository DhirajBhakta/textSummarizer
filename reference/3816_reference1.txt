The Danish Agriculture and Food Council has announced the relaunch of a project that recycles urine to make beer. The plan aims to collect urine from special urinals and storage tanks at a music festival called Roskilde, which will be used to fertilise malting barley. Suggestions for the name of the beer include 'pilsner', 'yellow ale' and 'pale piss'.
