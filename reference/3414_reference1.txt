Female IPS officer Charu Nigam, who broke down after an argument with a BJP MLA in Gorakhpur, has said her tears should not be mistaken as a sign of her weakness. 
"I just did not expect that my SP city Ganesh Saha Sir would outrightly reject the irrational argument and talk about my injury," said Nigam in a Facebook post.
