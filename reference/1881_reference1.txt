In view of the rise in crimes against women, the Centre has decided to set up 200 special investigating units in the most crime-prone districts. 
The Investigative Units on Crime Against Women will be set up on a 50:50 cost sharing basis with the states. 
Besides augmenting state machinery, the units would encourage women to come forward and lodge complaints.
