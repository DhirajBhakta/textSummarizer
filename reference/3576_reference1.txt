The first rail freight linking the UK to China reached the city of Yiwu on Saturday, covering 12,000 km in 20 days. 
The train loaded with British goods departed London on April 10 and passed through seven countries. 
The train which covered the world's second longest journey is a part of China's efforts to revive the Silk Road trading routes.
