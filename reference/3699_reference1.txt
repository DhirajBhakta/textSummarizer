The Supreme Court has agreed to hear a plea challenging the life sentence imposed on Abdul Latif Adam Momin alias Abdul Rehman, one of the convicts in the 1999 Kandahar hijacking case. 
He is one of the 10 people charged with the diverting Air India IC-814 to Afghanistan's Kandahar, while it was on its way from Kathmandu to Delhi.
