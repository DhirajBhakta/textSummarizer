The Central government has no accurate data on illegal migrants, Union Minister Kiren Rijiju said on Tuesday in Lok Sabha. Pointing out that these people entered India in a "clandestine and surreptitious manner," he said it would be "naturally" impossible to exact official figures. "We have taken various steps to ensure we detect them...and then prosecute them," he added.
