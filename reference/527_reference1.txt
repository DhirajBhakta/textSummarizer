Railway Ministry is planning to introduce an integrated ticketing system in the next three years, which will be first introduced in Mumbai on pilot basis. 
The system will provide all-in-one tickets for all public transportation in the city including BEST buses, local trains, Metros, black-and-yellow taxis and autorickshaws. 
The MMRDA will reportedly float a tender for the system in October.
