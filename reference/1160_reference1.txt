The Central Information Commission has ordered the Home Ministry to answer whether Indian National Army soldiers, who supported Subhas Chandra Bose, were freedom fighters or army deserters. 
An RTI has sought details on the status of INA soldiers. 
MHA should answer whether it was ready to provide same benefits such as pension to the INA soldiers, said CIC.
