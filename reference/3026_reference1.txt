A 24-year-old man suffered serious injuries after being beaten up for stopping a couple from kissing in public in Mumbai recently. 
According to police, the man was playing cricket near a college in Parel when he saw the couple kissing and asked them to stop the "obscene act". 
The boy then returned with his friends and thrashed the man.
