The construction of Gurugram's Iffco Chowk flyover has reportedly been delayed due to the presence of high tension electricity wires along the Delhi-Gurugram Expressway. 
The National Highways Authority of India officials said that Haryana Vidyut Prasaran Nigam failed to give permission to move the overhead high tension wires, even though it was earlier agreed upon by the two organisations.
