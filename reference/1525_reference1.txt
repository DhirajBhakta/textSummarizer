Several protesters sat throughout the night at Marina Beach in Chennai, demanding the continuation of bull-taming sport Jallikattu and a ban on animal rights group PETA. 
Further, lawyers in Namakkal district have announced a boycott of courts in protest. 
Notably, the Supreme Court had banned Jallikattu in May 2014 by terming it as cruelty to animals.
