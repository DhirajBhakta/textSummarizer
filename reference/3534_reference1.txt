Turkish President Recep Erdoan, who is on a one-day visit to India, met PM Narendra Modi and said that Turkey's $6.5 billion annual trade volume with India is "not enough" and should be boosted to $10 billion. Erdoan and Modi are also expected to discuss other strategic issues, including India's NSG membership bid and enhancing anti-terror cooperation during the visit.
