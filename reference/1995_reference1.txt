The Supreme Court on Monday observed that indiscipline by security personnel must be "viewed seriously" as disobeying orders of superior officers is an act of "gross misconduct". The apex court's remarks came while hearing a plea filed by CISF against the Delhi High Court's judgement directing reinstatement of a constable, who was dismissed for his alleged misconduct and indiscipline.
