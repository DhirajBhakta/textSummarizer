The Delhi Metro is planning to play instrumental music in its stations on the New Delhi-Dwarka Airport Line. 
An official said the decision was taken after a public survey revealed that 80% people wanted light music in stations. 
The Metro, which has applied for the required license, will introduce music on other stations and inside trains based on users' feedback.
