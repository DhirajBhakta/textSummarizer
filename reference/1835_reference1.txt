A woman from Bengaluru, Karnataka has filed a police complaint as she was fed up of seeing her husband dressed up in sari and wearing makeup. 
The woman is also seeking divorce from her husband. 
The couple had an arranged marriage a year ago. 
"Our marriage was not consummated due to impotency and congenital defects," said the woman.
