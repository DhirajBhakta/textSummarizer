Investigators have released pictures showing how close an Air Canada flight came to crashing onto four planes at a US airport last month. 
Its pilots mistakenly descended towards a taxiway, where four planes were parked, instead of the runway before aborting the landing. 
Investigators said the incident came within a few feet of becoming one of the worst aviation disasters.
