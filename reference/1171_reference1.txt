The Haryana government has sought from the Centre 5,600 paramilitary personnel to deal with Jat quota stir. 
The agitation in Haryana seeking reservation in education and government jobs entered its 17th day on Tuesday. 
Though agitation has been peaceful so far, but the Jat leaders have threatened to intensify the stir after February 19 if demands were not met.
