Bihar's newly appointed Deputy CM Sushil Modi said he would soon hold a press conference to "make a big expose" on Lalu Prasad's family and RJD's links with sand mafia. 
The government was committed to taking actions against anyone involved in corruption, he added. 
RJD's Bihar unit spokesperson dismissed Modi's allegations as "baseless and absurd".
