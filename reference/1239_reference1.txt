Mehbooba Mufti-led BJP-PDP government has opposed the creation of a minority commission in Jammu and Kashmir. "In the absence of a minority commission, the benefits exclusively meant for the minority communities are being given away to the majority Muslim community," a PIL filed in the Supreme Court had stated. Several states, UTs haven't set up minority commission, said the government.
