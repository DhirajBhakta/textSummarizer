After US President Donald Trump barred its citizens from entering the US, Iran on Sunday said it would block entry for American citizens to the country until the US government withdraws its decision. Calling Trump's decision "an open affront against the Iranian nation and Muslim world", Iran said it will be recorded in history as "a great gift to extremists".
