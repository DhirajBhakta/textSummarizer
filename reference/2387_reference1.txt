An inter-caste couple in Tamil Nadu's Erode district sought police protection after marrying against the wishes of the woman's parents. 
The couple feared they would be killed if they went back to their hometown since they belong to different castes. 
The Kongu belt, from where the couple hails, is reportedly infamous for incidents of honour killing.
