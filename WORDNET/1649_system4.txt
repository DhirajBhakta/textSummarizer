Passing a "cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any future violations" order against Mondelez last week, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said, Mondelez shall "pay a civil penalty in the amount of USD 13 million (Rs 88.5 crore) to the Securities and Exchange Commission for transfer to the general fund of the United States Treasury". 
Commenting on the development, a company spokesperson said: "Mondelez International Inc and Cadbury Limited are pleased to have reached an agreement with the SEC to settle charges related to internal controls and books-and-records provisions of the FCPA, without admitting or denying the charges."
