Soni feels that the only thing that  her daughter needs to do now is continue with her hard work. ?
She should just stay dedicated to her craft and the rest will fall in place. 
says the actor-director, who has been a part of films such as Saaransh (1984), Sadak (1991) and Monsoon Wedding (2001).    
But if you ask me to choose the ones I loved, I would say she impressed me with her performances in Udta Punjab, Highway and Dear Zindagi (2016). 
But as I always say an actor is never bigger than her role. 
So I feel she is lucky to have got such opportunities.
