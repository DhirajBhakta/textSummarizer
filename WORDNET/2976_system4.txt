The mask, that dates back to about 1000 BC, was found at a site where adults and children were buried. 
Holes mark the position of the masks eyes, nose and mouth, with additional small, circular openings near the edges that could have been threaded to secure it to a face or an object. 
Scientists from University of Buenos Aires in Argentina also found a source of copper ore within 70 kilometres of the location where the mask was uncovered, suggesting that it was produced locally. 
There were about 14 bodies in the burial area, with the bones all mixed together and the mask placed on top of one corner of the pile.
