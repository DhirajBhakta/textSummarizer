For more than 17 years, a family of five from Goregaon (East) has been planting saplings across Aarey Milk Colony during the monsoon and caring for them till they become full-grown trees. 
We took care of them and today, it is a dense forest with 75 varieties of trees. 
Trees should be taken care of for at least next three to four years. 
s death, Sandeep, his wife and his mother took up the initiative to plant 2,000 saplings in Aarey. 
he said, adding that his son Malhar has planted saplings all by himself and loves to be in the company of butterflies.Their efforts come at a time when Aarey is being besieged by several development projects. 
Initially, we bought our own saplings and planted them, but after a while we began receiving donations and saplings from different groups that joined us on weekends,?
