A 30-year-old Indian woman, who was on her way to Iceland from Bengaluru, was asked to strip by security officers at the Frankfurt airport in Germany this week.It was only after the woman insisted that her husband, a native of Iceland, walk into the room that the security officials backed out. ? "Are brown people not suspicious if we have European partners or co-travellers?" 
I was taken into a room and was asked to lift my dress/ take it off so that I could be checked to make sure I wasn't 'carrying anything under my clothes'", she wrote in her Facebook post.Shruthi alleges it was a case of racial profiling.This is not the first time something like this happened with her.
