It was last week that Kriti Sanon posted a video where she is dancing to a song from Mubarakan. 
Immediately Kamaal R Khan, the serial offender, posted a tasteless comment on the actor targeting the poor box office performnce of Kriti?
Adding her voice to the chorus was actor Bhairavi Goswami who last appeared in Hate Story.Taking to Twitter, Bhairavi wrote, ?
The crass tweet soon got a serious backlash on Twitter with many questioning who Bhairavi was.But the best reaction, by far, has been that of Kriti herself. 
I think, I?
She got a lot of publicity. 
Now you guys know her name also, so yeah.?
