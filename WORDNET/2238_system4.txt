Originally, those who had cleared Class 10 and 12 from state or had a domicile certificate were eligible for state quota seats. 
Those who have cleared Class 12 from Maharashtra, even without Class 10 from the state, will be eligible for state quota seats from now,? 
said Dr Pravin Shingare, director of DMER.Parents said the purpose of state quota seats was being defeated as most students from the state were losing out on seats in state-run and private institutes due to this change in eligibility criteria. ?
Thousands of students apply for seat in Maharashtra medical and dental institutes and document verification will decide whether all those who have applied are eligible for state quota seats.
