Floyd Mayweather has said he will come out of retirement to fight Conor McGregor but only if he gets paid $100m (?82m) and the Irish UFC star is prepared to take a career-high $15m (?12m), plus a minor slice of the pay-per-view revenue.Meanwhile, the 38-year-old Manny Pacquiao, who had been hoping for a rematch with Mayweather, has agreed to defend his WBO welterweight title against a little-known Queensland schoolteacher, Jeff Horn, in Brisbane in April, according to unconfirmed reports in Australia.
