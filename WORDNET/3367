Ludhiana, May 12 (PTI) A Ludhiana court has issued a fresh non-bailable warrant against actress Rakhi Sawant for allegedly making objectionable remarks against sage Valmiki, who wrote the Hindu epic Ramayana. The court of Judicial Magistrate Vishav Gupta yesterday fixed June 2 as the next date for hearing in the case. A local advocate Narinder Adiya had filed a complaint against Rakhi on July 9 last year alleging that she had hurt the religious sentiments of the Valmiki community by making derogatory comments against the sage. On the last date on April ten, Rakhi had withdrawn the anticipatory bail application from the court.
