one of the people cited above said.That is also close to the 15.7 billion of old 500-rupee notes (amounting to Rs7.85 trillion) withdrawn from circulation after November 8.Not all the new notes printed so far have been released into circulation by the central bank.RBI data shows that currency in circulation stood at Rs 15.22 trillion as on 14 July, eight months after demonetisation.
