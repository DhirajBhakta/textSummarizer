These libraries are unique in their own way as they have been put together from the citizen local area development fund, or Swaraj fund, and were taken up after people chose them as priority projects in mohalla sabhas conducted in various assembly constituencies last year. 
Though the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has started working on projects promised during the Mohalla Sabhas, the fate of Swaraj fund for the current fiscal (2016-17) itself hangs in balance.Officials say that the constitution of mohalla sabhas and creating a project management unit under it are yet to get approval from the Lieutenant Governor. 
In June, the Arvind Kejriwal cabinet had cleared a proposal to constitute 2,972 mohalla sabhas, besides creating a project management unit (PMU) called Mission Swaraj to co-ordinate the entire project.
