New Delhi, Jul 4 (PTI) Clearing the air on unsold stocks of goods post GST implementation, the government today allowed use of stickers with revised rates, alongside the printed MRP for pre-packaged items, for three months to reflect changes in selling price. 
On items where the price has to be increased for unsold stocks, the manufacturer or packer or importer will have to give at least two advertisements in two or more newspapers informing people about the change. 
Declaration of the changed MRP shall be made by way of stamping or putting sticker or online printing," a government notification said. 
The difference between the retail sale price originally printed on the package and the revised price "shall not, in any case, be higher than the extent of increase in tax" or in the case of imposition of fresh tax on account of the implementation of the GST, it said
