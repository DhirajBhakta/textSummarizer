?COUPLE TRACED TO KORMANGALA APARTMENT Based on the missing complaint filed by the younger woman's family, the police initiated a search operation and traced them to an apartment in Koramangala.The couple tried to seek help of an NGO to fight their case and also to let their family and police know that they are happy together and as adults have taken their own decisions.As of now , the police is perplexed as to how to pursue this case, while the 'wife' is undergoing counseling.While many feel that the whole idea of criminalising homosexuality was to bring sanity in society, but legal experts feel that the SC order was clear that one cannot be booked for being lesbian or gay.
