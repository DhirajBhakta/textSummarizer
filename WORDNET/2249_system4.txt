A 159-year-old co-educational school in West Bengal has adopted a segregation policy after complaints of boys harassing the girls.According to the plan for classes 11 and 12 at Barhra high school, boys attend classes on Monday, Wednesday and Friday, while girls are taught on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday.?
After getting several complaints from the students of classes 11 and 12 that the boys create trouble, we were forced to take the decision of asking them to attend school on separate days,? 
headmaster Kanchan Adhikari said.The decision was taken at a meeting of the school?
The school authorities have taken a strange decision,?
