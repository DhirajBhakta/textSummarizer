With TV shows focusing on naagins, men having two wives and actors turning into flies and other animals, many feel that TV has now  become regressive.

People who find the naagin concept regressive,  ask them if they watch international shows on vampires. 
We all know  that audience there loves supernatural and sci-fi shows and how a lot of us here enjoy watching them. 
So what is the problem with TV showing such shows? 
But for sure, the quality of such shows can be made better treatment wise.
