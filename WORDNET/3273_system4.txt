New Delhi, May 20 (PTI) Commerce Minister Nirmala Sitharaman today sought to calm frayed nerves on the contentious visa issue, saying the number of H-1B visas for Indian IT professionals would not come down. 
"No need to get panicky on the visa front. 
The selection for such visas is getting selective, but the "numbers are not changing". 
"No need of getting panicky... because the number of H-1B visas that we have got, we will continue to get that," she promised. 
US President Donald Trump in April had signed an executive order for tightening the H-1B visa programme to stop its "abuse" and ensure the visas are given to the "most- skilled or highest paid" petitioners, a decision that is seen to impact Indias USD 150 billion IT industry.
