Funny as it may sound, this temple is offering a pen set that can solve all life's problem for students in distress.A shabbily designed hand bill issued by the Kashthabhanjan Temple in Gujarat's Panchmahal district has gone viral on social media raising many eyebrows as well as triggering mirthful comments.Dushyant Bapuji, who identifies himself as a Hanuman sevak, has said in the handbill that this pen was made using the divinity acquired by performing a Hanuman Saraswati Yagya.Comments ranged from calling it farce to youth self-assured posts like, "brilliant, now play and have fun throughout the year and by Bapuji's pen for exams."
