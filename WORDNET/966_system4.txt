Two municipal bodies and an association of industries will have to pay Rs96 crore for polluting the Ulhas River in Thane, after the Supreme Court vacated a Bombay high court order that had put on hold the penalty.On July 5, the SC passed an order staying the HC judgement, which had put on hold a 2015 National Green Tribunal (NGT) order. 
The SC order, which was made public on Monday, effectively stays all previous orders of the HC in this matter.The SC said the civic bodies and the industries have the option of either filing a review in the NGT or taking the matter to the SC itself, within three weeks.In July 2015, the western bench of the NGT had passed a judgement indicting the Dombivli Industries Association (DBESA), Kalyan Dombivli Municipal Corporation, Ambernath Municipal Council and the Ulhasnagar Municipal Corporation of polluting the Ulhas River with untreated effluents and raw sewage.
