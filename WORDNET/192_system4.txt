The Hungarian Grand Prix could yet stand as one of the defining moments of the 2017 Formula One season.Under the unyielding sun of a Budapest summer the two title protagonists, who have been equally unforgiving on track in a battle that has swayed gloriously between them, finally showed their hands as to how that fight would proceed in the second half of the season.Sebastian Vettel won what was hardly a classic race but Lewis Hamilton, in standing by his team-mate, admitted he might have dropped points that could ultimately cost him the world championship.Vettel won at the Hungaroring with an impressive drive from pole position. 
Their step forward to go head-to head with Mercedes this season gives them a real opportunity to end the drought.Raikkonen might have been passed by Hamilton, which would have cost them constructor points, but they opted to gamble on the British driver being unable to do so.
