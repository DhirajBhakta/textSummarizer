Heaping praises on Hashim Amla, South Africa's Test skipper Faf du Plessis said the prolific batsman could be the last Protea to play 100 Tests.The 33-year-old Amla is set to make his 100th Test appearance in the third and final match against Sri Lanka on Thursday, which du Plessis termed as something "really special"."
I am going to make a big call and say Hash (Amla) is probably going to be the last guy that plays 100 Tests for South Africa because of the way that the game is changing. 
It's a massive call to make. 
Test cricket these days...the game has evolved so much," du Plessis was quoted as saying by espncricinfo."
