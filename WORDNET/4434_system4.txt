"It was not notebandi but nasbandi, carried out by the Modi government on crores of people, who were forced to stand in queue for withdrawing their own money from the banks," said Lalu, launching a scathing attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi. 
Lalu attacked Modi while addressing an election campaign rally here in support the SP-Congress alliance candidate and dubbed the Prime Minister as twin brother of US President Donald Trump, saying "no one knows what will the two do next." 
"Sonia Gandhi is the bahu (daughter-in-law) of India, she is no more a foreigner for us," he said attacking the PM and inadvertently raking up Gandhis foreign origin issue. 
It was not clear what made Lalu suddenly assert Gandhis identity as an Indian.
