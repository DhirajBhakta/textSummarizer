From Yoshita Singh New York, Feb 12 (PTI) Microsoft has to "look like everyone and every organisation in the world" for it to accomplish its mission, the technology giants Indian-born CEO Satya Nadella has said, asserting the importance of "diversity and inclusion" amid an environment of divisiveness. 
That means we have got to look like everyone and every organisation in the world," Nadella said during an interaction with students and faculty at New York Universitys Tandon School of Engineering and the Stern School of Business last week. 
Ill say we are going to, everyday of the week, push to get better and better at creating that more inclusive culture. 
The more you take responsibility for it, the more you feel empowered to change culture versus being stuck in some culture you dont like," he said.
