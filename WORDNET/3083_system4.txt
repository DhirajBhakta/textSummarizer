Mumbai, Jun 6 (PTI) Jet Airways domestic pilots body NAG will convene a meeting tomorrow to chart out an "action plan" following the questioning of some of its members by the Delhi Police over alleged posting of obscene messages on a WhatsApp group. 
The National Aviators Guild (NAG), which claims representation of around 1,000 of the Jet Airways 1,500 pilots, would also coordinate with the two pilot unions of government-run Air India -- ICPA and IPG -- over the issue, a Guild member said today. 
"This is unprecedented as our members (pilots) were called by the DGCA for a meeting for some other issue and they had no idea that this was for some thing," the Guild member said.
