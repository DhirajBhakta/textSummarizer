New Delhi, Dec 11 (PTI) Following reports about shortage of ventilators in Delhi government-run hospitals, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal today pulled up Health Minister Satyendar Jain who in turn sought to shift the blame onto Lt Governor Najeeb Jung, accusing the Health Secretary appointed by him of not reaching the hospital to deal with a case of medical negligence citing unavailability of car. 
According to sources in the Delhi governments Health Department, Jain had received an information about a patient, having died yesterday in Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narayan Hospital as he was allegedly unable to get ventilator support, and was going to the hospital to check the ground reality.
