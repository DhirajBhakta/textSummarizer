Yasuko Shimizu, the chief of mission for UNHCR in India and the Maldives, who was awarded the Indira Gandhi Prize for Peace, Disarmament and Development 2015, said that the country has helped refugees by providing work permits and issuing long term visas. 
The country has given opportunities for such people to go for jobs by providing work permits. 
Although we give refugee cards to displaced people but the government here issues long term visas for them which is very helpful," Shimizu said. 
She said that the UNHCR has taken several initiatives in collaboration with governments and local bodies on ground, to address issues concerning proper education for children belonging to such communities.
