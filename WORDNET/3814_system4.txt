On learning this I requested the key officer of the censor board of Pakistan to at least view the film and then take a decision. 
The Pakistan censor board reportedly asked the film's makers for two cuts, the scene where the Indian national anthem was played and portions showing the Indian national flag. 
Producer Aamir Khan refused to abide by the two cuts and chose not to release the film in the neighboring country.More recently, Tapsee Pannu's Naam Shabana didn't see the light of day in Pakistan, due to 'terrorism-related scenes,' and Jolly LLB 2 too irked the Pakistan authorities since it had discussions around the Kashmir issue.
