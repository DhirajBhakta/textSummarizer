Touched by Swaraj's prompt response, Asif praised Swaraj and even said that Pakistan would have changed had she been the prime minister of her country. 
Rest assured we will follow it up," the Indian High Commission said in a tweet. 
'HE SAID IT'S ALL UP TO YOU' Responding to Asif's plea, Swaraj also wondered whether Pakistan Prime Minister's Foreign Affairs Advisor Satraj Aziz had refused to issue a recommendation letter for the issuance of a visa by India to the patent. 
The External Affairs minister had a few weeks back said that Pakistani nationals seeking visas for medical treatment in India must accompany their visa applications with a recommendation letter by Aziz. 
In another tweet, she said "my heart belongs and beats for you", adding that "Pakistan doesn't deserve her at all".
