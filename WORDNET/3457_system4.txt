From Natasha Chaku Melbourne, May 5 (PTI)?For the first time, Australia will sell Kesar variety of Indian mangoes with the inaugural consignment of nearly 400 trays landing in Sydney, but marketing firms called it a "little disappointing" as the fruit was a little blemish and not evenly coloured. 
"The first consignment, Ive got to say, was a little disappointing," PFA chief executive Michael Simonetta said, adding "the fruit had a little bit of blemish on the skin and wasnt as evenly coloured as we expected it to be, so were in the process now of getting it to colour more evenly and then offer it for sale following that." 
"The variety Im really excited about, is in a few weeks time well bring in the Alphonso mango which is known as the king of mango," he said.
