The scheme would be an accident insurance scheme with one year cover, renewable annually, offering accidental death and disability cover. In the first instance, the premium of Rs 12 per annum will be deducted from the account holders savings bank account through auto-debit facility in one instalment on or before June 1 of each annual coverage period under the scheme, which, in turn, will be reimbursed by the state by direct credit to the beneficiary account on receipt of information from bank, he said. The accident cover for the member would terminate on attaining the age of 70 years or closure of the account with the bank or insufficiency of balance at the time of renewal to keep the insurance in force, the official said. Similarly, if the insurance cover is ceased due to any technical reasons, the risk cover will be suspended and reinstatement of risk cover will be at the sole discretion of insurance company.
