From my point of view, it's only about how best I can play that character.What would you do to get into the Baahubali mindset before getting on to the sets?I just went into this project with the attitude that I would do my best; even if part one didn't work, I would still do part two with the same dedication. I always dreamed big as an actor but the way things turned out, I never imagined it would be this big.There are perhaps children who look up to you today as a superhero just as you did while you were young.Well, I feel lucky for that. Perhaps I was always so content and comfortable with my extended family that I didn't quite go out and make too many friends.
