s Sangam Vihar area on Tuesday night.On Monday, Yogesh and his mother Mamta Devi, who run a dairy shop on the ground floor of their house, were at the counter when two youths came to buy cottage cheese around 9pm. 
I told them that I do not have any left and that they can buy it in the morning once I get the fresh stock but they forcefully entered the shop and started checking the refrigerator,? 
When I raised an alarm, the youths left the shop but threatened to return. 
I went to see if he was fine and saw a group of boys running out of the shop,?
