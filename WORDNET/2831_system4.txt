Three-time world champion Lewis Hamilton has branded Sebastian Vettel a disgrace after the latter deliberately drove into him at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix and demanded that, if they are to clash, they should do so like "men" outside the car.Vettel earned himself a 10-second stop-go penalty and moved to within three points of a one-race ban for driving up alongside Hamilton during the race, raising his right arm and slamming into the No.44 car.An angry German was protesting what he had perceived to be a brake-test from the Briton while the three-time world champion was managing the pace under the Safety Car, though the data later showed Vettel's assumption to be incorrect."
Driving alongside and deliberately driving into a driver and getting away scot-free pretty much - he still came away with fourth - I think that's a disgrace," Hamilton was quoted as saying by the Guardian."
If I get a penalty, then we should both get a penalty," he added.The 29-year-old said he had not intended to hit Hamilton when he drew alongside him"We had a little contact, but I drove alongside him mostly to raise my hand.
