Dr Sushil Kumar, senior scientist at WIHG,? explained the Indian Plate is moving towards the Eurasian Plate at the speed of 45 mm/year causing immense pressure under the earth surface in the region, a report in Jagran  said.The Himalayan region has had four major earthquakes in the past 150 years. 
Sometime in the geological past, before humans, India broke off from an ancient supercontinent called Gondwana, a name still used for what is now Chhattisgarh.The Indian plate skewed north, displaced an ancient sea, travelled more than 2,000 km - the fastest a plate has ever moved - and slammed into the Eurasian plate, creating the Himalayas.About 60 per cent of India is vulnerable to earthquakes caused by the great, northward grind of the Indian subcontinental landmass.according to geologists, the 1950 Assam earthquake may have geologically set the stage for a really big one in the Himalayas.
