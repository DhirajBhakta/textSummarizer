The new HE1 use a completely new amplifier concept that combines the superior impulse processing of a tube amplifier with the low distortion of a transistor amplifier "to perfection" according to the company. 
The tube amplifier stage is followed by a patented ultra-high impulse amplifier stage that is directly integrated into the cups of the headphones.Senheiser has used gold-vaporised ceramic electrodes in the headphones. 
Just like the tubes of the tube amplifier, the system's MOS-FET transistors have a square characteristic curve to prevent the hard distortion that occurs in amplifiers with bi-polar transistors.Sennheiser uses a new amplifier concept in a class that the audio specialist calls Cool Class A.
