Instead of fishing for cash in their pockets to donate at temples, devotees can use  mobile phones to transfer donations to the e-wallets of the holy places. 
The priest at Shri Hanuman Balaji Temple in Gyan Khand-4 in Indirapuram has put up information on the donation box of the temple asking devotees to pay through Paytm. 
According to the temple priest, the move was initiated because the amount of donations fell after demonetisation was announced on November 8.?
Pandey said the number of people holding community feasts has also reduced.?
Money from community feasts (bhandara) used to be a major source of donations as one such feast would get us between Rs3,000 and Rs5,000.
