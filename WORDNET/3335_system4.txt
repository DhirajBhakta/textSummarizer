Both parties had agreed that the question of jurisdiction would be decided first and only then would the issue of merits be taken up.Guillaume said the court would first have to decide whether it had the jurisdiction to go into the case as contended by New Delhi after the Indian delegation led by the then Attorney General Soli Sorabjee, raised preliminary objections to its jurisdiction.Pakistan opened the first round of oral arguments, India replying them, and then Pakistan following with its second round, with India making its response thereto.INDIA'S ARGUMENTSIndia argued that the court did not have jurisdiction in the matter, citing an exemption it had filed way back in 1974 to exclude disputes between India and other Commonwealth states, and disputes covered by multilateral treaties.Sorabjee told the court that Pakistan was 'solely responsible' for the incident and Islamabad must 'bear the consequences of its own acts.'
