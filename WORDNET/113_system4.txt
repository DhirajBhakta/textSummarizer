The BJP-led Goa government on Tuesday told the state legislative assembly that strict action would be taken against the people found drinking on the state beaches, and if need be, they could even be arrested.?
At a meeting held in Calangute that month, citizens had complained about drinking on beaches as well other public places and no action being taken against them.Meanwhile, replying to another question, the state on Tuesday refused to withdraw the contract signed with the lifeguard agency to man the beaches, claiming that the government could not run such services.?
If Goans are available to take over this contract, then they can come ahead.
