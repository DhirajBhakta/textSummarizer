Now a signed and dated copy is about to be auctioned.Snapped by United Press International photographer Arthur Sasse as Einstein departed in the back of car following his 72nd birthday celebrations in 1951, the image shot into the public consciousness after publishers overcame their initial qualms and printed the jovial image.Even the Nobel laureate himself was amused at the photo, requesting cropped copies which he then signed and gave to friends. 
But the current auctioneers note that the image that is set to go under the hammer on 27 July is unusual in also showing the companions who left the Princeton club with Einstein that night: Frank Aydelotte, director of the Institute of Advanced Study at Princeton, where Einstein worked, and Aydelotte?
