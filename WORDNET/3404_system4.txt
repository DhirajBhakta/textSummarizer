The results summarised predictions of existing sound levels, estimates of natural sound levels, and the amount that human-made noise raises levels above natural levels, which is considered noise pollution. 
Researchers found that human-made noise doubled background sound levels in 63 per cent of US protected areas, and caused a ten-fold or greater increase in background levels in 21 per cent of protected areas. 
This reduced capacity to hear natural sound reduces the restorative properties of spending time in nature, such as mood enhancement and stress reduction, interfering with the enjoyment typically experienced by park visitors. 
"The noise levels we found can be harmful to visitor experiences in these areas, and can be harmful to human health, and to wildlife," said Rachel Buxton, from Warner College of Natural Resources in the US. 
"We were encouraged to see that many large wilderness areas have sound levels that are close to natural levels.
