The tax department has charged the party with not filing a "true and correct" contribution report for donations received for the assessment year 2014-15 which have been found to be over Rs 30.08 crore after year long investigations. 
The notice said that in view of these charges, the department seeks to file a prosecution complaint (charge sheet) under I-T laws in a court under sections 277A (false statement in verification) and 276C (wilful attempt to evade tax). 
The notice while acknowledging that the party had accepted that there were "certain errors" in its first report filed in this regard, added that this admission by the AAP was itself an evidence that its audit report was fabricated initially but was corrected after the taxman began investigations of its audit books and accounts.
