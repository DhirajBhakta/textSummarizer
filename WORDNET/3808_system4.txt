The Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) has given information about it on its website," Hazare said in the letter made public today. 
Bringing changes in the RTI Act, which people have got after years of agitations, is like damaging their fundamental right. 
The government has proposed a new set of rules for processing Right to Information applications, complaints and appeals and has sought suggestions from the public by April 15. 
Hazare said he was opposed to the proposed change in allowing withdrawal of appeal to the CIC. 
Pointing out that there have been 56 cases of murder of RTI applicant in the last year, Hazare said the proposed change will make the things more dangerous.
