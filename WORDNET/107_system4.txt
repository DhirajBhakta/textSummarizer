Director Hansal Mehta has trashed all speculation around the Kangana Ranaut-starrer Simran, saying that they are "false, malicious and totally fabricated".Mehta dismissed the reports that Kangana had taken over editing of the trailer after being unhappy over the first cut. 
I would never say anything that could remotely even hurt or upset somebody I love so dearly and to whom I am so grateful," he added.Co-producer Bhushan Kumar said he is saddened by the reports as they put the film in a negative light. 
At the end, the film is a director's vision and the film campaign will stay close to that only," Kumar said.Simran is set to release on September 15.
