The beef festival coincides with the visit of Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh, who arrived in Aizawl today to hold a meeting of chief ministers of the states sharing borders with Mynamar.The security arrangement for Rajnath Singh's visit to Aizawl was beefed up in the wake of beef festival organised by ZOlife Group and some activists. 
Remruata Varte, one of the organizers said that the entire state stands together in opposing the 'beef ban' by BJP government at the Centre.Beef is an integral part of the food habits of the people in the region and no one will compromise for the same, Varte said.This of course comes as a big set-back for the BJP leaders who have been camping in the region trying to garner support for impending elections in the state.
