Not thoughts or feelings, but trending hashtags tell us where to draw daggers, and how deep.And before we hit the jugular, we are wowed  by another trend, another bend, and we unflinchingly take the leap.Dog thrown from a roof, child fallen in a well,Valentine villains volley, kittens rescued from hell.Perverted politicians exposed, potholes all the way, #SelfieWithMamma is trending; smile, its mothers day.Then there?
And if it endures, persists and kicks back, Of a new hashtag it may be found able.The stray thought will then be co-opted,A following of its own it will make.And when it starts to believe its own legend,fast fingers will claw at its facade.After all, we are the mob and the mob is us.Apurva was recently in news when he got into a row with Kangana Ranaut over the writing credits of Hansal Mehta?
