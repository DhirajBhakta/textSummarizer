Pakistan Cricket Board chief Shaharyar Khan has said India are scared of playing Pakistan after losing the Champions Trophy final at The Oval on June 18. 
That was the only series between the arch-rivals since the 2008 terror attacks in Mumbai.However, the two countries have continued to play at ICC events with India enjoying a clear upper-hand. 
Pakpassion.com reported that Shaharyar, the outgoing PCB chief, felt India continue to refuse to play bilateral cricket with Pakistan because "they are scared of our team.""
They say we'll play you in ICC matches but they won't play us otherwise," Shaharyar said at the Pakistani Prime Minister's reception of the Pakistan team.
