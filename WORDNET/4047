Washington, Mar 27 (PTI) A 38-year-old woman in the US, who was apprehended twice for allegedly trying to jump the White House fence last week, has been arrested for scaling a fence at the Treasury Building. Wahl was first arrested on March 21 last week for trying to jump the White House fence. On March 21, officers saw Wahl walking and staring at the White House complex before discovering she had jumped a fence on the south side but got stuck. Officers found her hanging from the inside of the fence by her shoelaces, which were "caught on top of the fence," according to a police report.
