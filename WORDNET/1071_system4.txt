Dhoni has been a jewel in Indian cricket, he has won almost everything in the 8-9 years of his captaincy and even though the franchise can say they run the team with their own money, shouldn't they have seen Dhoni's stature and credibility before first stripping him of captaincy and then not even letting Dhoni the grace? 
(Dhoni as Indian Premier League skipper: Two titles, 83 wins)(WATCH VIDEO HERE) Dhoni was replaced with Australian captain Steve Smith and the Pune franchise owner Sanjiv Goenka had said the team needed a young captain with vision and zest to lead them in the IPL this year.Goenka also made it a point to emphasise and re-emphasise that "Dhoni himself had no say in the decision and that he was sacked" after the team had finished seventh last year - incidentally the first of the two years the franchise has been permitted to stay in the IPL.
