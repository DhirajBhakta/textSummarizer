"It is a matter of extreme surprise that the Lower House does not take into account this territory, whereas the State Legislature of Jammu and Kashmir keeps 25 seats vacant for the territory which is under illegal occupation of Pakistan," said Nishikant Dubey, who has piloted the bill. 
"It would be proper that seats provided for the Jammu and Kashmir area, which is under illegal occupation of Pakistan, in the Lok Sabha are kept vacant as elections can not be held in these areas," he said. 
At the same time, these seats shall not be taken into account for reckoning the total membership of both houses and the said area shall be excluded in delimiting the territorial constituencies, the bill proposes.
