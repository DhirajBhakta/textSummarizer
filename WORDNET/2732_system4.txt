The Bhutan side does not know previously that Indian troops entered Doklam which is not in line with what India claims," said spokesperson Geng Shuang, contradicting India's Friday statement that the Royal Bhutan Army had on June 16 protested the PLA's construction activities in Doklam, with the Indian Army two days later supporting Bhutan and asking China to stop altering the status quo.China's Foreign Ministry also said that Jawaharlal Nehru "explicitly recognised" the 1890 Sikkim-Tibet treaty that Beijing is now citing to back its territorial claims.In the very same March 22, 1959 letter, Nehru also reminded China of an 1842 treaty on Ladakh and the drawing of the McMahon line in Simla in 1914, which aren't recognised by China.
