Pramod, a 35-year-old man from Chikkamagaluru, Bengaluru who was working as a manager in one of the most popular chain of cafes, Cafe Coffee Day committed suicide. 
Pramod, who was working with the company since 11 years was promised a raise by his senior officers many time, was working undue stress and pressure. 
Pramod was working in Mahadevapura's Phoenix mall branch for the past 11 years. 
He blamed Cafe Coffee Day for making false promises and withholding salaries when the target wasn't met. 
I was working in Bangalore. 
All are working for the sake of making their ends meet, for the daily bread.
