Earlier in teh day a second tram was sold to the heritage Transport Museum in Manesar, Gurgaon.An official of the department said that WBSTC has some 130-140 trams in working order. 
However only about 80-90 trams are pressed into service daily as tram routes have shrunk and the ongoing metro work has also hampered operations in a few routes.The Heritage Transport Museum in Manesar is a private museum that showcases the evolution of transportation in India. 
Innovative Indian transports like the famous 'jugaad' - basically a water pump powering a four wheeled platform find a place beside two wheelers - both bikes and scooters of vintage flavour.
