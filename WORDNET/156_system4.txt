 The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) is finding it tough to finalise construction of a flyover at Iffco chowk due to the presence of high tension overhead electricity wires.The flyover construction is complete except for a portion where the high tension wires are running along the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway from Shankar Chowk to Iffco Chowk. 
The NHAI has repeatedly asked the power company to shift the lines but to no avail.The NHAI officials said the Haryana Vidyut Prasaran Nigam (HVPN), which is the custodian authority of the high tension wires, failed to give permission to move the wires to order to complete the flyover.
