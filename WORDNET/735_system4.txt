New Delhi, Jul 21 (PTI) Industry body COAI today termed the launch of JioPhone a "clever marketing" and said Jio selling the device at effective zero price is an attempt to save government levies like licence fee by the company. 
COAI Director General Rajan S Mathews said the Jios announcement is a bundled offer and the plan to sell it at an "effective zero price" is a "clever marketing position" as the move will help the company save licence fee and other government levies. 
So as an operator one cant compete with a handset seller because handset seller is not required to pay this extra levy of 11-14 per cent," Mathews said. 
He said a bundled offer would have increased cost of providing service for operators.
