The lynching was widely condemned across ideological leanings in the Valley and across the country.Describing the events of the night, Khan said 57-year-old Pandith, who was in plainclothes, was confronted by four men coming out of Jamia Masjid allegedly shouting slogans in support of Zakir Musa, a top militant who has called for Islamic rule in Kashmir. 
Khan added that the police initially arrested three suspects and their questioning led to further arrests and the recovery of crucial pieces of evidence such as the iron rod allegedly used to hit Pandith, his pistol - from which he had fired in self-defence after being heckled by the mob - as well as his cell phone that was taken away by the attackers.The three men, who were injured below the waist after Pandith fired in self-defence, have also been arrested as they allegedly were the ones who initially started heckling the police official, Khan said.
