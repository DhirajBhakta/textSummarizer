I never expected this from Lalu's son", said Sanoj Yadav, former RJD leader.According to sources, Sanoj Yadav, despite not being a official spokesperson of RJD was present on a television debate on June 22 where he was to defend Lalu and his family over allegations of corruption being leveled on them. 
Perhaps he was also scared of his son and did not intervene", said the former RJD leader.Soon after the incident, Sanoj Yadav resigned from all the post of the RJD and said that he was also fearing for his life from Tej Pratap Yadav. 
He said that, following the incident, BJP leader Sushil Modi contacted him and asked him to come and meet him at his Junta Durbar today.
