Panama Papers revealed that the Sharif's children owned offshore companies dealing in millions of dollars in property transactions.The case against Sharif stems from documents leaked from the Panama-based Mossack Fonseca law firm, which appeared to show that his daughter and two sons owned offshore holding companies and used them to buy properties in London.The Panama Papers were published last year by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ).
