He claims to have snapped all ties with his political mentor.Reacting to the exit of two party legislators from the UP Upper House, Amar Singh said,"I am not happy at what's happening to the party which I raised with so much hard work and I am also not responding to any calls from Mulayam Singh Yadav since I was ousted twice from the Samajwadi Party and humiliated."
"Samajwadi Party has become a regional party from once a national party for which Mulayam Singh Yadav and I had worked so hard," he adds.He says, "Akhilesh Yadav is Aurangzeb, power has gone into his head and Mulayam Singh Yadav is like Shahjahan."
