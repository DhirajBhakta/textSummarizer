New Delhi, Jul 4 (PTI) Producer Ekta Kapoor has said she came up with a "sassy promo" for "Lipstick Under My Burkha" as she wanted the film to reach out to wider audiences rather than being confined to the art film zone. 
The movie hit a roadblock with the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) soon after Ekta came onboard as a distributor but it only strengthened her desire to take the movie to the masses. 
"I thought, will this be an artie movie that 200 people will watch or a film where Ill get more and more women to see it?
