In what has brought embarrassment to the party, BJP leaders were caught dozing off as former Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi held his weekly Janta Durbar in Patna on Tuesday to hear the grievances of the common man.Former minister Renu Kushwaha and her politician husband Vijay Kumar Singh, who were sitting next to Modi, were caught napping while he addressed mediapersons. 
During the 30-minute press conference, while Modi was busy answering questions, the politician couple remained the centre of attraction as they kept nodding off. 
While Vijay Singh slept blissfully unaware of what was happening around him, Renu was seen battling sleep many times.
