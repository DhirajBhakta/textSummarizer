"The sentence shall be executed and he be taken into custody forthwith," the bench said.The bench also banned the media, both print and electronic, from publishing the contents of further orders passed by Justice Karnan.Justice Karnan had earlier 'sentenced' Chief Justice of India J S Khehar and seven other judges of the Supreme Court to five years rigorous imprisonment.The apex court had on May 1 directed medical check-up of Justice Karnan by doctors with police support, as the judge did not appear before it.
