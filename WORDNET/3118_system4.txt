Bent on proving that cows cannot be tethered to gaushalas of a particular political hue, the chief minister has decided to gift cows to poor farmers in her state.The objective, officials associated with the initiative say, is to help small and marginal farming families supplement their incomes by selling milk and using dung to produce eco-friendly fuel and manure for organic farming. 
And going one better than the National Gokul Mission, where the Centre and state share the cost of the animals given to farmers, Mamata's government will fully fund the state's 'Godaan' scheme. 
A most vocal critic of the Modi government proposal to introduce Aadhaar-like tags for cows, Mamata's government is now working on assigning UIDs (unique identification numbers) to the state's bovine population (this was apparently decided following a cow census in 2014).Paschimbanga go sampad bikash sangstha, a state body under the animal resources development department, has hired 5,174 praanimitras (friends of animals) to tag the cows.
