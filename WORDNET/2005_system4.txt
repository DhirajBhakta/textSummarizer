Set in the Elizabeth towers, the Big Ben, also known as the 'great clock' is scheduled to undergo a much needed annual repairing ritual in 2017, so that the over 157 year-old clock does not stop working completely. 
The Big Ben will go completely silent for a long time as the repairing process goes on.While many weren't affected by this, a young girl named Phoebe was really worried about Radio 4's PM program which starts off only after the Big Ben chimes. 
And that is when Phoebe decided to write a letter to a BBC editor volunteering to say 'BONG' for them until the great clock comes back in action.Jon Hanson, the father of the young girl, shared a Facebook post announcing that Phoebe finally received a reply from BBC.
