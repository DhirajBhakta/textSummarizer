TripAdvisor has honoured 343 beaches, including the top 25 in the world and local lists for Africa, Asia, Australia, Caribbean, Central America, Europe, South America, the South Pacific, the UK and the US Award. 
"I am very excited to see an Indian beach making it to the top 10 in the world, which only goes on to show the spectacular beauty of nature that India has to offer, and how much this is being appreciated by global travellers," TripAdvisor India Country Manager Nikhil Ganju said.
