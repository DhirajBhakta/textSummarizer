oppn (With additional inputs) New Delhi, May 2 (PTI) Union Minister and LJP president Ram Vilas Paswan today took a dig at the opposition parties over their attempts at unity, saying they should not waste their time as there is no vacancy for the prime ministers post till 2024. 
Keeping in view, the continued lack of government jobs, the party also demanded the early implementation of reservation in the private sector, Paswan said. 
His party, he said, is also keen on the passage of the Womens Reservation Bill, which mandates 33 per cent quota for women in Parliament, with separate reservation of SCs, STs and OBCs within it.
