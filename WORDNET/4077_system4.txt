No surprises then that the star who makes his comeback with Bhushan Kumar & Sandeep Singh's Bhoomi wants the release date to be changed.The reason for Sanjay's insistence is that he doesn't want Bhoomi to clash with good friend Aamir Khan's next project Secret Superstar.Sanjay Dutt says, "I know the kind of hard work and effort that goes into making a film. 
I believe, after all the work being put in, it can't be reduced to a clash at the box office. 
Aamir is a dear friend and I wouldn't want my comeback film to be pitted against his. 
In this industry, we should all make an effort to help each other."
