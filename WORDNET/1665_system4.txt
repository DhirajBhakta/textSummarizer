In what could be considered as a controversial comment, former union minister Jairam Ramesh on Monday said north India was more tolerant than south India.Speaking at India Today Conclave-South, Ramesh said, "If I have to choose a place to live, I will choose in north India. 
"I have been living in south India for past 15 years after my retirement. 
He said, "I find the elites of south India are rooted elsewhere - in USA, Germany, Scotland and all such places. 
They have become global citizens but they need to be the citizens of India first," Ramesh said at the India Today Conclave.
