Los Angeles, May 16 (PTI) Chemicals found in Chinese folk medicines may be used to make next generation of molecular condoms that may serve as a safe alternative to todays hormone-based contraceptives, scientists say. 
They work by stopping sperms power kick, which is normally stimulated by the hormone progesterone secreted by cells surrounding the egg and makes the sperms tail whip forcefully to propel it toward and into the egg. 
Human sperm take about five to six hours to mature once they enter the female reproductive system, which is enough time for the drug to enter the system and block the kick.
