New Delhi, Apr 9 (PTI) The UIDAI has blacklisted or suspended around 1,000 operators while FIRs have been filed against 20 individuals in the last three months for malpractices such as charging for Aadhaar enrolment. 
We have identified about 1,000 such operators since December 2016...in the last three months, these operators have been removed from our system and we are also imposing a penalty of Rs 10,000 each on them," UIDAI CEO Ajay Bhushan Pandey told PTI. 
The authority swung into action after it received certain complaints about some of these operators charging money for enrolments -- a service that is free of charge.
