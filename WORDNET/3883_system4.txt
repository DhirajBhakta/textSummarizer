Gossipmongers had a field day last week when reports of Farhan Akhtar and Aditya Roy Kapoor having a nasty spat over the latter's closeness with Shraddha Kapoor started doing the rounds. 
Both went blue in the face denying that they were ever in a relationship, but to no avail. 
Even though Shraddha has maintained that there is nothing brewing between her and Farhan, the rumours of her alleged affair have refused to die down.When she was clicked outside Farhan's house on Tuesday evening, it was being speculated that she went to diffuse the situation and put an end to Farhan's fight with Aditya.
