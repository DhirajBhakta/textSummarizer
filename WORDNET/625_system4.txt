After sitting on the case for almost seven years, the Chennai Police recommended a CBI probe and transfer of case to Mumbai Police on grounds of, "territorial jurisdiction to Mumbai Police is legally sound and justified for effective and speedy investigation".But according to latest reports, Mumbai Police has returned the case to Chennai Police saying that the 'FIR was filed in Chennai'. 
The Central Crime Branch (CCB), Chennai had also agreed to it.In a confidential letter, accessed by Indiatoday.in, the Chennai Police Commissioner opined that "Tamil Nadu (TN) Police have no territorial jurisdiction to investigate the case, therefore, the case is to be transferred from CCD department, Chennai to Mumbai Police, without any further delay".Surprisingly, the state government, after careful examination accepted the proposal and accordingly, directed the Director General of Police to transfer the case to Mumbai for further investigation.
