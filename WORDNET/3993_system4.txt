The problem is that the trailer gave it all away, which, by default, makes the first half of Naam Shabana a drag.Shabana (Taapsee) is a reserved second year B.Com student whose life revolves around Kudo training and her widowed mother. 
But their yet-to-bloom romance is cut short when, on their way home, they get pursued by eve-teasers and a tragedy follows.From this point, the making of Shabana, the lethal spy, starts. 
(Note that the baddie has already eliminated five seasoned agents who went to apprehend him.)It is perhaps to the director Shivam Nair's credit that in spite of the loopholes, Naam Shabana gives us some enjoyable moments.
