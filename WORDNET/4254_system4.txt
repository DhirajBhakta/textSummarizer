After Ram Gopal Varma took on Tiger Shroff and urged women to pleasure men the way Sunny Leone does, bindaas Bhidu Jackie Shroff spoke his mind on the endless controversies his Sarkar 3 (and Rangeela) director RGV has recently drowned himself in.It all began when RGV in a tweet advised Tiger Shroff to not being a 'bikini babe' and instead learn some 'machoism' from his dad Jackie.This happened on March 2, the day Tiger celebrated his birthday. 
When criticised for his tweets, Ramu said that his tweets were meant to be appreciative of Jackie and that his wife (and Tiger's mom) Ayesha shouldn't be taking his tweets to heart.Recently, at an event, when Jackie Shroff was asked to comment on Ramu's rather harsh words about his son, the veteran actor said, "He spoke about my son but that doesn't mean I will go and fight with him."
