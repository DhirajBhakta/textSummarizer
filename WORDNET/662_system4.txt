Molt strutted across the penguin enclosure, swam, ate his birthday cake and frolicked with the other six Humboldts.Mr Molt takes a break from the group and chills in the pool.
Molt got his name because he was molting (shedding his skin, which regenerates on its own every year) when he was brought to the zoo. 
City-based activists, however, were irked when they got to know Mr Molt was made to wear a t-shirt. ?
Zoo authorities said the penguin was made to wear the shirt for just a few seconds. ?
Bubble and Mr Molt drag all the other penguins into the pool, the younger ones get bored and chase the whole family out.
