Danish Agriculture and Food Council announced the relaunch of a bizarre recycling project taking help from music festivals.This year, people taking leaks at the music festival called Roskilde, will be helping out by providing a key ingredient for the production of liquid gold pilsner (lager beer originally brewed in Czech Republic).The plan is to collect urine from special urinals and storage tanks, which will be used to fertilize malting barley, which may further create pisstory.For now, the lager is called 'pilsner' but the Danish Agriculture and Food Council has posed other suggestions like 'Yellow ale' and 'Pale piss' on its official Twitter page.
