The High Court pulled up the top official of Maxx Mobilink Pvt Ltd after taking note of the plea of former captain that its orders have been defied by the firm. 
The court had also passed a similar order on April 21 last year asking Agarwal to inform about the steps taken to comply with the 2014 direction asking the firm to refrain from selling any product, claiming to be endorsed by Dhoni. 
Earlier, the court had asked Maxx to give details of the steps taken by it to remove Dhonis name and photograph from its social media sites including its website and Facebook.
