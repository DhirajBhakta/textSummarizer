Akal Takht head Gurbachan Singh issued an edict to 39 representatives of various political parties holding them tankhaiya (guilty of religious misconduct) asking them to perform sewa (service) in the Sikh shrines. 
He said the head of the sect was held guilty by Akal Takht for various blasphemous acts which had hurt the sentiments of the Sikh community by and large across the globe. 
Members (particularly Sikhs) of various political parties including Congress, SAD and AAP who were asked to appear before the Akal Takht, since being a Sikh no one could visit sect headquarter especially when the community was asked by it to boycott the tainted sect, Singh said.
