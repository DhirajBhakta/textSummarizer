One of the biggest box-office clashes of 2017 got averted when Rajkumar Hirani decided to postpone the release of Sanjay Dutt biopic. 
Sanjay Dutt biopic will now hit the screens in 2018, while Tiger Zinda Hai will release this Christmas. 
Trade Analyst Taran Adarsh took to Twitter to confirm the news and revealed that the Dutt biopic will now release on March 30, 2018.
It seems Hirani did not want to release Sanjay Dutt biopic along with another big-budget film. 
We have to release it at a time when it can garner maximum eyeballs. 
We know Salman has a huge fan following, so it only made business sense to avoid the on-screen clash."
