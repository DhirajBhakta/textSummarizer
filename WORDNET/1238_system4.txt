The Varanasi administration has declined - for a second time - their permission to allow Rahul Gandhi and Akhilesh Yadav to hold a joint roadshow in the run-up to the crucial Uttar Pradesh election.The Congress is citing "inconvenience to people" as its reason to cancel the rally since the day coincides with Ravidas Jayanti, an annual festival in which a large number of people turn up in Varanasi. 
Apparently, the ruling Samajwadi Party is trying to put its best foot forward in western UP, which is why Akhikesh rallies were planned earlier this week.Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav have held two roadshows so far in Lucknow and Agra.
