Reminiscing his 'Perfect Ten' against Pakistan on this very day 18 years ago, leg-spin legend and current India coach Anil Kumble on Tuesday said nobody gave him a chance to pick all the 10 wickets in an innings and he felt privileged to achieve the "rare" cricketing feat.Back on February 7, 1999, Kumble returned epoch-making figures of 10/74 in 26.3 overs to hand India a remarkable 212-run victory over arch-rivals Pakistan at the Ferozeshah Kotla ground in Delhi.Ahead of India's one-off Test against Bangladesh, the 46-year-old, who emulated English off-spinner Jim Laker by picking all 10 wickets, termed such milestones as "unique".
