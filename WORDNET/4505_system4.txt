If some unscrupulous elements in the prosthetic industry have their way, voter fraud could soon go out of hand, literally.A discreet investigation by India Today has unearthed a ring of prosthetic suppliers who, by their own admission on camera, are selling silicone fingers to political parties trying to rig UP elections.Demands for their wares have shot up, they revealed, with leaders ordering them in bulk for their teams to cast multiple votes by masking their fingers bearing the indelible ink-mark with prostheses.Regarded as a badge of democratic privilege, the finger dye prevents voters from re-voting. 
"The hospital has no involvement in whatever claims he has made," Vimhans spokesman Pramod Tripathi told India Today.No one was available for comment at Born Life when India Today reached its office for the company's reaction.Ideal Artificial Limb Solution's Anupriya Chauhan said she was not authorized to speak on-the-record about India Today's probe.The global prosthetic industry has advanced phenomenally over the past 70 years.From wooden limbs, for example, to body-powered, bionic feel-like-real artificial parts, prostheses have come a long way.According to industry experts, amputees have now a wide variety to choose from and customize their prosthetics.
