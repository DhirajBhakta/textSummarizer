WILL DO WHAT KARUNA SAYS: STALIN"Our leader is someone who gives rest to retirement but unfortunately he needs rest now and as a working president I shall stand by his views and do what he says," Stalin said after taking charge.Stalin clarified that his post as a working president is not a post but a responsibility.As the meet got over, Stalin left for Gopalapuram to meet his father and DMK chief Karunanidhi to seek his blessings. 
It was believed that anytime a question on handing over authority to a successor was put forward to Karunanidhi, the Dravidian stalwart would only give an indirect reply keeping the leadership in uncertainty as he knew that it was the only thing that kept his family together at peace.But as his health deteriorated recently and with the death of former CM and AIADMK chief Jayalalithaa, Stalin's supporters raised flags within the party to make him the next leader.Party insiders were a bit appalled to know that the Stalin camp, demanded absolute power before becoming a working president.
