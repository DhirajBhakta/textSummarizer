Mumbai, Apr 24 (PTI) Telecos will continue to face difficulties in fiscal 2018 as well and two of the top three telcos are set to "bleed" due to intense competition triggered after the launch of Reliance Jio, a report said today. 
The report said two of the top three telcos will end last fiscal year with net losses, and this trend is expected to continue in the current fiscal year as well. 
"A 60 per cent fall in 4G data prices since launch of Jio has resulted in muted 2 per cent growth in adjusted gross revenue last fiscal year," the report said.
