By Juhi Chakraborty New Delhi, Jul 24 (PTI) Aadar Jains entry in Bollywood comes at a time when the nepotism debate has gained momentum but the newcomer says he would like people to not judge him before seeing his work. 
"When you work so hard, give it all, an entire year of blood, sweat and hard work and then you read about these comments, you feel bad. 
Yes, I feel bad when people says things without seeing my work. 
The youngster says someone belonging to a film family does get an easy opportunity to meet a director or a casting director but it does not guarantee a movie as an actor can only go forward on the basis of merit.
