Panaji, Feb 8 (PTI) The Goa unit of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has claimed that the Election Commission has failed to curb the use of money power in last weeks Assembly polls in the state. 
At an internal review meeting yesterday, AAPs chief ministerial candidate in the coastal state Elvis Gomes expressed confidence that the people had overwhelmingly voted for the party, party sources said. 
However, he slammed the EC, they added.
