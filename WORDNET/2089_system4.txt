At present, the civic agency has only one staff for catching and relocating hundreds of monkeys roaming in 104 wards. 
Due to manpower shortage, it could catch only 15 monkeys in the last one year, said an SDMC official. 
So far, SDMC pays Rs1,200 for catching and relocation of one monkey.?
SDMC will soon file an affidavit in the Delhi high court, asking that the responsibility of catching and relocating monkeys be shifted to the Delhi government?
Besides, the animal lovers also add to the problem by filing police complaints against corporations and monkey catchers when the simians are caught in ones and twos, not troops.?
