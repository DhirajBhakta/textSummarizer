Avantika Shetty, who was roped in to play the female lead in the upcoming film Raju Kannada Medium, has accused producer K Suresh of 'objectifying' her.? Taking to Twitter, Avantika wrote, "The problem started from the very first day of the schedule of the film when I sensed that it wasn't my performance the producer and the director really bothered about." 
The next thing I know, I was unceremoniously asked to leave back to Mumbai citing my average performance in the film as the reason, which surprisingly came up after I asked them about a bounced cheque, (sic)" she wrote.The actor, who is best known for her role in Rangitaranga, has now approached the Karnataka court for a settlement.
