I would love to thank Akshay Kumar for standing with me and showing tremendous grace in giving me the title Namastey Canada. 
I am very happy that Arjun and Parineeti have agreed to join me in this journey and I hope that this film can become one of their best outings,? 
Namastey Canada has all the heart & humour of a fun family entertainer and I?
Arjun and I are so excited to get this party on the floor. 
Also, I am so excited to be directed by Vipul sir, with whom, I share an amazing friendship in the last few years.?
