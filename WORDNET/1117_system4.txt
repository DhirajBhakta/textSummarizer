Petitioner Ashutosh Bansal had demanded the charge sheet and Godses statement, among other details, from Delhi Police which forwarded the application to the National Archives of India (NAI), saying the records have been handed over to it. 
He said since the information is more than 20-years-old, it cannot be withheld unless it attracts section 8(1)(a) of the RTI Act which prohibits disclosure of information that prejudicially affects security of the State or relations with foreign countries. 
Acharyulu said in the present case, even section 8(1)(a) does not apply as the argument that disclosure of Godses statement could lead to enmity between Hindu and Muslim communities would not apply.
