A 105-year-old man has made history by cycling more than 14 miles round a track in an hour.Robert Marchand set the first hour record in the over-100s category in 2012, then beat it himself two years later at the age of 102, when he covered more than 16 miles. 
He worked as a firefighter in later life, before going to live in Venezuela and Canada.Back in France in the 1960s, Marchand made a living through various jobs that left him with no time to practise sports. 
He was 68 when he began a series of cycling feats.While Marchand is not making plans for the future, his coach, Gerard Mistler, said he would not be surprised to see him continue cycling. ?
