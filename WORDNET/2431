During her recent interview with HTBrunch, Pooja Bhatt revealed that after making sensitive movies like Zakhm and Tamanna, she ventured into adult content with Jism because those kind of movies have a mass appeal.?The age that Alia is today, I had made a film on female infanticide. Then I made Zakhm, again a sensitive movie based on my father?One that you make to jolt the audience and the other is the kind you make to soothe the jolted. I am a commercial filmmaker and I make no bones about that. I am not interested in making movies that only 10 people will watch and will get critical appreciation at some festival.?
