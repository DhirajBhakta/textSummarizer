Jaipur, Feb 24 (PTI) The site of an indefinite hunger strike for Special Backward Class quota turned into the marriage venue for 26-year-old Devraj Gujjar, who tied the nuptial knot here, as he chose not to leave the protest. Gujjar is one of the 10 men who are protesting since February 16 the scrapping of quota to Special Backward Classes in Rajasthan by the high court in December last year. But after the high court struck down the SBC quota, they, like several others, did not get appointment letters. Gujjar said his marriage was fixed eight months ago and because he did not want to delay it, he decided to marry Mamta at the protest site. He said his family members made all arrangements for the wedding.
