Arjuna Ranatunga says India vs Sri Lanka World Cup final was fixed, wants probeThere was no end to controversy surrounding India cricket head coach appointment as even after Ravi Shastri was picked by CAC, there was drama surrounding the appointment of support staff.Fresh controversy started when reports emerged yesterday that Shastri was unhappy with the appointment of Zaheer as bowling coach as he wanted to bring his trusted man Bharat Arun for the job.Reports in some quarters claimed the Committee of Administrators (CoA) felt that the CAC, comprising Ganguly, Sachin Tendulkar and VVS Laxman went out of their ambit in picking the coach.Hurt by these criticism and reports, the CAC wrote a letter to the CoA chairman Vinod Rai and said the appointments were made after informing the new coach Shastri and India captain Virat Kohli.
