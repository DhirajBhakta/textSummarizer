Santiago added.An Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao has been in place in parts of the south since after a rival faction, the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF), signed peace with Manila in 1996.However it had failed to end violence and rebellion.Santiago said both the MILF and MNLF helped to draft the new self-rule bill giving all sides optimism about its passage. 
Duterte is also set to decide within the week whether to extend military rule over Mindanao.The constitution limits martial rule to 60 days, a safeguard against abuses put in place after the downfall of the Ferdinand Marcos dictatorship.However Congress can authorise an extension.The military said there were still 60-80 gunmen holed up in about 500 Marawi houses and buildings after weeks of day and night air strikes and artillery pounding.About 300 civilians also remain trapped in the area and some of them have been taken hostage, the military said.
