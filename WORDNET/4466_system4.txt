New Delhi, Feb 26 (PTI) Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar will address two rallies in the national capital ahead of the municipal polls, where JD(U) will contest all the 272 seats, taking on the AAP on its home turf. 
BJPs decision to appoint Bhojpuri artiste Manoj Tiwari as its Delhi unit chief is also being seen as an attempt to woo the Poorvanchali community, comprising the people from the eastern part of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. 
Jha brushed aside Kumars perceived closeness with Kejriwal, saying JD(U) will work for expanding its base and work towards ensuring "fair" representation of the Poorvanchali population.
