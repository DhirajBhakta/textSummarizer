 Health services were crippled at the district hospital in Sector 30 for four hours on Monday as contractual doctors and paramedical staff went on a strike and protested against the hospital administration for not paying them salaries for the last three months. 
Nearly 150 doctors and nurses of the hospital took part in the four-hour protest from 8am to 12pm at the district hospital premises. 
They have worked here for three months and they resumed their work today (Monday) too after the protest. 
The staff strength of 350 is enough to take care of patients in a facility the size of the district hospital.
