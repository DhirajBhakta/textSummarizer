s villages asking other farmers not to give their land for the proposed airport project.Their opposition may impact the airport project for which the state government needs 5,000 hectares in around 40 villages along the Yamuna Expressway. 
We will not let the land acquisition take place for the airport project because the state government is cheating farmers by giving them only Rs3,500 per square metre (psm) for land. 
We are likely to start a campaign telling all villagers along the expressway not to give their land for the project until the UP government gives better compensation,? 
We will educate farmers who give up land for the airport project and start a big protest soon as all farmer unions are together on this issue,?
