The move comes after the Supreme Court last year ruled that the chairman, managing directors and other officers of a private bank could be seen as public servants when it came to the Prevention of Corruption (PC) Act, 1988. 
"The CVC can now also look into cases of corruption involving private sector banks and their managements like CMDs and MDs," Bhasin said. 
"The necessary mechanism has been put in place and cases of corruption in the private sector banks are now being looked into," Bhasin said. 
The apex court had said all officials working in banks operating under an RBI licence would be defined as public servants under the PC Act.
