London, Apr 24 (PTI) Oxford University students who avoid making eye contact with their peers could be guilty of racism, according to the prestigious varsitys latest guidance. 
However, some critics slammed the newsletter, saying it would make the students over sensitive. 
Dr Joanna Williams, a lecturer in higher education at the University of Kent, said the guidance was "completely ridiculous" and will make students "hyper-sensitive" about how they interact with one another. 
An Oxford University spokesman was quoted as saying that, "The Equality and Diversity Unit works with University bodies to ensure that the Universitys pursuit of excellence goes hand in hand with freedom from discrimination and equality of opportunity."
