Some colleges have been allowed to double or even triple the current fees, while in some cases the fees has been reduced.Till now, the fees at law colleges in the state was being regulated by their respective universities. 
In October 2015, HT had reported that the university had directed a law college in Goregaon to refund excess fee charged from students.The regulator has now fixed the fees of academic year 2016-17, which will be applicable retroactively, as well as fees for 2017-18, which will be applicable for the upcoming academic year. 
said Jyoti Deshmukh, principal, VES College of Law, Chembur.The students, however, feel that the colleges need to upgrade their infrastructure and quality of education in order to justify the hike. ?
