Colombo, Mar 26 (PTI) India will become the worlds youngest country by 2020 with an average age of 29, Indias envoy in Sri Lanka said today. Sixty-four per cent of Indias population will be in the working age group by 2020, High Commissioner of India to Sri Lanka Taranjith Singh Sandhu said while delivering a foreign policy lecture here. "With western Europe, the US, South Korea, Japan and even China aging, this demographic potential offers India an unprecedented edge which could further contribute to the GDP growth rate," he said. "The core aim of Indias foreign policy is to meet the developmental aspirations of its 1.25 billion people. Our diplomacy is for our development," the envoy said.
