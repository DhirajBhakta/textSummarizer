Given a chance, I will go back again on Amarnath Yatra,? s Anantnag that left seven Amarnath pilgrims dead.Hailed as a hero for having driven through the hail of bullets until the bus reached a military camp, the government of Jammu and Kashmir has announced a cash award of Rs 3 lakh for Saleem. He kept his nerve and continued driving for another 1.5 km.Saleem, however, gives much of the credit to Harsh Desai, the bus owner?Java do, Java do (keep moving, keep moving),? But Harsh took three bullets and is now under treatment.Engaged as a driver by the tour operator at a daily wage of Rs 1,000 for the 23-day trip, it was the fourth time he had gone for the Amarnath Yatra ferrying Gujrati pilgrims.It turned out to be the most harrowing trip till date.?
