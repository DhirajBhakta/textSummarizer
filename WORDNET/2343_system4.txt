By Lalit K Jha ?????????????? Washington, Jul 15 (PTI) Rising sectarian attacks in India might help drive support to al-Qaeda, a top US expert has told lawmakers, noting that the terror group is trying to reassert itself in the Indian subcontinent. 
"Rising sectarian attacks in India might help drive support to al-Qaida," Katherine Zimmerman, research fellow, American Enterprise Institute, a top American think-tank, told members of the House Homeland Security Subcommittee on Counterterrorism and Intelligence during a Congressional hearing on al-Qaida threat. 
"I think theres no question its a concern if you look at the increasing levels of violence that have been perpetrated by groups associated with al-Qaida in the Indian subcontinent, as well as ISIS in Bangladesh," said Seth Jones from the Rand Foundation in response to another question.
