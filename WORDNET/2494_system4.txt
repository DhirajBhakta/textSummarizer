s look-alikes time after time.One such look-alike was spotted waiting for a train at a railway station recently and, of course, the photo went viral on social media sites in no time.Comedy group All India Bakchod (AIB) was among the many Twitteratis who jumped onto the bandwagon to spread some humour. 
Startup of Cards (@BhargavPurohit) July 13, 2017Always thought that @AllIndiaBakchod had extra balls when they made jokes on MMS,RG & Cong during UPA. 
Now AIB should just stick to making anti-Congress sketches which they did with much pride during our regime, ab woh FOE yaad nahi!? 
CoffeeStains (@umesh110168) July 13, 2017This did not go down well with AIB co-founders Tanmay Bhat and Rohan Joshi who hit back at the trolls in equal measure. 
Tanmay Bhat (@thetanmay) July 13, 2017In the end Tanmay Bhatt had had enough with the roasting.PS: Will continue making jokes. 
And making jokes again.
