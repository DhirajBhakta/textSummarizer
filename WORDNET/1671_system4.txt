Am a proud Tamilian, this is our culture," he said.NOT THE FIRST TIMEOn earlier occasions too, Haasan was vocal about restarting the 'tradition' and has said jallikattu must not be confused with bull-fighting in Spain.The 62-year-old actor had said that in Spain, people hurt the animal and it would die, but in Tamil Nadu bulls are treated like "god, as part of the family".Haasan said the sport of jallikattu is all about bull-taming and not about harming the animal involved. 
"It is about taming the bull and not creating physical harm by breaking its horns or other parts," he had said.In a blow to the Tamil Nadu government in November last year, the Supreme Court had dismissed the state's plea seeking recall of its 2014 verdict banning the bull fights, holding that the practice amounted to cruelty to the animals.
