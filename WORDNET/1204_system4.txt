"As I was walking about 5 to 6 feet away from the water I heard a splash, and as soon as I heard that splash I knew it was an alligator, and he got me," Aarts was quoted as saying by WINK News. 
"I remember having a club in my hand, and as soon as he had me in the water up to my waist, I started hitting him over the head," Aarts said. 
And Im thinking Im getting deeper and deeper, and I thought youre not gonna get me," he was quoted as saying. 
I hit him three times and he let go of my foot, so I crawled back out and by that time the guys were there," he said.
