According to a report by The Dawn, the two bar associations in a joint declaration said that following the Supreme Court's order on the Panama Papers case, the Prime Minister should no longer hold the position and resign within seven days.This comes after the Supreme Court Bar Association and the Lahore High Court Bar Association members clashed with the lawyers supporting the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML_N) government. Both bar associations are of the view that in light of the Supreme Court's ruling on the Panama Papers case (that questioned the moral authority of the premier to rule), PM Nawaz Sharif should no longer hold his office and should therefore resign," a joint statement issued by the both bar associations said after their convention in Lahore.It said the judgement in the Panama case has clearly indicted Sharif and his children for financial improprieties and corruption and a joint investigation team has been formed to probe him."
