Former Australian middle-order stalwart Michael Hussey has urged Steven Smith's men to not try and rile India captain Virat Kohli in the four-Test series which starts this month. 
But that backfired on the hosts as Kohli went on to slam his then Test best of 169 in the Boxing Day match.Kohli seems to enjoy these battles and not many teams around the world want to rub the run-machine the wrong way. 
England, who were recently handed a 4-0 drubbing in the Test series late last year, stayed quiet. 
Apart from one episode that involved a spat with Ben Stokes and another press conference in poor taste from James Anderson, the series was largely played in good spirits.
