A division bench of Justice V M Kanade and Justice A M Badar were hearing a petition moved by the Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation, which is in charge of constructing the rail link between Colaba and SEEPZ in Andheri, and told those opposing that "there was a need for Metro. "The Metro III project will prove very useful for these people so everyone should first consider the ground situation," Justice Kanade said.The corporation needs to cut 108 trees to construct two stations including the Bandra Kurla Complex station. A lawyer for the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation told the court they had "taken loans from Japan for the contruction of Metro rail and each delay over tree cutting was causing huge losses".
