Reports earlier emerged that the Mumbai event, scheduled for January had been cancelled after authorities failed to give the go-ahead for the show. 
Guetta is set to perform tonight in Hyderabad following which he will perform two shows on Sunday - the rescheduled Mumbai concert, which will take place in the morning, and another one in Delhi, which will be held as per schedule, beginning at 4pm. 
Reports of Guetta's Mumbai concert getting cancelled came right on the heels of the artist's Bengaluru show being scrapped. 
Bengaluru police fired back saying permission for the event had never been issued, adding that the organizers approached them for permission just two days before the concert date.
