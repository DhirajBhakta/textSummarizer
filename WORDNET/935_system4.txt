The judges at the Yeovil show had crowned the two hefty blocks of cheese champion and reserve champion and the specimens were being left in a marquee overnight so that they could be admired by members of the public next day.

It took around a year-and-a-half to make those cheeses. 
Clothier said that while the retail value was put at ?800 it is possible that they could be worth much more if the right wealthy cheese-loving customers were found.
