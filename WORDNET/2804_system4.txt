If senders have turned on a notification setting in WhatsApp on their phone, they are told that the key has changed, but not otherwise.Critics said that the Guardian article overstated the risk of what is known in the jargon as a man-in-the-middle attack, in which a third party could exploit the combination of offline phone, messages in transit and changed key to intercept private communications.The intensity of the external criticism seems to have stemmed partly from frustration that the article was in the Guardian, with its deserved reputation for using and reporting on technology in ways that help bridge the gap between non-experts and specialists.Some were concerned that an overstated claim in the Guardian about risk to the security of WhatsApp would cause non-expert users to become unduly worried and needlessly abandon WhatsApp for less secure communication methods.The critics had two different groups of WhatsApp users in mind.First, the vast majority of users, for whom WhatsApp security is fine and who would probably experience worse communications security if they stopped using it.Second, a much smaller group, activists in authoritarian regimes, whose threat model means they need high security and for whom the popularity of WhatsApp means they can ?
