Pakistani actor Sajal Aly, who played a rape survivor in her Bollywood debut Mom, says she had never dreamed of acting in the Indian film industry. 
I mean any character you play, you have to really commit to it and kind of naturally become like that, at least that?
I was happy working here and that was not something I was working towards but this story moved me.  
I always knew that if I worked in Bollywood, I have certain limitations and boundaries that I would not want to cross and this movie was about a sensitive topic, everything was handled so tastefully.?
