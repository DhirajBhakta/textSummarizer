Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis on Friday told Rajat Nath, the husband of former Doordarshan anchor Kanchan who was killed last week after a tree fell on her in Chembur, that action has been initiated against the garden department of the Mumbai civic body.Fadnavis said he will look into the matter to ensure compensation for the family. 
Kanchan, a former television news reader with Doordarshan, was on her way home from her yoga classes last Thursday when the tree fell on her, injuring her neck, at Kurla Road near Swastik Park at Chembur East. 
Experts have blamed the haphazard way in which authorities pruned trees and the concretisation around the roots, which make the trees weak, as the main causes of these falls.
