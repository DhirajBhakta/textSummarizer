Following is the full text:Open Letter by Retired Officials on the Growing Religious IntoleranceSaturday 24 June 2017The following is an open letter of sixtyfive retired officials released on June 12, 2017.We are a group of retired officers of All India and Central services of different batches, who have worked with the Central and State governments in the course of our careers. 
While we agree that genuine violators should be identified and penalised, we note with dismay that several of the targeted groups are those who have taken stands against government policies, expressed dissent or supported communities in cases against the state.We are also seeing an ugly trend of trolling, threats and online intimidation of activists, journalists, writers and intellectuals who disagree with the dominant ideology. 
Those in authority should not be questioned- that is the clear message.In the face of a rising authoritarianism and majoritarianism, which do not allow for reasoned debate, discussion and dissent, we appeal to all public authorities, public institutions and constitutional bodies to take heed of these disturbing trends and take corrective action.
