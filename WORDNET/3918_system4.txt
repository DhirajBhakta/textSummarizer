Mumbai, Apr 6 (PTI) Asha Parekhs versatility helped her feature in films of diverse genres in the 1960s but the veteran actress says being on top is often lonesome and there was a phase where she went into depression. 
Then I got out of it. 
It is a struggle, I had to take aid of the doctors to get out of it," Parekh told PTI in an interview. 
So after losing her, I got into depression. 
Parekh started her career as a child artist in the 1952 "Aasmaan" and went on to act in Bimal Roys "Baap Beti" two years later.
