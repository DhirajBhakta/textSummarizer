She plays the leading lady in the film. 
Why would you take an Indian actor, especially an actor of Deepika's stature and make her play a Chinese character?" 
the Ek Tha Tiger director added.In the interview, the director also talked about another upcoming film which was rejected by Salman Khan because he felt suffocated by the prosthetics that his character required.Tubelight, which will also see Shah Rukh Khan in a cameo, is the story of two brothers set against the backdrop of the 1962 Sino-Indian war.
