A source was quoted as telling Mumbai Mirror a few days ago, "Richa recently moved to Versova (Mumbai) and Angad worked alongside the packers to smoothen out the process of settling into a new home for her. 
Angad and Richa will be seen together in upcoming web series Inside Edge, which will have cricket as its backdrop.Asked about their sports interests, Angad, son of former cricketer Bishan Singh Bedi, said, "I have a sports background, so obviously I have followed sports from childhood. 
I have been following the India-West Indies cricket tour and now also Wimbledon has started, I have been following that as well."
