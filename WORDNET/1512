Sources in the BJP said Shekhar has joined the party ahead of the Uttarakhand Assembly election, while Tiwari has only extended his support to the party.Earlier today, Tiwari went to BJP president Amit Shah's residence in New Delhi along with his son Rohit and wife Ujjwala, dealing a major blow to a party he served for over five decades ahead of the February 15 election.Tiwari, 91, was Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister for three terms and was the third Chief Minister of Uttarakhand from 2002 to 2007. He also served as a minister at the Centre several times having held charge of key portfolios like Finance and External Affairs.Tiwari was also the Governor of Andhra Pradesh from 2007 to 2009, a post he quit after being embroiled in a sex tape controversy.Tiwari's family today expressed disappointment and shock over reports of his joining the BJP and alleged the decision was being "made for him".
