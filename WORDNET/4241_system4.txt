According to reports, 40-50 unidentified men tried to vandalise the sets and set it on fire. 
Bhansali shifted venue for security reasons, but it's sad to see that the set was attacked here too. 
The reason for the attack was that Bhansali was allegedly showing a romantic sequence between 14th century emperor Alauddin Khilji (played by Ranveer Singh) and Rani Padmini (played by Deepika Padukone), an incident which the Karni Sena claims had never happened in history and thus, filming the same would be an insult to the Rajputana pride.Interestingly, the filmmakers had never planned to have such a scene in the first place.
