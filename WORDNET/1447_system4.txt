I guess once you make peace with that you just see what happens. 
I was going to play him as a handicapped person who is projecting a certain kind of neediness or helplessness so that he creates empathy and sympathy for him. 
I just scrapped it and played it exactly as who I am without any weight given to the fact that he is blind.
If there were more films that I wanted to do, then I would have done them. 
Perhaps, I am looking for something that is a little rarer or I want to use my films to express my own self through my interpretations of my experiences.
