She took her fans by surprise when she made her debut on Facebook, and later added another address - Instagram. 
From film sets to her hot photoshoots to her mood swings, Katrina is giving a sneak-peek into her life, and we are not complaining. 
She said, "I don't know why I was so against joining the social media. 
But now that I have come on it, I really like it. 
"I really wish I had because I would have done much more. 
I have things to say, and then there are these abstract pictures and thoughts in my head. 
It makes me feel not so alone," said Katrina.
