The Central Pollution Control Board is planning to develop a Delhi-specific driving cycle and location-specific air quality management plans with the money which manufacturers and dealers have deposited with it over the past one year as Environment Protection Charge,? 
Even though several countries in the US and Europe have already developed such city specific driving cycles to tackle air pollution, India is yet to come up with a driving cycle. ?
If we get to know the driving cycle of Delhi it would help us to bring down the pollution levels by doing away with those elements on the roads which cause pollution,?
