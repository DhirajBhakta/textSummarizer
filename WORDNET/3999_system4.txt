Argentina star striker Lionel Messi has asserted his innocence after being hit with a four-match international ban for verbally abusing an official, saying that he was yelling `to the air`.The action has been taken by FIFA's disciplinary panel against Messi for his insults aimed at - and comments about the mother of - Brazilian assistant referee Dewson Silva during Argentina's 1-0 win over Chile last week.The Barcelona forward was caught on video invoking "the c*** of [Silva's] mother" as he appeared livid against an officiating decision. 
My sayings were never addressed to the assistant, but they were said to the air," goal.com quoted Messi as saying.Earlier, Argentina had announced their intention to appeal the ban, which would also see Messi miss three more of remaining four World Cup qualifying matches against Uruguay, Venezuela and Peru if unchanged.
