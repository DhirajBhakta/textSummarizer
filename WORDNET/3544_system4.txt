Lauding the NDA government for coordinated efforts of the Prime Ministers Office with various ministries and departments on the Housing for All by 2022 mission, Parekh said this has been one of the main promises made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and several steps have been taken, especially this year, to achieve this goal. 
Talking about other steps that would give a big fillip to the sector, he said the housing loan interest subsidy scheme is a game changer that gives subsidy of up to 6.5 per cent. 
On other good provisions, Parekh said when a builder earlier had unsold flats in a completed project, the notional rent was taxed on these unsold flats from the year in which the project was completed.
