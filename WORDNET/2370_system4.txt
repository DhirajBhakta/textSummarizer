Haasan was addressing the media regarding a complaint raised by a fringe Hindu Group over the ongoing Tamil reality TV show, Bigg Boss, which he hosts.Kumaramangalam said the actor?
It is very arrogant to say that somebody else has said it so I will say it too,? 
, said Kumaramangalam.To name minor victims and victims of sexual assault or printing or using their name which makes their identity known is prohibited by the law.  
When someone like him who has billions of fans says something like this, it sets a bad precedent,? 
said Kumaramangalam.The NCW chief also said all that the actor had to do was apologise.?
t make him small to say that ?
