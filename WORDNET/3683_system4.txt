When Sushant was clicked taking Kriti for a spin in his new swanky car, rumour mills went into an overdrive. 
It's not like I bought the car and took Kriti for a ride," he laughed. 
"I had taken the car out for a spin alone the day it was delivered. 
For the last few weeks, stories of Sushant and Kriti's relationship going kaput were doing the rounds. 
Photos of their long drive made people think they had decided to rekindle their dying out romance. 
Sushant laughed, "I read about this thing between us, then there were stories about a fight and a break-up and then suddenly, probably because of the Maserati we were back together."
