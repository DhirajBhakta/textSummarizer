An Indian officer, Mohan Singh, was appointed the incharge of this troop, but later Subhash Chandra Bose (played by Kenny Basumatary) took control and gave birth to the INA.The actual film begins when trials start and the British regime decides to handle it with an iron fist. 
Bhula Bhai Desai (Kenneth Desai), a lawyer on the verge of retirement, helps Dhulia in getting the perfect narrative tone for the film.Disgusted with the Congress which refused to give him a ticket to contest the general elections, Bhula Bhai puts aside his differences with Nehru to plead the case of three men whose patriotism is dependent on one ruling.However, Bhula Bhai is just a face as many fight in the background.
