By Ashwini Shrivastava New Delhi, May 4 (PTI) The SBI has declined to share the quantum of money lying in suspended bank accounts in which the interest amount of customers, who do not claim it due to religious reasons, is kept. 
Replying to an RTI query, the State Bank of India (SBI) said it does not maintain such information in its database "in normal course of business and extraction of the same will be voluminous and time taking activity". 
The interest money which is not claimed by people due to religious obligations is kept in suspended bank accounts. 
According to an article published in Reserve Bank of Indias journal in 2005, it was reported that in India thousands of crores earned in interest is kept in suspended accounts.
