We know that ovarian tissue transplantation works for older women, but we've never known if we could take tissue from a child, freeze it and make it work again."
Moaza needed chemotherapy, which damages the ovaries, before receiving a bone marrow transplant.So, before her doctors started the treatment, when Moaza was nine years old, she had her right ovary removed in an operation in Leeds, where the tissue was frozen, reports BBC.
