From Prasoon Srivastava Barcelona, Mar 2 (PTI) The governments proposal to auction spectrum every year has got a backer in Bharti Airtel Chairman Sunil Bharti Mittal, who however has said there is no need for sale of airwaves in coming fiscal. 
Mittal recently pitched for affordability in spectrum pricing that has gone "out of control" in the last few years, saying the spectrum surplus industry will not need an airwave auction at least in 2017-18. 
The Indian telecom czar said Bharti Airtels balancesheet remains "healthy and strong" and he does not think Bharti will go into losses under competitive pressure although one can "never say never".
