As has been pointed out, at least they have demonstrated the ability to get runs against international bowling attacks, under the sort of pressure which playing international sport brings. 
Given that England are bound to lose this match before close of play, perhaps now would be a good time to give a shout out to Krakow Cricket Club. 
But I agreed with myself, and agree with this thread too.Eoin Morgan should be playing Test cricket.Maybe 11 ODI centuries is as good an indication of international pedigree as scoring loads of runs against county attacks in April and May.
says Mikey, far more melodically than I can type. root takes a single off the final ball of the over, playing it down into the off side and haring away. ?
