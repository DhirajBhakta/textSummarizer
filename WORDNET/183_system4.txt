Whether it is Airlift, Rustom, Jolly LLB 2 and even Toilet Ek Prem Katha, Akshay is acting in stories that project realism.Asked if that is a strategy, the National Award-winning actor said, "If you are talking about issue-based stories like Toilet Ek prem Katha, I think being a successful actor by the grace of God, if my association gives the film a better mileage and if the story intrigued me, I do it.
