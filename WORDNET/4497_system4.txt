I feel leaders of both parties have to take a decision, showing sujh bujh (understanding) and maturity," Gadkari told a Marathi TV channel.He singled out Sena mouthpiece 'Saamana' for its targeting of PM Narendra Modi and BJP president Amit Shah."
I feel that had these things been avoided, there would not have been so much bitterness between BJP and Sena," Gadkari said.Shiv Sena should take care that relations between the two parties should not deteriorate because of Saamana, he said.Gadkari's remarks came a day after the BJP scored an emphatic win in the Maharashtra civic polls, emerging as the largest party in eight of the 10 municipal corporations, while finishing a close second to Shiv Sena in BMC elections.The BJP improved its 2012 BMC poll performance by leaps and bounds, winning 82 seats, just two less than Sena.
