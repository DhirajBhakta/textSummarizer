At present, the act provides the disability rights and benefits to seven special categories of people comprising blindness, low-vision, locomotive disability, hearing impairment, mental retardation, mental illness and leprosy.The new conditions will apply to people with cerebral palsy, dwarfism, muscular dystrophy, specific learning disabilities, deafness, autism, spectrum disorder, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, haemophilia, thalassemia, sickle cell disease, multiple disabilities (condition of any two disabilities or more) and acidattack survivors.Ministry officials said the previous Right of Persons with Disabilities Act 1995, mentions only seven categories including people having 40 per cent and above disability, providing them all benefits.In 2001, disability assessment guidelines were prepared for these categories, but there was no measure to calculate the percentage of disability in a person.
