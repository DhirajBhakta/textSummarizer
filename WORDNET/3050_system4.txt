He said the extension given to him by the government earlier this month was "adhoc", till further orders, as it was done when the Prime Minister was on a visit to Russia. 
Rohatgi said that he maintained a "good relationship" with the government and would come to its aid as and when required. 
He said he was appointed by the Narendra Modi government after it came to power in May 2014 and he has served his term to his full satisfaction. 
"I will come to the aid of the government as long as I live," he said. 
Asked about his response if Prime Minister Narendra Modi insists that he continue, Rohatgi said, "I will cross the bridge when it comes."
