The former Pakistan wicketkeeper's choice of vocabulary had left much to be desired and his verbal onslaught left observers stunned. 
India had defeated Pakistan in their Champions Trophy opener on June 4 and there was the usual social media banter between supporters of the two teams. 
Sometimes the banter tends to get a little overboard as emotions run high. 
However, Pakistan came back strongly from their dismal start to first storm into the final and then defeating India, the pre-tournament favourites. 
"We lost one match badly in this year's Champions Trophy to India and India lost the final badly to Pakistan...this is a part of cricket and it happens," said Latif in a fresh video after Pakistan's remarkable vicotry.
