Senior Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) ideologue Indresh Kumar on Saturday said that Muslims in India have understood that even Allah doesn't want an 'impure' mosque at the disputed site in Ayodhya.Speaking to India Today, the veteran RSS functionary and convener of its minority cell - Muslim Rashtriya Manch said, "Muslims have realised that since Allah himself has not allowed the mosque to come up there, it's unlikely that it will ever come up."
I would like to appeal to the courts of the land that if someone needs to be tried it should be Babur and his army general Mir Baqi," he added.At a time when the RSS backed Muslim Rashtriya Manch is backing the call for a Ram Mandir at Ayodhya, Kumar said that many in the community have stated that they don't want an 'illegal' mosque, especially one that was built on a disputed land."
