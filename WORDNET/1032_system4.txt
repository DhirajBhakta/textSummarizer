The Delhi government has released Rs100 crore for the Signature Bridge project, which was hit by a fund crunch slowing down its last phase of construction.Delhi tourism minister Rajendra Gautam said, on Monday, that the finance department has sanctioned the amount after examining the contractor?
Gautam, who had inspected the bridge earlier, had written to the chief secretary, saying that the work should not go on beyond December 31, this year, under any circumstances.?
This fresh infusion of funds will ensure that work, which had considerably slowed down, resumes. 
In January, lieutenant governor Anil Baijal had directed the authorities concerned to send to him a monthly progress report of the project.
