"A resident of the district made us aware that a pest control company had been visiting Sands. 
We served a hygiene emergency prohibition order on Sands of Glenfield for a cockroach infestation, on Saturday, February 4," a spokesperson for the local Blaby District Council told ?
"The business is now formally closed as a food business until our environmental health team are satisfied that the health risk condition no longer exists. 
We are working closely with representatives of the business and their pest control company to advise them about the steps they need to take in order for this to be achieved," she added.
