With a month to go for the 10-day Ganeshotsav, a Ganesh mandal coordination committee in the city has asked the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) to take the process to get permission to setup pandals online. 
??As per this policy, the BMC had made it compulsory for all pandals to get approvals from the police, traffic and fire departments. 
?However, BMC officials said they have no plans to move the system online and all the mandals will have to go to ward offices to submit their applications. 
The civic official added that though there are more than 11,000 mandals across the city, only 20% of them seek permission to erect pandals during Ganeshotsav.The nine-page circular of the BMC policy was issued to all 24 administrative wards by civic chief Ajoy Mehta, last year, after the HC order.? It requires organisers to submit a location map with the sketch of the pandal mentioning its length, width and height.
