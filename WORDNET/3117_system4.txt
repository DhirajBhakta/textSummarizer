The story is about a young man from the streets, called Munna, played by Tiger, who is a big fan of Michael Jackson. 
When asked how it was to dance on screen, Nawazuddin told reporters, "Initially I felt I was forced to do it, but I started enjoying dancing while doing the film... 
"I cant be a dancing hero, but if I get a solo hero film Ill definitely do it but it shouldnt have dancing. 
I danced with a lot of difficulty and learnt a lot by observing Tigers dancing steps. 
I think I have tried to reach nearly 5 per cent of his dancing skills."
