One recent occasion was when a woman went into labour at Old Delhi Railway Station at 4.15am; her panicked husband called the police control room. 
To cut a long story short, a PCR van (mobile patrol) arrived, and the woman delivered her baby in the van.?
While taking her to the hospital, her water broke and we had to get the baby delivered in the van itself, near Netaji Subhash Marg,? 
ve briefed our staff not to disturb the cord, giving the mother her privacy and taking the mother and baby to the nearest hospital. 
s husband and our inspectors had to take charge. 
The baby and mother were then taken to the LNJP hospital, Daryaganj, and were declared in good health.
