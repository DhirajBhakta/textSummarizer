New Delhi, Feb 14 (PTI) NHRC has received over 14,600 cases of bonded labour since its inception and this "anathema of civilised humanity" still persists in many sectors, chairperson Justice (retd) H L Dattu today said. 
The Commission has recommended compensation in cases of bonded labour and also amendments to several provisions in Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act, 1976, Dattu said. 
The NHRC chairperson also said it would be wrong to think that bonded labour is a thing of past, as it can be found even today in not only agriculture but also in other sectors of employment including brick kilns, stone quarries, salt fields, lather manufacturing units and so on.
