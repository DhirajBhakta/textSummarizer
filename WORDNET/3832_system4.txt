The three-day World Cultural Festival soon grabbed headlines for allegedly polluting and damaging the Yamuna floodplain ecosystem.The NGT slapped an interim fine Rs 5 crore on the Foundation for environmental damage while efforts were made to ascertain the exact costs of the damage.An initial four-member committee had recommended that the Foundation pay Rs100 to Rs 120 crores as compensation for the restoration work.The green court had later asked an expert panel of seven members to estimate the damage to the floodplains and how much it would cost to fix these damages.
