"There was no off-season with sir as we played with rubber ball during Monsoon. 
In my opinion, sir was a Guru and there is a lot of difference between a Guru and a coach," said Amre, who played 11 Tests for the country. 
Former India stumper and batsman Chandrakant Pandit recalled how "visionary" Achrekar sir made him change his school to pursue a career in cricket. 
Another ex-stumper Sameer Dighe remembered the role played by the veteran trainer in his career. 
But on sirs word for me, he left keeping when I was playing for Mithibai (College)," recalled Dighe, the present Mumbai Ranji coach. 
Pandurang Salgoankar, who had played with Achrekar, narrated some instances, involving the latter as a wicket keeper.
