In a remark likely to court controversy, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat on Wednesday said every person born in India is a Hindu."
Everyone born in the country is a Hindu -- of these some are idol-worshipers and some are not. 
Even Muslims are Hindus by nationality, they are Muslims by faith only," he said in Baitul, Madhya Pradesh. 
Bhagwat, who is in the state on an eight-day visit, went on to say, "Just as the English live in England, Americans in America and Germans in Germany, Hindus live in Hindustan." 
They may have become Muslims by faith but they are Hindus by nationality," he added.
