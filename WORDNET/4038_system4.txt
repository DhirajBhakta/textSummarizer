In an exclusive interview with IndiaToday.in, Taapsee opened up about her relationship.While she did not confirm that Mathias was the man in her life, she said, "I'm in an extremely good state in my personal life. 
Now, why I don't talk about it in the media is not because I'm ashamed to accept it, but because if I do, then everything will be centred around that and people will start talking about that more than the work I do, which I don't want. 
That is the only reason I don't want to talk about it.
