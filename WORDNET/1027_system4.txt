It could easily be mistaken as a CGI photo, given the stunning improbability of capturing a lightning bolt striking an angry, erupting volcano. 
Selected from more than 15,000 entries from participants in more than 30 countries, the photograph by Sergio Tapiro Valesco captures volcanic lightning -- also known as a dirty thunderstorm -- whereby a flash of lightning is produced within the ash cloud spewing from the volcano. 
Glowing, angry lava, plumes of grey smoke and lightning bolts are set against a starlit night sky, producing visual testimony of nature?
What I was watching was impossible to conceive, the image showed those amazing forces of nature interacting on a volcano, while the lightning brightened the whole scene.
