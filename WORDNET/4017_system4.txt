In an interview with Hindustan Times, Alia said, "I do want to settle down early (in life) because I have an advantage of having started off (in career) very early. 
That way, I can get done with it (getting married) and continue (in my career). 
Also, I don't want to settle down too late in life because that also has its own issues." 
Ever since she made her debut with Student Of The Year, Alia's name has been linked with her co-star Sidharth Malhotra's. 
I think I will only get married when I want to have babies." 
We wonder how Sidharth will react to Alia's admission that she wants to get married soon.
