Rajgir (Bihar), May 4 (PTI) RJD chief Lalu Prasad today asked his party workers to tie old, non-milking cows outside the houses of BJP leaders to see if they really cared for the animal. Prasad slammed the Narendra Modi government over a spurt in attacks on security personnel, saying the prime minister, who talked of a 56-inch chest before the 2014 Lok Sabha polls and patted his own back for surgical strikes in PoK, should answer how Pakistani soldiers are entering the Indian territory and beheading our jawans. He accused the BJP and the RSS of making efforts to scrap reservation in government jobs and demanded that quota be introduced for three of the four seats of the Shankaracharyas. The RJD chief also asked his party men to desist from making any comments that could led to strains in the ruling Grand Alliance in Bihar.
