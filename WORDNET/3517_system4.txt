That is the target that Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar has set and work to rehabilitate abandoned cattle is already on in a mission mode. 
At a meeting here, Khattar said the tagging of 89.3 per cent of cattle in gaushalas and nandishalas (shelters for bovine animals) has been completed and Haryana would be made stray cattle-free by August 15, 2017. 
The work to rehabilitate abandoned cattle is being undertaken in a mission mode and 27,000 animals have already been accommodated in gaushalas, he said. 
Unique Identification Numbers are being assigned to each animal during tagging and cow shelter managements and veterinarians are being encouraged to maintain computerised records of these animals, he said.
