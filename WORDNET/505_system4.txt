Over 15,700 flood affected people were evacuated by rescue teams in 21 districts.Flood waters have receded in many areas due to clear skies in the past week, but 9 districts still remained inundated and 4,716 people continue to take shelter in relief camps in five districts.While the state government claims adequate relief was provided to all flood affected, there are accusations of laxity in rescue and relief efforts. 
Ministers of the Bharatiya Janata Party-led coalition government were heckled by affected residents at several places for their late response.The so-called step-motherly attitude of Centre towards Assam has given fodder to opposition parties in the state as well.?
