The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), which is prosecuting the Babri demolition cases, had appealed against the high court's order.The Supreme Court today allowed the CBI's appeal and also ordered the clubbing of two trials that are currently going on in the Babri demolition case. 
However, the apex court has now ordered the clubbing of the two cases, ruling that the Lucknow court will also rule on the conspiracy charges against Advani, Joshi, Bharti and others.
