Ved Prakash said, "A big change is taking place in the country. 
Prime Minister Modi has come at the forefront as a yogi (ascetic) and Yogi (Adityanath) has come in Uttar Pradesh. 
I have come here (in the BJP's fold) to become part of that change."
Delhi BJP president Manoj Tiwari said, "The opposition is getting frustrated seeing the rise of BJP, which is why they are making false accusations." 
'KEJRIWAL IS NOT GETTING RIGHT INFORMATION'Ved Prakash also said that Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal is surrounded by people who are giving him wrong information, which is slowing down progress. 
I went there thinking that something new was going to happen.
