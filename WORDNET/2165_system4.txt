Even as he agrees that one cannot deny the existence of nepotism in Bollywood, filmmaker Neeraj Ghaywan, who bagged the National Award for his debut film Masaan, believes the issue has been blown ?
I think the issue (of nepotism) is overblown and has turned pointless now. 
I agree that we need acknowledge that it exists and there is a certain set of privileges that these actors enjoy. 
the filmmaker told Hindustan Times.Richa Chadha in a still from Masaan.Talking about his favourite actors, Neeraj said, ?
Deepika Padukone and Ranbir Kapoor are two actors I would like to work with. 
We are all real heroes giving our extra efforts and we need that dignity and recognition for the efforts,?
