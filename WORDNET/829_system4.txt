New Delhi, Jul 20 (PTI) After its Centre-funded restoration plan got shelved, the NDMC has decided to redevelop the iconic 150-year-old Town Hall in old Delhi through public-private partnership, the civic body today said. 
North Delhi Mayor Preety Agarwal said the redevelopment of the Town Hall in Chandni Chowk -- the headquarters of the erstwhile unified MCD -- into a centre of cultural and social heritage would be taken up on a PPP model. 
He said if all goes well, the fresh project would be taken up in the "next nine months and is likely to be completed within two years". 
Agarwal said the Town Hall would be redeveloped as an attractive tourist destination with "international standards", after which the city landmark would emerge as a centre of cultural and social heritage, depicting the history, culture and the life of Delhi.
