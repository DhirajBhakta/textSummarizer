To streamline the parking of e-rickshaws in the city and avoid congestion on roads, the North Delhi Municipal Corporation has decided to set up charging points for the battery-operated vehicles at select parking lots in its jurisdiction.The agency has finalised six spots where the facility would be developed by next month end.  
So, we have decided to appoint a contractor who will install the charging points at the selected parking lots, collect a minimal amount from e-rickshaws and allow them to charge their vehicles here,? 
he said further.In future, the agency is also planning to open all the parking lots, developed near the Metro stations as charging points for e- rickshaws. ?
