We will support his government from outside but will not join it,"? Bihar BJP president Nitayanand Rai said.Even after the CBI filed a case against him and his family members, the Rashtriya Janata Dal has decided that Deputy Chief Minister Tejashwi Yadav will not resign.Nitish Kumar, who is heading the Grand Alliance government of Janata Dal-United, Rashtriya Janata Dal and Congress in Bihar, is yet to comment on the matter but he spoke with Lalu last night on the phone.There has been speculation of cracks in the alliance government after the CBI crackdown against the Yadav family and Nitish's increasing closeness with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. 
Nitish, who was in an alliance with the BJP for 17 years, has been giving political signals of getting closer to the BJP.Surgical strikes on Pakistan and demonetisation have been a few instances where Nitish has been the lone opposition face to come out and openly extend his support to PM Modi, much to the discomfort of the Opposition, especially RJD chief Lalu Prasad with whose support he is running a coalition government in Bihar.Even in the presidential election, Nitish has decided to support NDA nominee Ram Nath Kovind and not the opposition's candidate Meira Kumar.
