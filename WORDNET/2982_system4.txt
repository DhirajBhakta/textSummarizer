Stars Salman Khan... 22 Dec 2017 release. pic.twitter.com/6CiN4rlGSB If a report in Indian Express is to be believed, Katrina is being trained by the action and stunt director of Hollywood film Dark Knight Rises. 
To shoot for Katrina's action scenes, Tom Struthers, the action and stunts director of the film worked with her. 
Given Struthers shot for certain action sequences for Christopher Nolan's Batman films including the Dark Knight Rises, expect the absolute best from these scenes.
