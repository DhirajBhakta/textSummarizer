Fake accounts in the name of L-G Anil Baijal surfaced on Sunday and Monday, after an account was created by the L-G House on Sunday. 
We received several complaints and alerts from the general public about some fake Twitter accounts. 
Police said they would look into allegations that the fake account users had posed as L-G Baijal and tagged other politicians, including chief minister Arvind Kejriwal. 
Police said two fake accounts have been closed since the matter was reported. 
Baijal told reporters on Saturday that he would work with the Delhi government to solve problems of women safety and pollution in Delhi.
