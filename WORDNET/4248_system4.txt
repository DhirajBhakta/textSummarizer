Chennai, Mar 14 (PTI): Alarmed that "Tamil Nadu may become another Punjab one day" due to easy availability of tobacco products to young students, the Madras High Court today asked authorities to conduct preventive raids to check the malady. 
"If this situation is allowed to continue, one day Tamil Nadu might become another Punjab," observed Justice N Kirubakaran while passing orders on a plea detailing the malady of the shopkeepers selling tobacco products to students and people smoking in public places. 
On petitioner T C Sharaths plea, the bench also directed the officials of Union health ministry, the states Health and Welfare Department, the director general of Tamil Nadu police and Chennai police commissioner to form squads to conduct surprise raids at shops within 100 yards of the educational institutions.
