London, Mar 5 (PTI) Muslim women swimmers have won the right to race in loose-fitting full body outfits or burkinis while taking part in amateur swimming competitions in England. 
The new guidance, which will only apply to amateur competitions in England, states that competitors will not be allowed to wear any suit that a competition referee believes will increase performance, The Telegraph reported. 
"Once the referee has been informed of a swimmer wishing to wear a suit, as described above, there is no requirement for the referee to question the swimmer further, the ASA swimming management group do not want athletes being asked why they wish to wear the suit," it says.
