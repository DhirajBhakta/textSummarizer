Los Angeles, Jun 23 (PTI) Scientists have created a skin patch that can power a radio for two days using human sweat, and may eventually be used to charge mobile devices while people are out for a run. 
The bio fuel patch may also provide a way to monitor glucose levels in people with diabetes, without needles and blood samples, researchers said. 
Getting enough power out of a bio fuel cell to make it useful has proved tricky, but the latest version can extract 10 times more than before, researchers said. 
If you were out for a run, you would be able to power a mobile device," said Joseph Wang from the University of California, San Diego.
