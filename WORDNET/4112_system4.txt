Phillauri is a supernatural comedy where a man gets stuck with a friendly spirit after he is made to marry a tree. 
Shashi's crisis is that she is stuck with Kanan; her story arc is resolved in the most predictable way at the end and it is strange that this was not made the film's focus from the very beginning. 
In friendly-ghost films like these, it is the way the human and the ghost play off each other and the weird situations they create is what makes these films worth watching.But Kanan-Shashi's parts are punctuated by an elaborate backstory that is just dull and Diljit Dosanjh is a decent performer, sure, but he is not a big enough Khan to make mediocre writing worthwhile.
