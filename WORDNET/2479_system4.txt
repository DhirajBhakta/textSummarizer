New Delhi, Jul 12 (PTI) The BJP today hit out at Rahul Gandhi for attacking Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and "not terrorism", after his return from "vacation", hours after the Congress vice president said Modis policies had created space for terrorists in Kashmir. 
BJP spokesperson Meenakshi Lekhi, at a press conference, asked the Congress vice president to read the history of his family, saying that they were responsible for problems in Kashmir. 
She also raked up the 1984 anti-Sikh riots to attack Gandhi over his accusation of "personal gain" at Modi, and said only those behind such riots would consider drawing "personal gain from the blood of innocents".
