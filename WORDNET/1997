With over 1.35 lakh children gone missing in 2015, this group will travel between India Gate and Gateway of India and visit houses on the way to tell people about the menace of child labour. From cold desert to undulating rocky mountains and unending highways, the group will also go door-to-door in the villages falling on way for the cause. The riders will be accompanied by volunteers from Shakti Vahini and volunteers will conduct mass awareness programmes, street plays and skits for generating awareness on ways to combat human trafficking.India is a source, transit and destination point, and an estimated 1.4% of the population is living in modern slavery. ?
