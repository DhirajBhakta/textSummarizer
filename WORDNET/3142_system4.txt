The booklet, which targets the BJP-led NDA government as it completes three years and highlights its failures, was released by Ghulam Nabi Azad? and Raj Babbar.The 11th page of the 16-page booklet talks of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and carries a map of the project. 
The map, seen by India Today, carries the label 'India-occupied Kashmir' for the area of Kashmir. 
Text appearing alongside the map says that the $54 billion CPEC will pass through Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir to connects Gwadar Port in the Arabian sea to China. 
In a bid to target the BJP, Congress wonders if the project raises questions over India's claim on PoK?
