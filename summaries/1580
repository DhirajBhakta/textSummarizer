The Tihar Jail prisoners in Delhi have reportedly launched a series of monthly newspapers, with each newspaper having a circulation of around 100 copies in prison and official circles. While two sub-jails have published their newspapers, the remaining seven are awaiting clearances. One of the four pages of each newspaper is dedicated to covering monthly events at the sub-jails.
