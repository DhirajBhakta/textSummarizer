The last India-China stand-off had taken place in 1967, when over 80 Indian and 300-400 Chinese soldiers were martyred. It had started after the Chinese objected to India putting a wire along the perceived border agreed upon by both sides. A stand-off at the Cho La pass forced the Chinese to withdraw nearly three kilometres away.
