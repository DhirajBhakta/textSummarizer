A man was arrested at the Chennai airport last week allegedly for receiving an audio message seen as anti-national, on his phone. The man was released on Monday after a judge told the police that a random message on a phone was not a sign of anti-national activities. It doesn't warrant arresting someone on charges of sedition, the court added.
