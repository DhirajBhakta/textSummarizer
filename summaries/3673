A six-year-old capybara, member of the world's largest rodent species has given birth to a pup at Chester Zoo, UK. Capybaras are often referred to as giant guinea pigs and can grow to up to 5 feet in length. Notably, the species is threatened due to habitat degradation and illegal poaching for its meat and skin, for making leather.
