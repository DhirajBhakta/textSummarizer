The Election Commission on Wednesday introduced an "open challenge" for people to hack electronic voting machines, starting May first week. This comes after opposition parties urged the poll panel to revert to the paper ballot system while alleging that EVMs were tampered with in elections. The challenge will be open for around 10 days and will have various levels.
