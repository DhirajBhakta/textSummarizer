The National Anthem was allegedly insulted in the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly on Monday as the Opposition's protest continued even as it was being played. The Opposition was trying to disrupt Governor NN Vohra's address to the joint session of the Assembly. Vohra cut his address short and walked away during the National Anthem, BJP's Ravinder Raina said.
