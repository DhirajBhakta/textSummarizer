Snapdeal's board has rejected a takeover offer of $800-850 million (around 5,500 crore) from larger e-commerce rival Flipkart, according to multiple reports. Snapdeal's board felt the proposed takeover amount undervalues the company, reports added. While this offer has been rejected, talks are still said to be on between Snapdeal and Flipkart for a possible deal.
