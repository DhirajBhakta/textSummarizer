As many as 16 private schools in Noida were sent notices for failing to initiate admission process for underprivileged children under the Right to Education Act. The notices were sent based on complaints that schools had been demanding money for admission and were denying admissions. Under RTE, private schools are mandated to offer 25% seats to underprivileged children for free.
