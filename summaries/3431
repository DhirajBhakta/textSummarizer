The panchayat in Bihar's Ibrahimpur village asked a man to pay a compensation of 20,000 to a girl whom he kissed twice on the cheek without her consent when she was returning home. However, the girl refused to take compensation and said, "He (the accused) has earned me much disrepute in the society and he will have to marry me."
