In a first, the National Security Guard (NSG) commandos participated in the Republic Day parade. While a contingent of some 60 commandos in black overalls and full-armed gear marched at the Rajpath, several commandos were on seven vehicles with hydraulic ladders mounted on them. Further, NSG's anti-hijacking van 'Sherpa', a bullet-proof armoured vehicle, also made its debut in the parade.
