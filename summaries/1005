RSS' Muslim wing, Muslim Rashtriya Manch (MRM), has launched a campaign against Chinese rakhi, in Uttar Pradesh's capital Lucknow. The activists have burnt Chinese goods and are circulating WhatsApp messages saying, 'Wear an Indian Rakhi if you care about your country'. "By cooperating with us, buyers and traders can help deflate the Chinese ambitions," said an MRM activist.
