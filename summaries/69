The Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST) is planning to shift its 20-year-old museum from Wadala to Byculla zoo in Mumbai, authorities said. "The museum is far away, and people have often complained they don?t visit as the travel is a pain," said an official. The authorities expect that the shift will bring in more visitors and revenues.
