An 82-foot-long blue whale skeleton has replaced a dinosaur skeleton at London's Natural History Museum, 112 years after the latter was unveiled there. The dinosaur replica, named 'Dippy', was cast from original fossil bones discovered in 1898. The replacement aims to raise awareness for blue whales which have gone down from 2.5 lakh in the 1800s to 20,000, officials said.
