Congress MP Shashi Tharoor on Monday said those disrupting the Parliament should be suspended automatically from the House. "I dont think people have sent me to disrupt the House. However, the culture of Indian politics since independence has sadly taken this shape," he added. He further clarified he hasnt changed his views on this and his party knows this.
