Amid rising cases of violence against doctors, nearly 1,500 resident doctors from New Delhi's AIIMS have decided to learn taekwondo to help defend themselves on duty. Earlier, over 3,000 doctors in Maharashtra had gone on strike for five days over the increasing incidents of violence against doctors. AIIMS doctors had also worn helmets to work in solidarity with their colleagues.
