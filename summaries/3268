Pakistan's lawyers have threatened to launch a nationwide campaign if PM Nawaz Sharif does not resign by May 27. Pakistan's Supreme Court Bar Association and the Lahore High Court Bar Association called for the resignation after the SC's verdict on the Panama Papers, in which Sharif and his son were named for corruption. An inquiry has been ordered against Sharif.
