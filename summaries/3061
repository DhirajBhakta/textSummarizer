Fossils of a complete crocodile, turtles, and bones belonging to at least six different dinosaurs from the Cretaceous Period, 145 to 66 million years ago, have been excavated from a single site in China's Jilin province. The 1.5-metre-long crocodile fossil was well preserved from head to tail, with clear skin, which is quite rare among Cretaceous era findings, scientists said.
