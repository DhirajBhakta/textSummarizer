The Western Railway will introduce 7 new Mumbai local train services in October for commuters travelling between Andheri and Borivali. Two trains will reportedly ply during the morning peak hours and two during the evening. The line between Andheri and Borivali was earlier used for only mail express trains, railway officials said.
