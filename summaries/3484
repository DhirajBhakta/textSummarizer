An 85-kg calf, which was reportedly being kept tied up on the terrace of a four-storey building, jumped from the roof and fell onto a 43-year-old man. The man suffered a fractured leg, several stitches, and a head trauma and was taken to a local hospital. The six-month-old calf, however, could not survive the fall.
