An FIR has been registered against AAP MLA Prakash Jarwal for molesting a 53-year-old woman following a quarrel. Jarwal has refuted the charges, alleging that the complaint was 'politically motivated' and the complainant was a BJP worker. Notably, a similar complaint was filed against Jarwal by a Sangam Vihar resident earlier.
