The Air Traffic Controller (ATC) mixed the location of one plane with that of another that had nearly led to a collision between an IndiGo and a SpiceJet aircraft at Delhi Airport on Tuesday, according to the Airports Authority of India. The two aircraft had reportedly come face-to-face with barely 40 metres between them on the same taxiway.
