An Etihad Airways aircraft carrying nearly 200 passengers suffered a tyre burst upon landing, forcing Mumbai airport authorities to shut operations at the main runway on Monday evening. The Abu Dhabi-Mumbai flight got stuck in the middle of the runway, following which operations were shifted to the secondary runway. Notably, the two runways at Mumbai airport intersect each other.
