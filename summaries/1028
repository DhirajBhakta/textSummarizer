Mumbai Taximens Union and Mumbai Taxi Association have opposed the plan to install Global Positioning System (GPS) devices in their black and yellow taxis, saying that the additional expenses will put a financial burden on drivers. This comes after government's plan to install GPS devices to help track the taxis from control room and to ensure safety of the passengers.
