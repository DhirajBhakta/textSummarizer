Jude Sparks, a 10-year-old kid, accidentally discovered a rare 1.2 million-year-old skull of a stegomastodon, a prehistoric ancestor of elephants, while hiking in the Las Cruces desert in New Mexico, US. "This may be only the second complete skull found in New Mexico", said a University professor who is currently studying the fossil, which weighs about a tonne.
