The Delhi University's Department of Social Work (DSW) hostel has asked residents to wear "proper dress" while in the co-ed common room. However, the head of DSW and provost of the hostel, Prof Neera Agnimitra, said that some girl students had complained about some "improperly dressed" male students sleeping in the common room after two air conditioners were installed there.
