The Bihar Cabinet on Wednesday passed a proposed amendment to the state service rules forbidding government employees from consuming alcohol anywhere in the state. The service rules earlier prohibited government servants from consuming alcohol or any other intoxicant at workplace only. Notably, this comes after the Bihar government imposed a liquor-ban policy across the state in April last year.
