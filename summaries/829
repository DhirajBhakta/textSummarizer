The North Delhi Municipal Corporation on Thursday approved the redevelopment of the 150-year-old Town Hall at Chandni Chowk in Old Delhi through public-private partnership after a 50-crore Centre-funded restoration plan was shelved. The redeveloped complex will feature a craft bazaar, fountain, maze, boutique hotel, food court, sculpture garden, lecture rooms, museum and fine dining areas.
