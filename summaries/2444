An 11-year-old Telangana student committed suicide by jumping off the second floor of his school building after failing to cope with parental pressure to study IIT foundation course. The boy's father said he knew his son was mentally disturbed but never expected him to take this extreme step. Notably, according to NCRB, every hour a student commits suicide in India.
