Russian pranksters fooled US Energy Secretary Rick Perry into believing he was discussing American coal exports and pig manure with Ukrainian PM Volodymyr Groysman. The pranksters convinced Perry that Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko had invented a new biofuel made using pig manure and home-brewed alcohol. Perry called the idea "interesting," saying he looked forward to meeting Poroshenko.
