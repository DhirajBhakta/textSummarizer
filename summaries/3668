A fur coat worn by a stewardess aboard the Titanic has been sold at an auction for over ?1 crore (£150,000), almost twice its valuation. Mabel Bennett is believed to have used the coat for protection when lifeboat crew arrived on the ship. It had been on display in a US museum, after being sold by her family in 1999.
