The Gorkhaland Movement Coordination Committee, an alliance of political parties and organisations protesting for a separate state for the Nepali-speaking population, on Tuesday said it will launch a fast-unto-death from July 15. While the BJP has denied supporting the demand for a separate state, it will take part in the hunger strike to protest against West Bengal's oppression of Gorkhas.
