Delhi's Indira Gandhi International Airport has become a transit point for drug trade with over 19 arrests at the airport so far this year, officials said. This was reportedly double the corresponding number last year. Narcotics Control Bureau's records show that 15 people were arrested for smuggling drugs this year in July, as compared to only two in July 2016.
