UK doctors have found 27 contact lenses stuck together in a 67-year-old woman's eye while they were preparing her for a cataract surgery. The "blueish mass" was causing her discomfort that she attributed to dry eye and old age, doctors said. The patient said she had been wearing disposable contact lenses for 35 years but did not attend regular appointments.
