A 24-year-old woman from Dubai, Moaza Al Matrooshi, had a baby using ovary tissues that were frozen from before she reached puberty. She delivered a baby boy at a privately-run hospital in London on December 13. Moaza had decided to freeze her ovarian tissue because she was born with a blood disorder called thalassaemia.
