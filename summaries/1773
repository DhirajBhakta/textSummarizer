The UK government is encouraging the public to return old £1 coins as the Treasury will be introducing a new 12-sided coin to replace it. The measure has been introduced to end counterfeiting, with reports suggesting nearly 2.55% of the 40 crore old coins in circulation are fake. The old coins shall become invalid by October.
