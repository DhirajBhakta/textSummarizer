Pakistani Army had to be called in to disperse a mob of around 1,000 people who attacked an Ahmadi mosque in Chakwal district in Pakistan's Punjab, according to reports. The minority Ahmadi community has come under attack from Sunni extremists and mobs several times in the recent past. Notably, Pakistan's Ahmadi Muslims community is not recognised as Muslims by law.
