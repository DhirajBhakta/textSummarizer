North Delhi mayor Preeti Aggarwal on Thursday directed the Municipal Commissioner to give all councillors ?25 lakh each during a North Delhi Municipal Corporation (NDMC) meeting. "She directed that each councillor be provided with ?25 lakh for development work in their respective wards," an official said. Delhi government's 'party politics' wasn't allowing NDMC to function, she reportedly said.
