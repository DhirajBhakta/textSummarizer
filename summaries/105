Farmers from 78 villages in Maharashtra are reportedly planning to go on an indefinite fast to protest the alleged forcible acquisition of farm land for the Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor. Despite the project getting scaled down to one-third its original size, the 78 villages have not been denotified, activists said. Officials maintained that they are not planning forcible land acquisition.
