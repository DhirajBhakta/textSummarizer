The Central Information Commission has ordered to make public the statement of Nathuram Godse along with other records related to Mahatma Gandhi's assassination. "One may disagree with Nathuram Godse and his co-accused but we cannot refuse disclosure or circulation of his opinion," CIC stated. The CIC said since the information is more than 20 years old, it cannot be withheld.
