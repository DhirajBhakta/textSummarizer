Saint Teresa's blue-bordered sari was recognised as an Intellectual Property of the Missionaries of Charity after she was cannonised last year, reports said. The charity made the trademark public recently after it witnessed "unfair usage of the design across the globe." It is the first time that a uniform has been protected under the Intellectual Property rights, reports added.
