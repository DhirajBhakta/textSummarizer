Five buildings at Pragati Maidan, including the iconic 45-year-old 'Hall of Nations', were demolished on Sunday night after their architect Raj Rewal lost a case in Delhi High Court. The buildings were commissioned in 1972 and the architect claimed that they were the world's first pillar-less concrete frame structures. A ?2,254-crore world-class exhibition centre is expected to replace them.
