Assam's lone African white rhino, Mohan died at the age of 47 in the zoo on Tuesday. The zoo officials failed to find him a female partner in over four decades of his stay. Mohan, who was brought from US in 1974, often suffered from mood swings and exhibited violent tendencies which officials attributed to his "frustration over sexual inactivity".
