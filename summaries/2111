France has imposed a law requiring citizens to display a "clean sticker" on their vehicles to combat pollution, after smog clouds covered Paris and other French cities. The sticker will indicate the vehicle's age, engine and its cleanliness. France also extended its "superbonus scheme", where owners could receive ?10,000 (?7.14 lakh) for changing their polluting vehicle for an electric one.
