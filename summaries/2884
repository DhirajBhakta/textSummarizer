After Hindi signboards at the recently-unveiled Bengaluru Metro were criticised, Union Minister Venkaiah Naidu said, "Hindi is our national language. India's progress isn't possible without Hindi." Naidu said Hindi is India's mother tongue and Indians should be proud of it. He added, "Angrezi seekhte seekhte hum angrezi mind mein bhi aa gaye hain. Ye desh ke hit mein nahi hai."
