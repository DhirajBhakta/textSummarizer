A baby boy, who survived after being buried alive just 10 days after his birth, was put in a grave in Madhya Pradesh by his minor mother who conceived him after rape. The infant was found on July 3 by a tribal couple and the suspected rapist, also a minor, was arrested after the girl was traced in Maharashtra.
