China has opposed the new US sanctions against North Korea, saying that such sanctions were not conducive to mutual trust and cooperation between China and the US. "China is always opposed to...sanctions outside the framework of the UNSC," officials said. Notably, the new sanctions would affect entities trading with North Korea.
