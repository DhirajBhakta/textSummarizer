Around 80% of the east Delhi sanitation workers, who had gone on an indefinite strike in the wake of non-payment of salaries, have resumed work, according to reports. However, a section of sanitation workers continued to protest outside the East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) headquarter, marking the 10th day of the indefinite strike on Saturday.
