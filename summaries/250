Europe's human rights court has ruled that sex for older women is as important and found a Portuguese court guilty of sexual discrimination in a 50-year-old woman's medical compensation case. Ruling that importance of sex diminished with a woman's age, the Portuguese court had cut the woman's compensation for a botched surgery that left her unable to have normal sex.
