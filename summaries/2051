The Income Tax department on Thursday seized 10.80 crore cash, of which 8.8 crore was in new notes, after searching 15 bank lockers in Pune, officials said. All the bank lockers belong to a single person, they added. The officials further said they found irregularities in the operation of these lockers, which makes it a fit case for tax evasion.
