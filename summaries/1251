The Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) personnel staffed at Terminal 1 and 3 of Delhi Airport will now wear suits instead of standard force uniform, according to reports. They have been asked to wear blazers and trousers with a white shirt and tie. The dress code will be implemented at other airports too based on passenger response, said an official.
