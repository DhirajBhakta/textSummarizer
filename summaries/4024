In an unprecedented move, the Supreme Court on Wednesday ordered the installation of CCTV cameras inside the courtrooms in at least two district courts of all states and Union Territories. The top court, however, made it clear that the footage of the CCTV camera will not be available under the RTI and will be released only on High Courts' direction.
