The Delhi Police requires an additional 54,482 posts to improve patrolling in the capital, according to reports. However, only 14,753 new posts have been approved by the home ministry which are still waiting approval from the "competent authority". Meanwhile, the Delhi High Court has asked the Centre to submit a report on when the new appointments will be made.
