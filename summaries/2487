A Canadian lobster fisherman died after getting struck by a North Atlantic right whale, moments after rescuing it on Monday. Joe Howlett had saved roughly two dozen whales in fifteen years, after they became tangled in fishing nets. The fisheries department said, "taking part in whale rescue operations requires immense bravery and a passion for the welfare of marine mammals."
