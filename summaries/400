The Mumbai Police arrested four auto-rickshaw drivers for allegedly robbing several houses when they were empty. The accused are reportedly wanted in 12 other burglaries and were out on bail. "We had checked the CCTV footage from the areas where they had committed burglaries and could figure out their faces enough to make a sketch," a police official said.
