A bar in Kerala has built a maze around its premises to beat the Supreme Court-ordered ban on the sale of liquor within 500 metres of any National Highway. The maze will increase the motorable distance to reach the bar, and thus it would not fall within the prescribed 500-metre distance. The construction of the maze reportedly cost ?2 lakh.
