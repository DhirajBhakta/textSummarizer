The Border Roads Organisation (BRO) will reportedly construct two tunnels through Arunachal Pradesh's Sela Pass to cut down the distance to the China border through Tawang by 10 km. The tunnels would reduce travel time by at least an hour and ensure that NH13 and the 171-km stretch between Bomdila and Tawang remain accessible in all weather conditions.
