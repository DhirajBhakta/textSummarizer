After the British public voted to name a polar research vessel Boaty McBoatface, Sweden has voted to name a train Trainy McTrainface. Trainy McTrainface received 49% of the votes, beating options like Poseidon and Miriam. Swedes have previously named trains Estelle, after the five-year-old Swedish Princess, and Glenn, after a long-running joke that everyone in Gothenburg city is named Glenn.
