Mumbai's 172-year-old Sir JJ Hospital on Sunday reportedly got its first case of cadaver donation when a 38-year-old brain-dead woman's organs were donated by her family to the hospital. The hospital transplanted her liver and eyes in three patients. The woman was reportedly admitted to the hospital after she met with an accident and was declared brain-dead after some days.
