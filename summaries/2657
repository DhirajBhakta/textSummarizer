Authorities in the Central Luzon region of Philippines are reportedly considering issuing Muslim-only IDs to combat terrorism after a city in Mindanao was captured by Islamist militants. The move would allow identification of undesirable individuals and terrorists, officials said. Notably, President Duterte had blamed people of Marawi for sheltering ISIS sympathisers in the besieged city.
