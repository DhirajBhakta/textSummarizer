Reacting to the recent violence against Africans in India, a group of African envoys said, "India took no action to prevent violence against Africans. It didn't properly condemn the Greater Noida attack." They also termed the attacks against African nationals in India as "xenophobic and racial" and sought an international inquiry into the matter along with demanding strong condemnation.
