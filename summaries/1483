US Defense Secretary Ash Carter on Wednesday said he had opposed commuting the prison sentence of convicted whistleblower Chelsea Manning. President Barack Obama has reduced Manning's 35-year prison term by nearly 29 years. Manning, a former US Army soldier, was convicted in 2013 of espionage and other crimes for leaking classified information while deployed in Iraq.
