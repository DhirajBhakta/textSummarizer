An off-duty Delhi Police constable was shot at and another was hit with a pistol butt by a man who claimed to be a gangster, in front of a housing colony in Narela on Wednesday night. The incident happened after the two constables who were in their private vehicle asked the accused to move his car, which reportedly angered him.
