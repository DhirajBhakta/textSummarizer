A 26-year-old Georgian woman has been arrested for allegedly ramming her car twice into a truck carrying chickens, smashing its license plate. Judith Armstrong, who was tracked down by the police after she fled the scene, said she hit the vehicle because she was vegan. She faces charges of hit-and-run, aggressive driving and obstruction.
