President-elect Ram Nath Kovind, who will take the oath as the country's 14th President, talked about his childhood, saying his election to the post "is to represent all such Kovinds toiling away to make a living". He was born in an Uttar Pradesh village, and his father had to sell off a piece of his land to fund his education.
