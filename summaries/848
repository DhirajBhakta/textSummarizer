Passengers flying to and from Delhi's Indira Gandhi International (IGI) Airport can claim a refund of excess airport charges paid as part of their airfare for travel after July 7, according to reports. This comes after a recent tariff order slashing User Development Fee (UDF) for domestic passengers to 10 from 275-550, and to 45 for international passengers from 635-1,270.
