The Indian Railways has fixed a quota for the lower berth in third AC coaches of trains for 'divyangs', or the differently-abled, reports said. Currently, the provision is available only in sleeper class. Recently, an inquiry was ordered after a wheelchair-bound para-athlete, Suvarna Raj, was forced to sleep on the floor after being denied a lower berth on a train.
