The South Delhi Municipal Corporation is planning to install 100 mobile toilet vans at slum clusters under its jurisdiction to tackle open defecation. An official explained that densely populated areas, especially those near railway lines, have limited space, hence mobile toilet vans need to be placed there. The civic agency has allocated an amount of ?12 crore for the project.
