China has 'vested interest' in helping resolve the Kashmir issue between India and Pakistan, claimed an article in the state-run Chinese daily Global Times. The article claimed that because of China's $50 billion investment in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) that passes through Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir (PoK), it has a bigger role to play as a mediator between the two nations.
