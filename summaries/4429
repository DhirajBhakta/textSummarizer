An Air India flight was forced to make an emergency landing at the Delhi Airport on Monday when the pilot was unable to retract its wheels mid-air. The incident occurred as its engineers had forgotten to remove pins from the landing gear, the airline said. Meanwhile, the Delhi-Cochin-Dubai flight carrying 234 passengers was delayed by over four hours.
