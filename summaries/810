Delhi High Court gave the Home Ministry six weeks to comply with the 2014 judgment, in which the court found BJP and Congress defying the norms of the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act. The Act prohibits political parties or legislator from accepting foreign contributions. In 2014, the court had directed the ministry and Election Commission to take action within six months.
