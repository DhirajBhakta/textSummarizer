A sculpture of enormous hands emerging from a canal has come up in Venice, Italy. The white hands weigh an estimated 2,500 kilogrammes each and are 9 metres high. The hand sculpture, created by artist Lorenzo Quinn using recycled materials, is named 'Support' and aimed at raising awareness of global warming.
