Two children were killed in Mumbai after the wife of an army soldier ran her car over them while learning to drive from her husband, reports said. The victims, aged seven and twelve, were riding bicycles when they came in front of the car. Reportedly, the woman panicked and pressed the accelerator instead of applying the brakes.
