The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has approved Delhi-Panipat and Delhi-Alwar Regional Rapid Transit Systems projects worth 53,500 crore. A ground survey for aligning the projects has already been done and building them along national highways would reportedly reduce time and cost. The NHAI also agreed to take up a project to decongest Delhi by connecting three national highways.
