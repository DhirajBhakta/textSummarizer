Former RJD MP  Mohammed Shahabuddin was charged a fine of ?440 by the TTE onboard the Sampoorna Kranti Express for travelling without a ticket. The incident happened during Shahabuddin's transfer from Patna's Beur jail to New Delhi's Tihar jail. The criminal-turned-politician was being transferred in sleeper class after Supreme Court's directive that he must not be given any VIP treatment.
