US President Donald Trump has claimed that Russian President Vladimir Putin would have preferred a Hillary Clinton victory in the US presidential elections. "Why would he want me...He doesn't want to see that," Trump said. Trump's statement comes amid a probe by federal investigators on whether his campaign advisers colluded with the Russian government to help him win the elections.
