A helicopter carrying pilgrims crashed in Badrinath on Saturday morning, killing a flight engineer and injuring the two pilots. The accident reportedly occurred due to insufficient air pressure in the chopper. The Agusta 119 helicopter, belonging to a Mumbai-based operator, was carrying five pilgrims and three crew members, and was travelling from Badrinath to Haridwar.
