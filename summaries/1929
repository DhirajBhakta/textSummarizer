ISIS-affiliated news agency Amaq has released a video of the alleged Berlin Christmas market attacker, Anis Amri, pledging his allegiance to Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Amri also calls on ISIS supporters to take revenge against "crusaders" bombing Muslims in the video. Italian police officials had shot and killed the truck attack suspect in Milan days after the attack.
