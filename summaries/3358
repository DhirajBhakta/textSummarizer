North Korea on Thursday reserved its sovereign right to "ruthlessly punish" US citizens which it has detained for crimes against the country's government. This comes after North Korea detained two US citizens in the last month. North Korea also slammed US media reports that said the arrests were a bargaining ploy as "pure ignorance".
