A 36-year-old woman and her teenage daughter fell ill after they accidentally cooked and ate a baby snake along with cabbage in Indore, Madhya Pradesh. "A snakes poison becomes dangerous when it mixes in blood and gets circulated. We will monitor the condition of both the patients for the next couple of days," a doctor treating the mother-daughter duo said.
