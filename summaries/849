Uttar Pradesh Police on Wednesday asked local vendors and restaurant owners in Greater Noida not to prepare or serve non-vegetarian food for a week during the period of Kanwar Yatra. Reportedly, the police have taken this decision because the number of pilgrims returning from Haridwar has increased this year and they only prefer vegetarian food.
