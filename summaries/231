A 27-year-old woman has told police that her in-laws poured petrol on her and set her on fire before succumbing to 90% burn injuries at a Delhi hospital. In a previous statement, the woman had claimed that she had burned herself while cooking. However, the victim's family alleged that she gave the first statement under duress.
