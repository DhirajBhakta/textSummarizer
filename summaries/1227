The Delhi High Court on Friday observed that priests should give devotees one or two seconds to communicate with God and should not obstruct them while managing the crowd. "There's only a fraction of a second for a person to view the deity?here the fraction of a second isn't unobstructed," the court said in regards to Kalkaji Temple in Delhi.
