According to an RTI reply, Prime Minister's Office has paid around ?89 lakh to Indian Air Force for flying Narendra Modi on 128 "non-official" domestic trips since he took office. The rates for these flights were last revised 1999, which makes them cheaper to travel in than the commercial flights. The trips were majorly taken by PM to election-bound states.
