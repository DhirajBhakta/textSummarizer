The Bellandur Lake in Bengaluru caught fire again on Thursday, enveloping the area in smoke. "Usually, a pile of garbage strewn around the lake is set on fire, but yesterday... the smoke started billowing and surrounding the lake in the evening," Karnataka Fire Department Deputy Director KU Ramesh said. Notably, there are toxic pollutants and foam in the lake.
