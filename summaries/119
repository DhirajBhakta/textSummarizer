Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Tuesday said in Lok Sabha that the Centre's demonetisation decision has led to squeezing of terror funds, including in Jammu and Kashmir. Jaitley added that as a result of demonetisation, terrorists were forced to rob banks for money, and the number of stone throwers in Jammu and Kashmir has gone down in last few months.
