Aadhaar-issuing authority UIDAI has asked the states to ensure that all enrolments, even those by private agencies, shift to government premises from external sites by September this year. The move will affect 25,000 active enrolment centres across India. The decision is a part of the government's effort to curb the cases of overcharging by private operators.
