The US Air Force is negotiating with Boeing to purchase two 747-8 jetliners once built for Russian airline Transaero, which went bankrupt before the planes were delivered. The jetliners will be used as the new Air Force One and its backup. Air Force One is the aircraft that carries the President of the United States.
