The outgoing Indian Air Force Chief Arup Raha on Wednesday said the worst moment during his tenure was when he heard about an AN-32 plane going missing with 29 personnel on board. Citing that the IAF undertook over 1,000 flying hours to search for the plane, Raha termed it as a mistake of not fitting AN-32s with underwater locator beacons.
