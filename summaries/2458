A Russian court has handed prison sentences ranging from 11 to 20 years to five Chechen men found guilty of killing President Vladimir Putin's vocal critic and opposition leader Boris Nemtsov in 2015. The group reportedly was paid $250,000 for the assassination. Lawyers representing Nemtsov's family claimed that senior figures within Chechnya who are loyal to Putin ordered the killing.
