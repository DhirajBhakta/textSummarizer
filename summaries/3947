India's first transgender Sub-Inspector, K Prithika Yashini, has joined the Tamil Nadu police force after completing her one-year training. Yashini had moved the Madras High Court in 2015 after her application for the post was rejected. The court ordered the authorities to appoint her as an SI and asked for the inclusion of transgenders as a third category.
