The Bombay High Court on Monday summoned the Maharashtra Women and Child Development Secretary after 42 children went missing over the last three years from a Mumbai remand home. The court criticised the Maharashtra government for lack of 'pro-active action' in the matter. The Bombay High Court is hearing a PIL on the allegations of corruption in the remand home.
