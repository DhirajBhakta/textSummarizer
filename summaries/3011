BJP leader Shatrughan Sinha called LK Advani 'pitamah' (father figure) and said the veteran leader should have been the first and last choice for the president's post. "Advani ji is far above others if election is done through a referendum or direct voting by the people, of the people & for the people," Sinha tweeted.
