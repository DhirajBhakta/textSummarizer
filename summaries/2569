The Supreme Court on Tuesday ordered Punjab to complete its share of construction on the disputed Sutlej-Yamuna Link Canal. "How much water should be shared can be decided later," the court added and fixed the next hearing for September 7. Notably, Haryana completed its portion of constructing the canal, which will carry its share of Ravi-Beas water through Punjab.
