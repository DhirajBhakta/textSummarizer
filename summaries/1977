The Delhi government has decided to install solar plants at the city's major art and culture hubs and will start with the Pitampura and Janakpuri Dilli Haats. "Dilli Haat, Pitampura will almost become power sufficient through this... initiative," an official said. Delhi's Solar Policy mandates certain government buildings to generate 5 kW solar power or 15% of the sanctioned load.
