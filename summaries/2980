Hours before the 1993 Mumbai serial blasts accused were to be sentenced on Friday, the Mumbai Police control room received a bomb threat. The caller said a person named Manoj would trigger several bombs. Policemen identified the caller as 27-year-old Abhimanyu, who was drunk and had wanted to punish his friend Manoj for owing him money from a drinking session.
