An Afghan national, who had swallowed 57 heroin-filled capsules worth 2 crore, fell unconscious at Delhi Airport and was later arrested. The man was going back to Afghanistan after being unable to sell any drugs in Delhi. He was offloaded by the airline when he felt unwell and was sent to the hospital, where the capsules were taken out.
