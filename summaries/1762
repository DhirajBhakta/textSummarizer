Delhi Metro's move to make 10 stations cashless has been halted after CM Arvind Kejriwal questioned allowing payments only through Paytm. "How can they force a decision like this? They are promoting Paytm through this. I will seek an inquiry," said Kejriwal. However, Delhi Metro Rail Corporation has said that Paytm won the contract through an open tender.
