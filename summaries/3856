The 14th Dalai Lama said that historically the Indians and Tibetans have had a long, enduring relationship as teachers (gurus) and disciples (chelas). "We are not only chelas but quite reliable chelas," he added. The Dalai Lama, who was on a nine-day visit to Arunachal Pradesh, has traveled to the Indian state on six earlier occasions since 1983.
