Urging the Centre to declare cow as the national animal, Rajasthan High Court judge Mahesh Chandra Sharma today said that peacock is the national bird because it doesn't have sex to reproduce. "The peahen gets pregnant by drinking the tears of the peacock. Even Lord Krishna carried the feather of a peacock on his head for this reason," Sharma added.
