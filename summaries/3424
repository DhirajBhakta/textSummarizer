A 15-year-old girl was locked inside a house in east Delhi's Krishna Nagar locality for two years by her mother. The matter came to light after a neighbour informed the Delhi police, who raided the house and rescued the girl. The girl's mother reportedly used to visit the house only in the evening to bring food for the girl.
