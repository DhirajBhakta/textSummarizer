New Explosive Trace Detectors at Delhi Airport can trace if any items in passengers' bags were in contact with any explosives in the past 24 hours. Shaped like card swipe machines, they are used on random passengers to increase security in the check-in area. The CISF said they can penetrate into bags, meaning they do not need to be opened.
