The Paris canal opened to swimmers after nearly a century was temporarily closed within a week due to pollution and "unsatisfactory" water quality. The temporary swimming zones at the canal were the culmination of a 10-year effort by officials to purify the canal water. Swimming in Paris' city waters was banned in 1923 over fears of currents and water quality.
