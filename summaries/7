A 60-year old Dalit woman was allegedly lynched in Agra after villagers thought that she was behind the recent cases of chopping hair of sleeping women. The family members of the woman who left home around 4 am on Wednesday said, "She pleaded that she had lost her way but they took her as one responsible for chopping women hair."
