ISRO launched India's heaviest and most powerful rocket GSLV MK-III on Monday, also carrying GSAT-19, the heaviest satellite launched by an Indian rocket. The 3,136-kg communications satellite is the first to be powered by indigenous Lithium-ion batteries and can be the first to provide "Internet services using a space-based platform". It will also help study space radiation effects on satellites.
