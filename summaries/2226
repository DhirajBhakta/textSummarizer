The Central Pollution Control Board is planning to develop a city-specific 'driving cycle' and location-specific air quality management in Delhi. Notably, driving cycles estimate how much pollution a vehicle is emitting and its fuel consumption. The plan will be pursued with the money which manufacturers and dealers deposited with the Board over the last one year as Environment Protection Charge.
