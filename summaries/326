US President Donald Trump has forced out his White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and named the Homeland Security Secretary, General John Kelly, as the replacement. This comes after Trump's new Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci slammed Priebus as a "fu**ing paranoid schizophrenic". Priebus has reportedly claimed that he resigned privately on Thursday.
