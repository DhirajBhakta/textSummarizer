A member of Sikh community's Damdami Taksal seminary has filed a writ petition in the Bombay High Court against Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale being called a 'terrorist' in Maharashtra State Board's Class 9 textbooks. The petition demanded that the 'objectionable part' be removed immediately. Notably, Bhindranwale was a militant preacher, killed in a military operation at Golden Temple in 1984.
