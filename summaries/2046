Incidents of rape in Delhi have risen over three times since the December 16 Nirbhaya gang rape case, from 706 in 2012 to 2,199 in 2016. The police attributed the increase to more women coming forward to lodge complaints after the incident. However, the conviction rate for rape incidents dropped from 49.25% of cases in 2012 to 29.37% in 2015.
