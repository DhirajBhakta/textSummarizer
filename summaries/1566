Around 18 Democratic lawmakers have said they will boycott US President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration ceremony on January 20. This comes after intelligence agencies concluded that Russia intervened in the polls and helped Republican Trump win. Civil rights leader and Democratic party lawmaker John Lewis, who was slammed by Trump for not recognising his presidency, is among those not attending.
