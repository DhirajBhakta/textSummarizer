UK PM Theresa May has suspended Conservative MP Anne Morris after she described the country's departure from the European Union without an agreed deal as "the real n****r in the woodpile". Morris was accused of racism for using the N-word and PM May denounced it as "completely unacceptable". Morris later apologised for her remark, saying "the comment was totally unintentional".
