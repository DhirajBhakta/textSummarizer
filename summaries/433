Food regulator FSSAI has banned the use of staple pins in tea bags from January next year citing serious health hazards. Use of staple pins in tea bags poses potential hazards since any loose pin consumed inadvertently can cause serious health problems, the order said. At present, types of tea bags available in the market are either stapled or knotted.
