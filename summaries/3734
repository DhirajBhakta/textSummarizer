During the farmers' protest against the Centre's inaction over the drought in Tamil Nadu, a man dressed up as PM Narendra Modi was seen beating a farmer with a whip in Delhi. "By ignoring us, it is like Modi...trying to beat us out of Delhi," a farmer said. The farmers had earlier held protests wearing sarees and carrying skulls.
