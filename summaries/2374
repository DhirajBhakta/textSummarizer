A stray dog on Thursday mauled three junior class students outside a Ghaziabad school when they were heading towards their transport vehicles. Members of the People for Animals said they had picked up the stray dog and suspect it was suffering from rabies. Residents claimed to have often taken up the issue with the municipal corporation, but the menace continues.
