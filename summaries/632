A Maharashtra education board has introduced a compulsory six-week internship in the last year of diploma engineering courses as part of a new curriculum. Authorities said the new curriculum will provide practical training and "industry-relevant" skills to the students. The decision was allegedly taken after the number of admission-seeking students reportedly declined by 38% in the last two years.
