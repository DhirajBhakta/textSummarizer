A 26-year-old entered a restricted forest area of Karnataka's Thattekere Lake and lost his arm in an attack by a crocodile while trying to help his two dogs out of the lake. The incident happened when the IIT graduate, who is also a CEO of a startup, was out on a trekking expedition along with a friend and his dogs.
