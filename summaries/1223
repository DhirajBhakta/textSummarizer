Social media users have criticised the cover of the 125th-anniversary issue of fashion magazine 'Vogue' for an alleged lack of diversity. The cover has featured only one plus-size model, Ashley Graham. Readers have also accused 'Vogue' of featuring only light to medium skin-toned models. Further, it has been slammed for reportedly photoshopping Gigi Hadid's arm to cover Graham's torso.
