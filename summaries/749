Experts who exhumed late artist Salvador Dalí's body have revealed his moustache remains intact, nearly three decades after his death. Narcís Bardalet said, "His moustache is still intact, (like clock hands at) 10 past 10, just as he liked it." His body was exhumed to settle a paternity case, wherein a woman claimed her mother and Dali had an affair.
