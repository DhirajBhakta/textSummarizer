A female senior police officer, who had confronted a mob of BJP workers, is among the 234 officers who received transfer orders in Uttar Pradesh. Senior officer Shreshtha Thakur's video of handling the mob and arresting five for bullying had earlier gone viral. Thakur was reportedly transferred following a meeting of BJP MLAs and MPs with UP CM Yogi Adityanath.
