The lawyer representing Pakistan at the ICJ in the Kulbhushan Jadhav case has rejected rumours that he charged over 4 crore for the case. "My fees were not even 10 per cent...I cancelled another professional commitment with another government to travel to Pakistan urgently," Khawar Qureshi said adding that he gave a 30% deduction in his fee.
