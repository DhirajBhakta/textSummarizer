Holding Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan responsible for the killings of RSS members, a Madhya Pradesh RSS leader has announced a bounty of 1 crore on his head. Dr Chandrawat said he would even sell his property if he had to give the reward for Vijayan's head. Notably, as many as eight BJP-RSS members have been murdered in Kerala since 2016.
