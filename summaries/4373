Indians are a valuable community of Kansas and they are welcome in the state, Governor Sam Brownback has told Indian diplomats and community members. The statement comes after Indian engineer Srinivas Kuchibhotla was killed in a shooting in a Kansas City bar earlier this week. "The hateful actions of one man doesn't define us," the Governor added.
