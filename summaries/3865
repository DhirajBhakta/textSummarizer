Vipin Khadse, a final year MBBS student, helped a woman give birth on a moving train in Maharashtra. The 24-year-old used WhatsApp to seek instructions from his seniors and even revived the newborn who had not been breathing. The relatives of the patient gave Khadse 101 to thank him for the delivery.
