Homegrown e-wallet FreeCharge has dismissed reports that suggested global payments platform PayPal is set to buy a 25% stake in the company. Media reports claimed on Sunday that PayPal is expected to take a significant stake in FreeCharge for around $200 million.  "There is no such discussion or proposal and the story is completely incorrect," a FreeCharge spokesperson said.
