The southwest monsoon on Sunday arrived in Andaman and Nicobar islands ahead of its schedule. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued a warning for heavy rainfall at isolated places over the region between May 14 and 16. Though the IMD hasn't predicted about the southwest monsoon over Kerala, forecaster Skymet said its likely to hit Kerala on June 1.
