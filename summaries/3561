The Central Railway has been asked by Madhya Pradesh's Betul district consumer dispute redressal forum to pay ?5,000 for failing to wake up a passenger who had registered for the wake-up call service. Girish Garg had boarded Coimbatore-Jaipur Superfast Express in 2015 and requested the Railways' customer care to wake him up before the arrival of his destination at Kota.
