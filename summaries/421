The Jawaharlal Nehru University in Delhi has made it mandatory for MPhil and PhD students to fill their dissertation submission forms in both Hindi and English. Students who didn't know Hindi complained as they couldn't submit their dissertation. The university said the step was taken so that there is no spelling error on the certificates given to students.
