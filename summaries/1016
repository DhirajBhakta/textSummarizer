Rajasthan University is set to include a book on Mughal emperor Akbar's Haldighati's defeat by Rajput king Maharana Pratap in its History department's curriculum from this year. The book by Dr Chandra Shekhar Sharma projects Pratap as a great freedom fighter. Notably, the idea to teach Akbar's 'defeat' was first mooted by BJP MLA Mohan Lal Gupta earlier this year.
