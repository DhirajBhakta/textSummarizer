Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray on Tuesday defended the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation over waterlogging problems in Mumbai. Speaking at the inauguration of an arts theatre, Thackeray said, "What would the BMC do if it rains heavily?" Notably, heavy rainfall since Monday has caused slow traffic and waterlogged roads, leading to commuter woes across the city.
