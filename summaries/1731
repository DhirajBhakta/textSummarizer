The Meghnagar Nagar Panchayat in Madhya Pradesh's Jhabua district has put up messages threatening death for those found defecating in the open while calling for a "Swachh Bharat", reports said. This comes a week after civic body workers harassed an elderly man and forced him to clean his crap with his clothing in Madhya Pradesh's Ujjain.
