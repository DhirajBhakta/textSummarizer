Odisha's Home Guards Reserve Inspector Ashok Kumar Sethi made four Home Guards in the state go on their knees with their hands up as punishment for wearing improper uniform. Sethi said that he was chided by his seniors and he did not take the "disciplinary action" to embarrass them, but to make them realise "the essence of discipline".
