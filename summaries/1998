Around 35,000 students in Delhi government schools will be tested for learning disabilities and will be provided with special learning support, reports said. This comes after a government campaign found that these students were able to identify only alphabets despite having cleared Class V. The initiative is aimed at preventing the possibility of neglect of such children in schools.
