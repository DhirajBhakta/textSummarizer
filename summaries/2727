The Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) officials have covered the Hindi words on signboards outside metro stations after pro-Kannada organisations issued a warning in this regard expressing displeasure. The activists started online campaign #NammaMetroHindiBeda to remove Hindi signage and the BMRCL took the step to cover the Hindi words in order to avoid any more trouble.
