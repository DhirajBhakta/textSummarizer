Over 200 sheep plunged to their deaths from a 200 metre-high cliff on the France-Spain border, while reportedly trying to escape a brown bear. The bodies of 169 sheep were found in Spanish village Lladorre, while the rest were found in France. The flock of sheep, belonging to a French farmer, had panicked after the bear attacked one of them.
