Journalists were barred access to the wife of recently deceased Nobel Peace laureate Liu Xiaobo by Chinese agents. Earlier, Chinese authorities had said Liu Xia, who has been under effective house arrest since her husband won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010, was free to leave the country if she wishes. Xiaobo died of liver cancer earlier this month.
