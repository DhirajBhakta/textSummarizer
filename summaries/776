Air India is preparing a list of former employees suspected of siphoning off artwork, after several paintings from its collection were reported missing. An official said Air India lent its artwork to top executives but no one knew when the practice began. The move comes after a Jatin Das painting was returned anonymously to the airline in a damaged condition.
