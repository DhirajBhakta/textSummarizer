Pakistan's national carrier Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) will suspend flights between Mumbai and Karachi from May 15, according to reports. The move is said to be the result of falling passenger traffic as fewer people are being sanctioned visas. PIA also operates flights from Lahore and Karachi to Delhi and is the only airline operating flights between the two countries.
