Twenty-six-year-old Sara Geurts from Minnesota, US, who was diagnosed with a rare type of skin disorder called Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome when she was 10, has started modelling. The disorder causes skin and joints to stretch beyond normal and become wrinkly. "Each imperfection you have is individual to you, and it tells a story about you and who you are," said Sara.
