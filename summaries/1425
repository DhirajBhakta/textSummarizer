Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill once called Mahatma Gandhi "a seditious Middle Temple lawyer, now posing as a fakir... striding half-naked up the steps of the Viceregal Palace." Churchill was unhappy at Gandhi's participation at the Second Round Table Conference in London in 1931. Churchill even suggested Gandhi should be allowed to die if he goes on hunger strike.
