The UK has lifted an in-cabin laptop ban on Turkish Airlines and Pegasus. The Transport Department said the restrictions "will be lifted on a case-by-case basis once the UK government has verified that airlines have put in place alternative security measures." The UK had imposed the ban on direct flights from Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, Egypt, Tunisia and Saudi Arabia.
