India has voluntarily contributed $100,000 to a UN fund to help developing countries actively participate in the discussion of tax issues, becoming the first country to voluntarily contribute. The UN Tax Trust Fund has called for voluntary contributions since its establishment in 2006. Handing over the cheque, India expressed hope that other countries would also contribute.
