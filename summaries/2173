The Noida administration has proposed that Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) collect tax from commercial vehicles at the Delhi-Noida-Delhi (DND) Flyway toll plaza in order to reduce traffic congestion. Currently, the MCD uses a makeshift booth 500 metres beyond the toll plaza to collect the tax. The plaza was shut after the toll was discontinued by the Allahabad High Court.
