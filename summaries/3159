American journalist Megyn Kelly is being trolled on Twitter for asking India's PM Narendra Modi, "Are you on Twitter", after he referred to her recent tweet with an umbrella. "While @narendramodi had done his homework Ms. Kelly had not researched her subjects well," a tweet read. Citing Kelly's and Modi's Twitter followers, another user tweeted, "2.3M vs 30M+ followers. :-D."
