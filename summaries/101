A swarm of bees reportedly attacked a Hyderabad-Pune flight last week and delayed it by almost an hour. The flight was able to take off only after a repellent spray was used to clear the insects from the area. "We will look into the matter and necessary action will be taken," a Directorate General of Civil Aviation official said.
