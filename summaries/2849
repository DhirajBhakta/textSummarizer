People in Haryana's Kandhawali village wore black arm bands during Eid namaaz to protest against the lynching of 17-year-old Junaid on a train last week. Junaid's brothers were also injured by the mob. According to one of his brothers, Hashim, the 20-25 people who attacked them, pointed to the caps on their heads, and called them Pakistani, anti-national and beef-eater.
