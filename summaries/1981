The Delhi Police has decided to procure high-definition video cameras and install them in 1,000 PCR vans. ?The objective of the initiative is to get first-hand evidence of any crime and use it to make the case stronger against the accused,? said a senior police officer. This video can be later used as an evidence in the court, reports said.
