After a Kerala couple's Facebook Live video of the cops moral policing them over public display of affection (PDA) went viral recently, the state police chief has posted an apology note on his Facebook page. "In our country we impose self-restrain on PDA due to our culture and tradition," writes the chief, "though there is no legal ban for PDA."
