A father-son duo, who were owners of a roadside eatery in Delhi's Najafgarh, were shot dead by four people on Wednesday, following an argument over the direction of air-cooler. Reportedly, the accused had insisted on turning the cooler vent to their direction after which they shot the owners when they rejected their demand, saying other customers also required the cooler.
