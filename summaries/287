After a JNU student's Facebook post alleging he was beaten up at a Delhi metro station by CISF personnel went viral, the organisation has ordered an enquiry into the matter. The student also mentioned the personnel made remarks like he would be "sent to Pakistan". The personnel got enraged when he 'defied' their instructions to take off earphones, he said.
