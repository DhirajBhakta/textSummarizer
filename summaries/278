Jammu & Kashmir CM Mehbooba Mufti on Friday said no one will hold the tricolour if Kashmiri citizens' privileges are altered. "Let me be very clear. By doing this (challenging Article 35-A), you are not targeting the separatists," Mufti said. "Their (separatists') agenda is different and totally secessionist but you are weakening those powers which trust India," she added.
