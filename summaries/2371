The Bombay High Court granted a compensation of ?2 lakh to a 63-year-old murder convict as he was illegally detained in jail for three years and nine months beyond his sentence. A bench of justices directed the government to pay him within 45 days, failing which it would have to shell out interest at the rate of 12% a year.
