Minority Affairs Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi on Monday said that the Centre will organise 'cashless chaupals' for minority communities to educate them about the cashless economy. Naqvi added that the cashless economy chaupals will be held after the ongoing Winter Session of Parliament is over. He claimed that this will make the lives of minorities "even more convenient".
