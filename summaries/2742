The CISF security cover at the Delhi Airport has been rated the best service in the world by quality rating agency World Quality Congress. CISF said keeping a check on criminal activities at the airport and restoring passengers' forgotten items have helped it fetch the award. The WQC will hand over the award to CISF later this week in Mumbai.
