The US on Wednesday listed Pakistan among a list of nations providing "safe havens" to terrorists and said groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed continue to operate and organise in the country. The annual 'Country Report on Terrorism' said, "Pakistan did not take sufficient action" against the groups and did not limit their ability to threaten US interests in Afghanistan.
