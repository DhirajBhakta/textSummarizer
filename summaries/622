Snooty, the oldest known manatee in the world, passed away on Sunday, a day after celebrating his 69th birthday. His death appeared to be a "heartbreaking accident" as Snooty died after getting stuck in a maintenance hatch, South Florida Museum CEO Brynne Anne Besio said. "We?re all devastated... staff, volunteers and board members considered him a star," Besio added.
