After the Supreme Court upheld death penalty to four convicts in the 2012 Nirbhaya gangrape case, the convicts' lawyer said, "We will file review petition after reading the order." Alleging that the human rights of the convicts have been neglected, he added, "Justice is not done... You cannot give a death sentence to anyone for a message to the nation."
