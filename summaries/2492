The Bombay high court stopped criminal proceedings for sexual harassment charges against a 20-year-old man when he agreed to clean a children's home every Sunday for the next three months. The bench said it considered his age and willingness for community service. The proceedings will restart if he fails to produce a certificate by the head of the children's home.
