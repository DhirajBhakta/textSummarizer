A hotel in Bengaluru denied a room to an interfaith married couple on Tuesday stating that they don't give rooms to Muslims and Hindus who are together. The receptionist was quoted saying that he hails from a place where Hindus don't marry Muslims. He further said it is possible that interfaith couples just "go into the room and hang themselves".
