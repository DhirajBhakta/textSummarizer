The Maharashtra government's proposal to transfer tribal land in Palghar to iPhone manufacturer Foxconn has sparked protests by locals. The land, which had been acquired earlier for a project that did not start, was lying unclaimed and some original owners continued farming. A government official said Foxconn will be more interested in this location due to its proximity to Mumbai.
