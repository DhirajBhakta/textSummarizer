Delhi Deputy CM Manish Sisodia on Tuesday said the Delhi government-run schools can appoint retired teachers without getting prior approval from the education department in case of shortage of teachers. The policy would allow principals to hire teachers for a three-month period and would ensure that children do not suffer due to lack of teachers, the minister added.
