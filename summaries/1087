The Tirupati Laddu caused an annual loss of over 140 crore to the temple administration of Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam for the last three years. The loss was owed to its subsidised price and free distribution to devotees, according to reports. The laddu is being sold at a price of 25 per piece while its actual cost was 32.50, reports said.
