An online donation drive to rebuild a mosque that was gutted by fire in the US state of Texas has raised over $800,000 (over ?5.4 crore), reports said. Nearly 18,000 people have helped to raise the funds within a day. The mosque had been burnt down hours after President Donald Trump announced the ban on immigrants from seven Muslim-majority countries.
