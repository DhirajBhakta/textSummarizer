Robert Pious, one of the convicts in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case, has written to the Tamil Nadu government seeking mercy killing. "I've been in prison for more than 27 years now...I can understand the intention of the government and as none of my family members have come to see me, I don't find anymore purpose in life," he said.
