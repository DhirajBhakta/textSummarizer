As many as 76 passengers were rescued from cable cars suspended over a river in German city Cologne after a gondola crashed into a support pillar on Sunday. Passengers were left stranded, and children were seen clinging to parents while dangling as many as 40 metres above the river. The fire department lowered them to safety from the cable cars.
