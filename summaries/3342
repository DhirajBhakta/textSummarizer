PM Narendra Modi will inaugurate India's longest river bridge, the 9.15-km-long Dhola-Sadiya bridge near the China border, on May 26. Situated over the Brahmaputra river at an aerial distance of around 100 km from the Chinese border, the bridge can withstand the weight of a 60-tonne battle tank. The bridge's construction began in 2011 at a cost of ?950 crore.
