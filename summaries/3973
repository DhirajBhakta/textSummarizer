China will launch a network of 156 minisatellites to facilitate global broadband coverage and commercial space development. The small low-cost satellites would be placed in an orbit 1,000 km above Earth to form a network to improve internet access. The project plans to send the first satellite before 2018, and all 156 satellites by 2025, Chinese news agency reported.
