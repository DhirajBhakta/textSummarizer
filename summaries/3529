Fresh clashes took place in Jammu and Kashmir on Monday after several students put out posters of slain Hizbul commander Burhan Wani on the administrative block of the Pulwama degree college. While some students hoisted flags of Pakistan and terror outfit ISIS in the college premises, others also pelted stones at the police.
