Indian Navy on Friday successfully conducted the first test fire of the land-attack variant of the BrahMos supersonic missile. The missile, with a 400 km range, was launched at sea off the Andaman and Nicobar islands. This is reportedly the first sea-to-land missile test in the country and also the first time the land-attack variant was fired from a ship.
