The Delhi High Court reduced the compensation awarded to a motor accident victim by 45% after it found negligence on the part of both parties. A compensation of 10 lakh was earlier awarded to the victim. The court observed, "It's possible despite the vehicle being driven in permissible limit, an accident can occur when a jaywalker suddenly appears on road."
