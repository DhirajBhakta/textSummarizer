Kolkata-based bakery 'Krazy for Chocolates' has introduced dark chocolate replicas of the old 500 and 1000 notes. The bakery said, "The base is chocolate and the layout of the notes is painted with edible sugar paint." People have asked if the chocolates, which cost 100 each, are edible, and ordered them for their parties and events, the bakery added.
