The Ministry of External Affairs has rubbished a report about the killing of Indian soldiers in Sikkim, published by the Pakistan media. Ministry spokesperson Gopal Baglay said that the report is utterly baseless, malicious, and mischievous. A Pakistani media organisation had reported that at least 158 Indian soldiers were killed on Monday after China fired along the Indian border.
