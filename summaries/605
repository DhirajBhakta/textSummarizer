Maharashtra's Barvi dam, which provides water to most cities in Thane district, has been filled up to 99% of its total capacity due to heavy rainfall. Officials said that water stock from the dam will ensure that only nominal water cuts happen next year. Notably, the height of the dam was increased in 2016 to accommodate more water stock.
