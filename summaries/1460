Oxford University has been directed to face trial over a claim for $1 million (around 6.8 crore) compensation after an Indian-origin student Faiz Siddiqui sued the varsity for "hopelessly bad" and "boring" teaching, according to reports. Oxford University had argued that the claim was baseless and should be struck out because it had been over 16 years since Siddiqui graduated.
