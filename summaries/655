After 19 Mumbai suburban railway stations were equipped with free WiFi earlier this month, the authorities said they were receiving complaints of non-commuters and miscreants using the facility to watch porn. Reportedly, officials now plan to urge the service providing agency, RailTel, to shut the WiFi post-midnight or after the departure of the last train from the stations.
