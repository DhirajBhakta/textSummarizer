Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj has sent a Note Verbale requesting the safety, security and well-being of Mohammadia Begum, an Indian woman who was being mistreated by her in-laws in Pakistan. Swaraj asked the Indian High Commission to renew the Indian woman's passport and facilitate her return to India. This comes after Swaraj received a YouTube message from the victim's father.
