The Indian Army WhatsApp number launched to address the grievances of jawans has been spammed by Pakistanis to abuse India. "We have been receiving messages in large number from Pakistan and that is why, we have barred all Pakistani numbers from sending messages to it," the Army reportedly stated. The number was launched on January 28.
