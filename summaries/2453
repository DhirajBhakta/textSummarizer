Ola and Uber drivers have sought BJP's support in scrapping 'strict' clauses from Mumbai's new City Taxi Scheme, which aims to provide a level-playing field for all types of cabs. Under this scheme, the permit fee for Ola and Uber drivers reportedly ranges from ?25,000 to ?2.61 lakh, while no such fee is levied on black-and-yellow and Cool Cab drivers.
