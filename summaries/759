The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram on Thursday sealed 70 shops of a building in Sector 74 after the owners reportedly didn't pay property tax. "Despite tax defaulters being issued multiple notices, many have failed to pay up. The sealing serves as a warning before the auctioning," said an official. MCG is expected to auction over 500 properties from August 8.
