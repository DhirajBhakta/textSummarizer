Bangladesh court has ordered doctors to write easy-to-read prescriptions in block letters or type them to prevent wrong medicines being issued to patients. The government has been asked to issue a circular for the same and provide a report within six weeks. The court also said that doctors must use generic drug names rather than specifying particular brands.
