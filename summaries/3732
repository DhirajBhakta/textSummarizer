At least six people were killed in a fire that struck an electronic goods factory in Noida's Sector 11 on Wednesday afternoon. The factory's employees claimed that fire tenders reached the spot about 90 minutes after the complaint was registered. Goods estimated to be worth around 15 crore were destroyed in the fire, which was caused by a short circuit.
