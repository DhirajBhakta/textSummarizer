Goa Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar on Tuesday said that the state is planning to provide financial assistance to farmers to help them take care of their old cows. "The economical viability of maintaining a cow lasts till it gives milk. Once the cow becomes old, it is uneconomical and unaffordable for the farmers," Parrikar added.
