All G20 member countries except the US on Saturday reaffirmed the 2015 Paris climate accord as "irreversible". German Chancellor Angela Merkel said there had been no compromise on climate change and called the US position "regrettable". However, the US affirmed its strong commitment to an approach that lowers emissions while supporting economic growth and improving energy security needs.
