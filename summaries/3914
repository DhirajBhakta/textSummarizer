The Maharashtra Assembly on Thursday passed a bill to amend the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act to legalise bullock cart races in the state. The amendment is aimed at ensuring the preservation of native breeds of bulls, reports said. Earlier, Tamil Nadu had passed a similar bill to overturn a Supreme Court-ordered ban on the bull-taming sport of Jallikattu.
