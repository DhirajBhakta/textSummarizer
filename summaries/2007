The house in Austria, where Adolf Hitler was born will be turned into the headquarters of a charity for the disabled. This comes after the Austrian Parliament passed a law on Wednesday, allowing the authorities to seize it from its current owner. Owner Gerlinde Pommer had refused to sell the house for years, and once operated it as a guesthouse.
