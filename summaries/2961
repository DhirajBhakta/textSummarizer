Homestay startup Airbnb is buying California-based background-check startup Trooly that was founded by three Indian-origin entrepreneurs in 2014. Trooly, co-founded by Savi Baveja, Anish Das Sarma and Nilesh Dalvi, helps predict the trustworthiness of individuals and businesses. Airbnb will use Trooly's technology to protect its users and hosts from fraudulent people and scams.
