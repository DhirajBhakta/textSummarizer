China has demoted Communist party official Jelil Matniyaz in the Uygur Muslim majority-Xinjiang province for not "daring" to smoke in front of local religious leaders, said a notice posted online. An official added, "his behaviour of not daring to smoke conforms with extreme religious thought... As a party chief, he should lead the fight against extreme religious thought."
