The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has issued a notice to NGO Praja Foundation for 'misrepresenting' data in a report stating that a third of the children in BMC schools are malnourished. Officials accused the NGO of not factoring in changes in the screening process for malnourishment. The civic body demanded a public apology and threatened legal action against the NGO.
