The CRPF officials have reportedly said the Chhattisgarh Police didn't provide intelligence prior to Sukma Naxal attack. "The Naxals had forewarned villagers from venturing out of their homes," a report stated. As per instructions, state police needs to have at least 33% of the CRPF strength, but in Sukma, on most occasions, there's barely even one, said an official.
