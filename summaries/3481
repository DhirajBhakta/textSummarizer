Welspun Group heiress Radhika Goenka is set to start her own line of women's innerwear later this month, which will install fully functional lingerie vending machines in India starting from Mumbai. The vending machines will be stocked with pre-packaged lingerie products in multiple styles and sizes. Consumers will be able to purchase lingerie with just one click through these machines.
