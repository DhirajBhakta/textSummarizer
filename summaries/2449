The government has extended financial powers to the Army Vice-Chief to make emergency purchases to keep the force ready for 'short intense wars'. The Army has identified 46 kinds of ammunition apart from spares for 10 weapons platforms, which can be purchased through the emergency route. Further, there is no limit on expenditure to purchase minimum ammunition for Army's reserve.
