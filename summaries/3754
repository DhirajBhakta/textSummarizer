Scientists have developed a lightweight, paper-based device that can harvest energy from body movements. The inner surfaces are coated with gold and a carbon polymer film, comprising the electric nanogenerator. Pressing and releasing the device for a few minutes charged the device to 1 volt, which was enough to power a remote control or a watch, researchers said.
