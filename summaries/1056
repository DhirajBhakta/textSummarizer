An image of a pregnant US President Donald Trump being hugged by Russian President Vladimir Putin from behind was projected on buildings in New York along with #LoveThroughHate. The image was a part of an ad campaign by the dating app Hater. "We're just trying to make people laugh. Through humour, hate can turn into love," the app's representatives said.
