The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) is set to install 400 new card swipe machines for the facilitation of online transactions at its stations. Cash transactions have significantly reduced at metro stations since demonetisation and DMRC has started accepting payments through Paytm. This comes after several commuters complained of network issues and failed transactions.
