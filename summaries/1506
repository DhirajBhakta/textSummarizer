A 55-year-old police inspector tasked with disposing of seized drugs was found with ecstasy, heroin, cocaine, and cannabis worth £700,000 (about ?6 crore) at his house, a UK court was told. The inspector supplied the drugs to others, the prosecutor said, adding, "What was found... would have kept a 1970s rock star, as well as his band, entertained for weeks."
