An Uber taxi was set on fire by protesters on Tuesday in Ghaziabad amidst the ongoing strike by drivers of app-based cab aggregators in Delhi NCR demanding better pay. The protesters allegedly hurled stones at the car to stop it and poured some inflammable substance before setting it afire. Earlier, Delhi High Court restrained drivers' unions from blocking the cabs.
