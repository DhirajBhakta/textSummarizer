The Pakistani Rangers had reportedly asked the Border Security Force (BSF) to install the 360-foot tall Indian flag away from the Attari border as they fear it could be used for spying purposes. Notably, India has hoisted the tallest tricolour in the country at the Attari border. Pakistan had earlier called it a violation of international treaties.
