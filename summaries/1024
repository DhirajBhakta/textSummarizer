US President Donald Trump has said he signed the anti-Russia sanctions bill, which accuses Russia of meddling in the 2016 US presidential election and punishes the country for its annexation of Crimea, "for the sake of national unity". Calling the bill "seriously flawed", Trump said that it encroaches on his authority to negotiate to strike good deals for the US.
