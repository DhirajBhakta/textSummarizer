Minister of State for Home Affairs Hansraj Ahir said on Wednesday that the government is not considering a separate law to tackle mob lynching incidents, in response to Congress leader Digvijaya Singh's question in the Rajya Sabha. "The state governments can take action against person or persons involved in such incidents under existing laws," he added.
