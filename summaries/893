A mob of around 3,000 people on Wednesday set a police station in Shimla on fire after a rape accused was murdered in police custody. The accused, Suraj Singh, was allegedly murdered by a co-accused in the gangrape following a scuffle. The two suspects fought after Singh reportedly blamed the entire incident on the co-accused.
