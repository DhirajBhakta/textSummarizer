Online payments startup Paytm has denied rumours that the e-wallet will not function after January 15. "Nothing could be farther from the truth. On the contrary, Paytm Wallet users will soon enjoy additional benefits through Paytm Payments Bank Account," said the company in a blog post. Paytm's wallet business will be transferred to the newly incorporated Paytm Payments Bank.
