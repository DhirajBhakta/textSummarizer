After an Indian woman was allegedly strip-searched at Frankfurt airport in Germany, Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj has sought a report from the Indian consul general concerned. The 30-year-old Indian woman, in a Facebook post, wrote that she was asked to strip by security officers as part of 'random security checks'. She alleged that it was a case of racial profiling.
