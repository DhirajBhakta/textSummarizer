Doctors of a medical institute in Jharkhand operated on the right kidney of a patient when the stones were detected in the left one. After the patient's husband pointed out the mistake to the doctors, they assured him of treatment in a private hospital but later asked them to leave. The Urology department's head blamed junior doctors for the mistake.
