Five Delhi traffic policemen have been suspended for allegedly duping truck drivers at Delhi?s border points in the name of the recently implemented Goods and Services Tax (GST). The policemen were reportedly extorting money by asking the truck drivers to prove whether GST has been paid on the goods they were carrying, something they were not authorised to do.
