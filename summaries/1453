The Delhi Traffic Police is reportedly planning to include music therapy as part of its one-day training programme for traffic rule violators. The aim is to make the offenders feel that they are getting some kind of creative satisfaction while being trained, said an officer. A tender will soon be floated for the procurement of music systems.
