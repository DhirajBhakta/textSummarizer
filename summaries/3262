A diamond ring is expected to fetch £350,000 (?3 crore) at an auction in London, 30 years after its owner bought it for £10 (?900), thinking it was a costume jewel. The owners wore the 26.27-carat diamond for decades, only learning its value after a jeweller said it could be valuable. The owners are "incredibly excited," a jeweller said.
