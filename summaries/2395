Uttar Pradesh BJP MLA Brijbhushan Rajput on Wednesday posted a video on Facebook wherein he said, "I will stop Haj yatris from going on their pilgrimage to Mecca if the Muslim community objects to the construction of Ram Mandir in Ayodhya." He further demanded the abolition of Haj subsidy and minority reservations given to the community by the government.
