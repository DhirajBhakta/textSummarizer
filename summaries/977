Security footage from a State Bank of India branch in Pathankot showed a naked man stealing the guard's shoes, two pressure cookers, and a pan, instead of money. He had entered the bank through a hole he dug. The manager said that the CCTV footage showed the man trying to break the locker but failing to do so.
