Union Minister Sushma Swaraj on Saturday said the government will provide assistance in getting Geeta, the deaf and mute Pakistan-returned girl, married to a groom of her choice. Swaraj added that the marriage would be solemnised by Madhya Pradesh CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan. Geeta had accidentally crossed India-Pakistan border and returned in 2015 after spending 13 years in Pakistan.
