The Indian Railways is planning to induct about 40,000 coaches with refurbished interiors and upgraded facilities worth 8,000 crore, to provide world-class comfort to passengers. The coaches will be equipped with strong couplers in order to prevent them from capsizing during accidents. The aim is to make these revamped coaches available by 2023, said a senior Railway Ministry official.
