After the SC on Friday upheld four Nirbhaya gangrape convicts' death penalty, they have been put under 'suicide watch' at Delhi's Tihar jail. Notably, one of the convicts in the case had committed suicide in March 2013, while another one attempted suicide in 2016. The four convicts will now file a review petition in the apex court against the verdict.
