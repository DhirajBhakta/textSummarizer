UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has ordered all party functionaries, MLAs, ministers and government officials to adopt at least one primary school in the state and revamp them within a year. The announcement came as the Yogi government completes its 100 days in power. "Adopting schools personally will get each school adequate attention," said BJP spokesperson Chandra Mohan.
