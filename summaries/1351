Designer Reshma Merchant will showcase a line titled 'The White Rose Collection' which includes garments made with herbs at the Lakmé Fashion Week Summer/Resort 2017. The garments have been created by customising bolts of silk, linen and cotton spun with hand-picked herbs like neem, turmeric and aloe vera. "[W]e are reviving a 2000-year-old craft," said Merchant.
