The Supreme Court on Wednesday ruled that former Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa will not be declared a convict in the disproportionate assets case. The court dismissed Karnataka government's review petition seeking to declare the deceased AIADMK leader a convict and recover a ?100-crore fine by selling her properties. Earlier, the court had convicted AIADMK leader Sasikala in the case.
