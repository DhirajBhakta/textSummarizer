Bajrang Dal in West Bengal and Odisha has warned youth to not celebrate Valentine's Day, stating they would marry off couples who are found venturing into parks, malls or public places. "The boys and girls indulging in indiscriminate obscene acts in the name of celebration is a social crime and is against our Indian culture," a Bajrang Dal activist stated.
