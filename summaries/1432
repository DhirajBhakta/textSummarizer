The Allahabad High Court has stayed the Uttar Pradesh government's order to include 17 sub-castes in the Scheduled Caste category. In December, the UP government had issued an order naming the sub-castes, earlier classified in the Other Backward Classes category, into the SC list. Recently, the HC directed the State to file its reply on a petition challenging the decision.
