The Solapur district cooperative bank told the Bombay HC on Wednesday that they were only able to give ?900 as salary to every teacher for the entire month because the RBI only gave them ?1 crore. The bank claimed that it needs about ?95 crore to pay the salaries of teachers whose accounts are with the bank.
