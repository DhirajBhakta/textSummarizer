After banning maids from entering the society following protests over an allegedly missing maid, Noida's Mahagun Moderne Society has reportedly allowed them to resume work. It was earlier decided that maids who participated in the protest will not be allowed to resume work, but many maids were reportedly hired again after the residents took responsibility for them.
