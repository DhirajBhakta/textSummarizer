Students from Jawaharlal Nehru University staged a protest on Monday against the varsity's alleged decision to restrict 14 students, including JNUSU member Umar Khalid, from registering for the new semester because of their 'activism'. While the protestors claimed that the restriction was against the rules of the university, officials maintained they were within their rights to do so.
