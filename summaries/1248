Delhi government is set to improve facilities on foot-over-bridges and subways for pedestrian convenience, according to reports. The new bridges will have ramps, escalators and even glass-door elevators. The government might also allot space for shops in subways to generate revenue. Apart from revamping, there are also plans of constructing 60 more bridges.
