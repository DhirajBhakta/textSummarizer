A 55-year-old woman named Nirmal Kaur, along with her 32-year-old son Kulwinder Singh, reportedly sacrificed her own grandchildren to free them from 'evil spirits'. While sacrificing the girl and boy, aged five and three, to achieve a degree of tantra, Kaur assured her daughter-in-law that they would come back to life. Kaur and Singh were arrested for practising witchcraft.
