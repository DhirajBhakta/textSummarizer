As part of a campaign to make Amethi open-defecation free, 854 persons in the district have registered themselves as "brothers" with the district committee to gift a lavatory to their sisters on Raksha Bandhan. The registered brothers will build lavatories with their own resources. Later, a lucky draw will be conducted to give up to 50,000 cash to three winners.
