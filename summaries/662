Mumbai's Byculla zoo on Friday celebrated the second birthday of Mr Molt, one of the eight penguins brought from South Korea. Mr Molt was dressed in a red t-shirt and was presented a 'fish-and-ice' cake. After some activists spoke against dressing up the penguin, the zoo authorities clarified that the penguin wore the shirt just "for a few seconds".
