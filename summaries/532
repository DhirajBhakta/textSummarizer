Shiv Sena leader Sunil Shitap was booked for culpable homicide over the collapse of a four-storey building in which 12 people were killed in Mumbai's Ghatkopar on Tuesday. Shitap, who owned the building's ground floor, reportedly carried out illegal renovations that weakened the building. Interestingly, the building wasn't on the Mumbai civic body's list of 791 unsafe buildings this year.
