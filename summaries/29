The Mangrove Society of India has listed Mumbai's two mangrove wetlands Airoli and Vikhroli, among twelve unique mangrove forests in India. The twelve locations were selected to help conserve different mangrove species, and establish them as international tourism destinations, officials said. "Mangrove forests can sequester carbon 10 times more than tropical forests," they added.
