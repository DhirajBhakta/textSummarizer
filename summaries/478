The National Investigation Agency has arrested Hurriyat leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani's son-in-law Altaf Shah and six other Kashmiri separatists in a probe linked to terrorist funding. The agency is probing if funds from Pakistan were used to fuel the unrest triggered by terrorist Burhan Wani's death last year that left 100 people dead in the Kashmir Valley.
