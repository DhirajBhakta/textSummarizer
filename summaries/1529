The Shanghai Maritime Court in China has sold a seized foreign ship for $2.41 million (16 crore) at an online auction through Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba. The Panamanian-flagged Mahoni was seized in May after crew members filed a lawsuit claiming its owner had not been paying them. The auction attracted over 12,000 viewers and went through 63 rounds of offers.
