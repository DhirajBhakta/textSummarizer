Taxi-hailing startup Ola posted a loss of ?2,311 crore for fiscal 2015-16, which is about three times compared to the year before. The loss was reportedly on account of employee-related expenses rising over five-fold. However, despite the increase in absolute amount of loss, the Softbank-backed startup Ola reduced its loss margin, said research and analytics firm Tofler.
