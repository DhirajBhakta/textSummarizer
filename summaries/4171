Real estate baron Gopal Ansal on Monday surrendered before Tihar jail authorities to face one-year jail term in the 1997 Uphaar fire tragedy case. This comes after the Supreme Court rejected his plea seeking more time to surrender. Notably, 59 persons had died in Uphaar Cinema in Delhi during the screening of Hindi movie 'Border' on June 13, 1997.
