US President Donald Trump on Wednesday said that the Islamic State was "on the run" and will soon be "wiped out" of Syria and Iraq. Trump's statement comes after Iraqi forces declared victory over the militant group in Mosul, retaking full control of the country's second-largest city three years after it was seized.
