Chinese media has urged India to take steps to enable a former Chinese soldier, residing in Madhya Pradesh after being imprisoned post the 1962 war, to return to China to visit his family. The story of Wang Qi, a Chinese army surveyor who strayed into India in January 1963 and subsequently imprisoned until 1969, was recently reported by the BBC.
