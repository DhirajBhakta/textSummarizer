A Pikachu-themed train has been introduced in Japan's Ichinoseki Metro Station for sightseeing, which will begin its daily service from July 15. It was designed as part of the 'Pokemon with You' campaign organised by the Pokemon Company following the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami. The train is intended to cheer up children and adults living in the area.
