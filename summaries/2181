A family in Mumbai has planted around 5,500 saplings in Aarey Milk Colony over the last 17 years. The initiative was started by Vinay Athalye, in 2000. Over the years he planted about 3,500 saplings, which have now turned into a dense forest with 75 varieties of trees. After his death, his family has been continuing the initiative.
