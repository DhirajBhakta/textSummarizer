Surinder Koli, the prime accused in the Nithari killing cases, was awarded the death penalty in the seventh case by a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) court in Ghaziabad on Friday. Koli was awarded death sentence by the CBI court in all the previous six cases but one of them was later commuted to life by the Allahabad High Court.
