India on Thursday snubbed China's offer to play a "constructive role" in resolving the Kashmir issue, saying the issue is a bilateral matter with Pakistan and there is no scope of any third-party mediation. The offer from the neighbour has come at a time when the armies of India and China are locked in a standoff in the Sikkim area.
