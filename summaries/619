Donald Trump is the first US President without a pet in the White House in nearly 150 years, in break with a long-held tradition of presidential pet ownership. The last pet-less US leader was Andrew Johnson who was impeached in 1868. US Presidents have owned conventional pets like cats and dogs, and also exotic animals like bears and tigers.n
