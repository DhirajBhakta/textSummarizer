A young couple from Wales has made their children quit school and sold most of their possessions to travel the world. Clare and Ian Fisher said, "There's no limit on how long we go for," while planning their trip starting with Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Malaysia, and Indonesia. Meanwhile, they will teach their children using an online school every day.
