The New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) has failed to rename Teen Murti Marg after Israeli city 'Haifa' before Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to the Jewish nation. "No final call has been taken on the proposal yet...We are not sure whether it will be scrapped totally or reconsidered later," NDMC Vice Chairman Karan Singh Tanwar said.
