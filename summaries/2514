After a mob pelted stones at Mahagun Moderne Society in Noida Sector 78 for alleged beating of a maid, the residents have decided not to allow Bangladeshi maids in the premises. "Every individual in the society is scared after Wednesdays incident. There is no way they can trust the Bangladeshi domestic helps anymore," said a resident.
