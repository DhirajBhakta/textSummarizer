Uttar Pradesh Power Minister Shrikant Sharma on Sunday launched free power connection schemes for BPL families at 624 places across the state. Sharma said that the scheme would also benefit those without BPL cards at present by charging ?80-?120 from them to provide the power connection. The scheme would provide relief to middle-class families with instalment payment facility, he added.
