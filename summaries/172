The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram has put up 'free parking' signboards at entry points of several malls on MG Road. The authority had earlier waived off property tax for malls on the condition that they provide free basement parking. The decision to place the signboards comes after the MCG received complaints that the malls were continuing to charge for parking.
