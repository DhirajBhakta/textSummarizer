The dead body of a 28-year-old missing West Bengal woman has been recovered from a concrete tomb inside a home in Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh. The woman was allegedly killed by her live-in partner, a 32-year-old man named Udyan Das who claims to be an ex-IITian. The two had met each other on Facebook around eight months ago, the police said.
