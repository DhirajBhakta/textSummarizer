The Bombay High Court today was informed by the Maharashtra government pleader that it cannot find the notification classifying roads as state highways and other roads. 
The reason Maharashtra government is looking for this notification is because a bunch of petitions have been filed by liquor vendors and restaurant owners claiming that the excise department is now not renewing their licenses to sell or serve liquor as the department claims they are located on the highways.It was in December last year that the Supreme Court in its landmark judgment of State of Tamil Nadu V/s. 
Balu and others had directed for not issuing license to liquor shops and permit rooms within distance of 500 mtrs form the national and state highways.? By the said judgment the apex court had also directed for not renewing license of existing shops and for not issuing new license for such shops after 31st March, 2017 along national and state highways. 
Advocate Shrikrishna Ganbavale who is appearing for the petitioners explained, "There has to be a notification from state government that this road or that road is a national highway or a state highway. 
The court has granted the state government time till Monday to get these notifications and has even asked the advocate general of Maharashtra to appear before them.
