Houston, Feb 12 (PTI) A quick-thinking golfer in the US hit life-saving shots with his putter when he used the club to save himself from the clutches of a 10-foot alligator. 
"As I was walking about 5 to 6 feet away from the water I heard a splash, and as soon as I heard that splash I knew it was an alligator, and he got me," Aarts was quoted as saying by WINK News. 
"I remember having a club in my hand, and as soon as he had me in the water up to my waist, I started hitting him over the head," Aarts said. 
However, Aarts then went for the reptiles eye socket with his club which finally saved him.
