popular vote is much easier.So I have to tell you, what we did, in all fairness, is an unbelievable tribute to you and all of the other millions and millions of people that came out and voted for Make America Great Again.And by the way, under the Trump administration, you?
So they called William Levitt up and they said, would you like to buy back your company and he said yes, I would. 
He went personally bankrupt, and he was now much older.And I saw him at a cocktail party and it was very sad. 
And I was doing well so I got invited to the party.
