The Opposition Congress today asked Amitabh Bachchan to refrain from promoting the Goods and Services Tax (GST) or face protest from the party. 
The superstar responded by saying he is doing it because he was asked.Mumbai Congress leader Sanjay Nirupam has asked the 74-year-old Bollywood superstar to stop promoting GST, a uniform tax regime set to be launched on July 1."
A 40-second video featuring Bachchan has also been released by the government, in which the actor explains GST as a "unifying force, just like the three colours in the national flag". 
GST will simplify a web of taxes, regulations and border levies by subsuming an array of central and state levies including excise duty, service tax and VAT. 
The GST Council, that brings together the central and state governments, has met 17 times to thrash out how the tax will work.
