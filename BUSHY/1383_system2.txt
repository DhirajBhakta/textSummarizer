Car connoisseurs in Delhi have been given a reason to rejoice by the National Green Tribunal, who on Friday made an exception to the ban on vehicles older than 15 years on Delhi roads and gave permission to the 21 Gun Salute Heritage and Cultural Trust to conduct their International Vintage Car Rally in February.?
Now that they have been granted permission by the NGT bench, the seventh edition of the vintage car rally will be held in Delhi-NCR in the third week of February.The fifth and sixth editions of the rally had also taken place after getting exemptions and permissions approved by the tribunal. ?
The latest order came in the wake of a plea filed by the organisers of the car show, who argued that they hold the event to raise funds for spastic children.
