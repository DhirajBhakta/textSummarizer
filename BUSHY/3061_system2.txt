Beijing, Jun 9 (PTI) Fossils of a completely preserved crocodile and bones belonging to at least six different dinosaurs, dating back 145 to 66 million years, have been unearthed in northeast China. 
Paleontologists from Chinese Academy of Sciences began the excavation in late May, following the discovery of dinosaur fossils last year at Longshan Mountain in the city of Yanji in Jilin Province. 
A 1.5-meter-long crocodile fossil was found on June 1, researchers said. 
"Crocodiles and dinosaurs lived together, which means there are probably more fossils buried underneath," said Jin Changzhu, a research fellow at the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology.
