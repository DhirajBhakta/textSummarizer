Mumbai, May 27 (PTI) Filmmaker Ram Gopal Varma says contrary to the popular perception, underworld never invested money into Bollywood and there was never really a "nexus" between them. 
Varma says the activities of underworld with regard to Bollywood were mostly limited to making calls to either scare celebrities or help their friends. 
If underworld also has to put money, why is it underworld? 
But the underworld at that time was in the mood of being in the news. 
The filmmaker was speaking at a special event where he unveiled the teaser of his upcoming web series "Guns and Thighs", which chronicles the rise and fall of the Mumbai underworld. 
The director, known for making several gangster-dramas like "Satya", "Company" and "D", says he has never been at the receiving end of the underworld because of his films. 
Why would the underworld have any problem with anyone making a film."
