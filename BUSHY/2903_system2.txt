Director Kabir Khan is all geared up for his big Eid release Tubelight which stars superstar Salman Khan in the lead role. 
However, the celebration of the brotherhood of the Khan brothers is one of the selling points of the film.Tubelight is the Bollywood debut film of Chinese actor Zhu Zhu. 
Recently, there have been rumours that before Zhu Zhu was cast for the role, Deepika Padukone was the director's first choice for the character. 
However, Deepika apparently rejected the role because it was not interesting enough.In an interview with BollywoodLife, Kabir Khan quashed all rumours by saying that Deepika was never a part of Tubelight. 
I have never considered Deepika to play a Chinese character. 
the Ek Tha Tiger director added.In the interview, the director also talked about another upcoming film which was rejected by Salman Khan because he felt suffocated by the prosthetics that his character required.Tubelight, which will also see Shah Rukh Khan in a cameo, is the story of two brothers set against the backdrop of the 1962 Sino-Indian war.
