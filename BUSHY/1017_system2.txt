The 32-year-old overcame the disability with a never-say-die attitude, and on Monday gave Indians a sporting moment to cherish.The 32-year-old clinched silver medal in the club throw event in the F-51 category --- below waist paraplegic category --- at the ongoing World Para Athletics Championships in London. 
I was expecting a medal in the Rio Games, but somehow missed it by a few centimetres. 
For the last nine months, I was eagerly waiting for the world championships to make up for my Rio loss. 
This is my second medal in the world championships, but this one is special as I was able to increase my distance by around five metres from the 2015 edition, where too I got silver,? 
In Bangalore I got to know about para sports. 
By the grace of god, I am financially well off and what I have earned, be it money or recognition, is all because of para sports.
