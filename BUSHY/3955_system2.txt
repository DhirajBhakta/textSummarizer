Hyderabad, Apr 3 (PTI) Backing Infosys co-founder N R Narayana Murthys view on pay hike to COO U B Pravin Rao being "not proper," companys ex-director T V Mohandas Pai today said the salary in this case is "spectacular" but performance is not. 
Alleging that Infosys board was "misguided", Pai said the ""fundamental problem" was the pay hike given earlier to CEO Vishal Sikka "without any justification", because of which other executives were also expecting higher pay. 
"The starting salary for software engineers has not gone up for the past seven years; and the inflation in the last seven years is about 60 per cent," he said. 
"I think unless people at the bottom (software engineers) get good, regular hike, paying people at the top for doing nothing...for long period of time is totally wrong," Pai said. 
"The fundamental error was increasing CEOs salary from USD 7 million to 11 million without any justification," Pai further said.
