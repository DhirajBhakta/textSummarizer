When singer-actor Suchitra leaked a private photo of actors Rana Daggubati and Trisha Krishnan having an intimate moment, netizens went into a tizzy. 
At the book launch of The Rise Of Sivagami, a prequel to the epic saga Baahubali, Rana was asked about his response to the whole SuchiLeaks controversy.The actor replies, "You think I really give a sh*t?" 
He later told IndiaToday.in exclusively, "It's you guys (the media) who made a big deal out of it, but I really don't give a sh*t. 
(laughs) I actually made a big joke out of it at the IIFA Utsavam, when I was hosting it."
