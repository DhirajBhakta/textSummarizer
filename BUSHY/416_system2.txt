When I began singing, I didn?
I had no time to think of anything except how to look after my siblings. 
The only thing I could do was sing. 
I think in 1949, I sang around 100-120 songs. 
In 1949, I had 40-50 chartbusters, including Hawaa mein udta jaye, Jiya beqaraar hai (Barsaat); Aayega aanewala (Mahal); Lara lapaa (Ek Thi Ladki); Chup chup khade ho (Badi Bahen); and Sajan ki galiyan chhod chale (Lahore).?
But I never thought of my voice as being bigger than the film. 
I sang my songs keeping the heroine?
In fact, for many years, I desisted from doing live concerts.?
