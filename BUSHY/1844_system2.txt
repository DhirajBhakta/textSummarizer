The government has allowed us 42 squadrons. 
We have enough heavy fighters (like Sukhoi) but we need more in the medium segment.Worst moment: It came when I heard about the An32 missing with 29 personnel. 
However, an ex IAF chief is like a family member to us and till a person is convicted, let us give him his due. 
Unless there is something being done which is prohibited like nuclear proliferation which is also happening by the way in our neighbourhood, if we are legitimately developing our capability, I do not think anybody should object.On air to air refueling planes of the IAF: The aircraft we have for the job are not very good on serviceability. 
We are also helping BSF, ARC, paramilitary forces and anti-Maoist operations.OROP: The agitation was a setback.
