Two people were killed when a light plane made an emergency landing on a beach near Lisbon, Portuguese authorities have said.The two sunbathers, a 56-year-old man and an eight-year-old girl, died while others ran into the sea when the plane came down on Wednesday.Hundreds of sunbathers were on the popular S?o Jo?o da Caparica beach, 12 miles (20km) to the south of Lisbon, at the time. 
Enrique Coelho, who was playing with his son at the beach and saw the plane crash, told local media.The victims were hit by the plane, the commander of the port of Lisbon, Jose Isabel, confirmed.The two occupants of the plane were unhurt and were being questioned by officers from Portugal?
The small aircraft, a Cessna, appeared to be in difficulty and wobbled as it skimmed low over the sunbathers, scattering them and spreading panic on the beach, witnesses said.The plane appeared to have a partly broken left wing, which hung lower than the right wing, according to Portuguese TV pictures. 
Local reports said the aircraft was registered to a flying school in Torres Vedras.The Portuguese newspaper Di?rio de Not?cias reported that the Aerocondor aviation school in Cascais had confirmed the aircraft ? 
Some sunbathers said the plane appeared to be gliding, as they heard no engine noise.? 
An earlier version said S?o Jo?o da Caparica beach was 20 miles south of Lisbon.
