The drive, however, turned out to be one filled with horror and one that made Bharti fear for his and his family's life after a large group of people he identified as Bajrang Dal activists accosted them and made Bharti chant 'Jai Shri Ram'. 
On June 28, Bharti and his family were on their way to Rahimbad, a village in Bihar's Samastipur district located around 75 kilometers north east of capital Patna. 
Bharti says he and family joined the line of trucks that had been halted by people who seemed to Bajrang Dal activists. 
"As they neared my car, I asked them what the commotion was about," Bharti says. 
In response, Bharti says, a few of the alleged Bajrang Dal men looked inside his car and noticed his father, who had a beard, and his wife, who was wearing a nikab. 
"On seeing this, their sloganeering intensified, and before I could understand what was going on, two people shoved their heads into the car through the windows and said, 'Chant Jai Shri Ram or we will set your car on fire', sending me in shock," Bharti recounts in his Facebook post. 
Having followed the men's commands, Bharti and his family quickly escape from the location, taking another route to Rahimbad. 
After driving for a few minutes, Bharti stopped and tweeted to Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar recounting his ordeal in a short sentence.
