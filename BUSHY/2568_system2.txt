Uttarakhand may be one of the smaller states in India, but that hardly matters as far as the disgruntlement quotient of its residents is concerned.A report released by the Bureau of Police Research and Development shows that the state witnessed as many as 21,966 protests in 2016, topping national charts and leaving many giants such as Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra behind. 
In utter contrast, the northeastern state of Nagaland figured at the bottom with just one protest through 2016.Social activist Anoop Nautiyal admitted that Uttarakhand witnesses a large number of protests every year, most of which arise from factors such as administrative apathy, civic problems and unemployment. ?
