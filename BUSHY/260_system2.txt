Actor Emraan Hashmi has been in the Hindi film industry for almost 14 years, but the one film which he considers a career-changer was Once Upon A Time In Mumbaai (2010). 
I had worked with Kangana before this film, and Prachi and Randeep were amazing too. 
Ajay Devgn played the role of Sultan Mirza, while Emraan Hashmi was his nemesis ShoaibEmraan played the role of the rebellious Shoaib based on a real-life underworld don. 
His character locks horns with the smuggling overlord of Mumbai, Sultan Mirza, played by Ajay Devgn. 
Before this, there had been landmark gangster films like Vaastav (1999), Company (2002) and Satya (1998), and I myself had rejected a lot of films based on the underworld?
