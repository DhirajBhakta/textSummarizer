If you think the concept of period-shaming isn't as rampant as it was a few years ago, then please allow us to help you snap out of your oblivious bubble.Model Rachel Rickert, 27, has decided to sue automobile giant, Hyundai, for "shaming" and firing her for being on her period. 
On informing her talent representative, Erika Seifred, about the situation and asking for a change of clothes and some time to freshen up, Rachel was--against her will--soon asked to go home and cater to her "period situation."
As per her federal discrimination complaint filed at the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Rachel mentioned that she received a call by Seifred on April 15 informing her about being fired by Hyundai because they "heard about Ms Rickert having her menstrual cycle and they didn't want Ms Rickert representing the company anymore," New York Post reports.
