New Delhi, Jul 4 (PTI) Producer Ekta Kapoor has said she came up with a "sassy promo" for "Lipstick Under My Burkha" as she wanted the film to reach out to wider audiences rather than being confined to the art film zone. 
I saw the film and realised we really live in a world where as women we are not allowed to do or say anything. 
"I thought, will this be an artie movie that 200 people will watch or a film where Ill get more and more women to see it? 
I read somewhere there is nothing that a right shade of lipstick cant fix. 
Spilling details about the first scene of the film, Ekta said one of the characters goes to a shop and steals a lipstick.
