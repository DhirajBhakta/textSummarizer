England pace spearhead James Anderson, who is one of the senior members of the national team, has admitted he was a bit disappointed after he was overlooked for the role of Test captain following Alastair Cook's decision to step down from the post.Cook had earlier this year stepped down as England's Test captain after a record 59 matches in charge. 
I don't know how long I'm going to keep going for and in the grand scheme of things it makes sense for a younger guy to do it," he added.Anderson, who is a veteran of 122 Tests and England's all-time leading wicket-taker, pointed out that most of the fast bowling captains he had known have been pretty successful and was thus surprised why more fast bowlers aren't given the opportunity to do it."
