Busy promoting his forthcoming release Velaiilla Pattadhari (VIP 2) across the length and breadth of the country, he has also wrapped up work on his maiden Hollywood film The Extraordinary Journey of the Fakir. 
I just finished one English film and I believe a script should convince me to take off from one industry to another and do complete justice to it. 
VIP Official (@VIPoffl) July 19, 2017Talking about his English film, directed by Ken Scott and based on the bestselling novel, he said, ?
I have earlier said no to three-four English films but this film made me say ?
I will be co-producing Hollywood films very soon.

They are watching our films, they are hiring Indian stars and they like our song-and-dance format.
