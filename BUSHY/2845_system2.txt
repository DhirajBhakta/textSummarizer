Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) president Sharad Pawar said that he expected the BJP-led NDA to field "someone like L K Advani or Murli Manohar Joshi" for the July 17 presidential election.Speaking in Pune, Pawar said Meira Kumar was the "best pick" by the opposition. 
Asked about NDA's candidate Ram Nath Kovind, Pawar said it was an "internal matter" of the ruling coalition and he can't comment on it but Pawar added that he was expecting someone like Lal Krishna Advani to be their candidate as he was the deputy prime minister and has immense experience of governance. 
"DEMONETISATION HARDLY BENEFITTED ANYONE"Also at the conference, Sharad Pawar hit out at the BJP government over demonetisation and said that he is sure that the step that BJP government took on November 8, 2016 hardly benefited anyone. 
Around Rs 2,000 crore is still lying in these banks and it won't be exchanged by The Reserve Bank of India unless, a notification is issued by the Union Government under the Specified Bank Note Liability Act 2017.FARM LOAN WAIVERSharad Pawar appreciated the approach of Devendra Fadnavis and his government towards debt ridden farmers but said this won't put an end to every problem. 
Pawar said that the government should work on giving Minimum Support Price (MSP) to farmers and also implement the recommendations by Swaminathan Committee which enhances the profitability in agriculture, "by ensuring a minimum of 50 per cent profits over the cost of production."
