The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG), which earlier waived off property tax for several malls on the condition of providing free basement parking to city residents, has decided to put up ?
signboards at entry points of malls on MG Road.The move has come after MCG received complaints that malls continued to charge visitors for parking despite their commitment to provide the service for free.V Umashankar, MCG commissioner, said, ?
In case people find mall managements violating the free parking commitments, they can lodge complaints instantly. 
said Umashankar, adding that he is working on a plan to improve the Mall Mile at MG Road.Earlier, in March, the MCG had decided not to levy property tax on commercial spaces of malls and other office establishments if they provided free parking in their basements.Prominent among these establishments are DLF City Court shopping centre-cum-office, Grand Mall, Mega City Mall, Vipul Agora Mall and Solitaire Plaza Hotel on MG Road. 
We wish every commercial establishment, including malls, used its basements for free parking.
