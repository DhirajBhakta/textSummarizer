Union minister Kiren Rijiju has accused Left parties of misleading people amid the raging controversy over Delhi University student Gurmehar Kaur's social media posts . 
Kaur, daughter of Captain Mandeep Singh who was martyred in a terrorist attack in Jammu and Kashmir in 1999, is at the centre of a huge row which erupted after her posts on social media against the violence which took place at DU's Ramjas College last week."
Kaur had actually posted the video in May last year advocating India-Pakistan peace and it was reposted after February 22 violence in Ramjas College as part of protest against BJP-backed Akhil Bhartiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP). 
The students held posters with messages like "Your nationalism is not above our democracy".The protesters, mainly comprising students of left forums like AISA, shouted slogans "ABVP Go Back" and "Azaadi" as the march made its way through the roads of North Campus towards the Arts Faculty building.The gates of the colleges falling on the route of the march, which began from the gates of Khalsa College, were shut."
