t partner anymore, the Kolkata franchise of the Indian Super League (ISL) will continue to be known as ATK, said its principal owner Sanjiv Goenka.And would ATK continue to stand for what is was over the past three years? 
Translated from Bengali, that would mean the team for every Kolkatan.Speaking after the media conference where Goenka said this, a team official said it is premature to say that henceforth ATK would stand for something apart from what was coined three years ago after the La Liga giants came on board with a 25% stake in the ownership.?
Goenka said even though the I-League and the ISL would be held simultaneously this season, there is no competition between ATK and Mohun Bagan and East Bengal in terms of garnering support. ?
