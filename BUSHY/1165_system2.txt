Lucknow, Feb 14 (PTI) The NDA government has "not waived even a single paisa" of any industrialist and Rahul Gandhi is levelling "false allegations" in this regard, Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley asserted today. 
"Actually, he is levelling false allegations against the previous UPA government as most of the non-performing assets today belong to those who had been given loans by the Congress-led government," he claimed. 
To another question, Jaitley said, "Demonetisation has nothing to do with Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections... it is a part of the governments programme to clean up both economic and political systems." 
On the SP-led Uttar Pradesh governments allegation of lack of enough Central help, he said, "This is totally wrong." 
"Under the constitutional provisions, the Centre cannot cut even a single rupee in allocation to the state... 42 per cent of the revenue collected by the Central government belongs to the state and there is no scope of cutting even a single rupee," he said.
