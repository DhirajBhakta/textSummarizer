Former gang member and event organiser Tokomauri Hoterene said a spate of gang killings in Northland on the North Island in 2016 had brought gang tensions in his region to new highs. 
There are ten different gangs in Northland and Hoterene said 80% of the violence is related to disputes over drugs. 
Hoterene and his fellow organisers hope some of the lingering anger can be punched out in the boxing ring, but its been a challenge to get venues and some members of the community on board. ?
The president of the New Zealand chapter of the Mongrel Mob known as Smashdog told Maori Television it was about time gangs started addressing their differences. ?
