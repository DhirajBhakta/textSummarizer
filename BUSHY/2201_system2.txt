Producer and CBFC chairperson Pahlaj Nihalani is not a fan of the International Indian Films Academy (IIFA) awards. 
Nihalani says many actors who were taken to New York did not even attend? 
IIFA is selling Indian cinema to various countries and probably getting many financial benefits. 
I think the day Mr Bachchan opted out, IIFA lost its dignity and relevance. 
In 18 years, how much global impact has Indian cinema made and what hand did IIFA have in this??  
Nihalani has also challenged IIFA?
s claim of representing Indian cinema abroad. 
So why do they call themselves the International Indian films awards? 
Bollywood is not Indian cinema.?
