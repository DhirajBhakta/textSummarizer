He also had heard of the flamboyant batsman in the domestic circuit in Delhi and knew immediately that a special talent was in the making. 
Sehwag knows the India captain in and out and now has some interesting tales to tell about Kohli.Until Kohli became the captain of the Indian Test team, he was infamous for his brash and aggressive attitude and had quite a few run-ins with opposition players on the field. 
Even now in his career as a broadcaster, Sehwag is hilarious with his commentary and doesn't like to mince his words.Sehwag, in a recent show with Star Sports, narrated a particular story about Kohli where he revealed how he used to behave like a shy youngster in front of the seniors but was the complete opposite during his U-19 days."
He was a shy and quite youngster in front of us senior players but when he was in the U-19 team he used to be very very naughty. 
He played the next match and smashed a double hundred," Sehwag told Star Sports in an interview.Sehwag also recalled the time he heard about Kohli for the first time and what he thought of the future India captain the first time he saw him bat live.
