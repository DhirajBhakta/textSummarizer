London, Jan 19 (PTI) The head of a website has been dubbed Britains best boss after he splurged a whopping three million pounds to create a dream castle office for his employees complete with a Star Wars-themed cinema, gaming arcade, yoga studio along with an "ice cave" for meetings. 
Morling envisioned this style of workplace to keep his 50-strong staff "entertained and engaged" and to help attract the creme de la creme of the industry, The Sun reported. 
Based in a Victorian castle on the Bathurst Estate, other on-site luxuries include a weights gym, yoga studio and staff also enjoy free weekly sport matches -- which the boss himself gets involved in. 
And if employees are feeling hungry, there is free breakfast in the kitchen, complete with a pinball machine, PS4, pool table and football table.
