A woman fell 60 feet from one of the US tallest bridges while taking a selfie but miraculously survived after landing on a trail below. 
The Sacramento-area woman was expected to survive after she fell 60 feet off the restricted area of the Foresthill Bridge near Auburn, California, while trying to take a selfie, the Placer County Sheriffs Office said. 
Goncharuk also confirmed that "they were taking a picture on the bridge, and then the big bolts that are holding the beams together, she stepped on them kind of weirdly and lost balance and fell backwards." 
The woman, whose identity has not been revealed, and a group of her friends were walking on the catwalk underneath the bridge when she tried to take a selfie and fell 60 feet onto a trail below, the sheriffs office said. 
Police have started patrolling the area after a series of pictures and videos of people dangling from walkways under the bridge.
