 The Noida authority has decided to paint road marks with an aim to streamline traffic movement on city roads.  
s traffic cell found out that 80% of road markings in the city are either washed away or fade out on their own. 
Once the road and lane marks are in place, they will help the traffic police in regulating the flow of traffic,? 
The project involves marking of zebra crossings, left-right turns, stop lines for vehicles and designated spaces for pedestrians, who often face problems negotiating traffic without adequate markings on roads. 
But we need to have proper road markings before we start penalising motorists caught violating traffic norms. 
Layak Singh, traffic inspector, Noida traffic police, said. 
There are 112 traffic signals in Noida and the traffic police has 278 personnel at its disposal to regulate the movement of vehicles.The traffic police wants to make use of CCTVs to impose penalty on motorists violating traffic norms. 
The Noida authority and the traffic police have, of late, been struggling to ensure smooth flow of traffic in busy thoroughfares. ?
Whenever the traffic police writes to us for support on traffic management, we provide them the facilities required. 
We hope to finish the road marking work very soon in order to enable the traffic police to penalise violators,?
