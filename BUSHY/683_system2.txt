And except for seven depots under five zonal railways, linens had not been sanitised in the other selected depots, the CAG has said.During 2015-2016, in respect of 12 coaching depots of eight zonal railways, blankets had been washed after an interval of 6-26 months, the report stated.These depots included Lokmanya Tilak Terminus (Mumbai), Sealdah (Kolkata), Gwalior, Guwahati, Dibrugarh, Lucknow, Secunderabad, and Hatia and Tatanagar (in Jharkhand).The report also said there were general stores depots which stored fresh linens along with those that were to be discarded. 
At the Basin Bridge depot in Chennai, pillow covers were being stitched from the used bedsheets to tide over shortages.In a few cases, in the Northern Railway, used pillow covers were provided to the passengers, the report said.The audit report said there was a need for the railways to increase the pace of setting up of mechanised laundries and prescribe norms for quality standards for washed linen.?
Proper storage space may be provided for storage of linen in store depots, so that linen can be issued in an organised manner,? 
At the store in Kharagpur, face towels were kept in a room with broken windows susceptible to damage due to seepage of rainwater.In some zonal railways, new stock remained unutilised almost all their life span.In North Eastern Railway, the audit said, the stock at the depots had already completed two-to-seven months life from the date of manufacture before it was received at the Gorakhpur depot.In the South Eastern Railway, bedsheets (life cycle of 12 months) and pillow covers (life cycle of nine months) remained unutilised for seven months and similarly face towels (life cycle of nine months) remained unutilised for five months at the depots.?
