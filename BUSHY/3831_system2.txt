In an exclusive interview with India Today's Koel Purie, Shah Rukh Khan spoke about his still-in-progress book, dreams, acting and his children, AbRam, Suhana and Aryan.When asked why his book, which SRK once called '20 Years of a Decade' is still not out in stores yet, Shah Rukh said, "I am still writing it. 
An example of finding pleasure in small things, according to Shah Rukh Khan was when the actor made a house out of Lego with his son AbRam.On the topic of his daughter Suhana joining Bollywood as an actor, Shah Rukh said, "You need to be minimal qualification of a graduate before you even think of coming and learning any way. 
(sic)""If she gets into the field that I already am in, somewhere, even without wanting, even though I would like to avoid it, the life lessons will permeate on to her through me. 
I'm not saying go beyond me and learn and come back and all only, I don't think she needs this kind of a shadow over her. 
When you go to a school, when you go to a college; failure, and passing, bad treatment, good treatment, happy days, bad days, sad days that happen in a school and college are, I think, really important life lessons.
