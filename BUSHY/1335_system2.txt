In order to make good some of this revenue loss on account of this relief, I propose to levy a surcharge of 10% of tax payable on categories of individuals whose annual taxable income is between Rs 50 lakhs and Rs 1 crore.? The existing surcharge of 15% of Tax on people earning more than Rs 1 crore will continue.? This is likely to give additional revenue of Rs 2,700 crores. 176.? In order to expand tax net, I also plan to have a simple one-page form to be filed as Income Tax Return for the category of individuals having taxable income upto Rs 5 lakhs other than business income.? Also a person of this category who files income tax return for the first time would not be subjected to any scrutiny in the first year unless there is specific information available with the Department regarding his high value transaction.? I appeal to all citizens of India to contribute to Nation Building by making a small payment of 5% tax if their income is falling in the lowest slab of Rs 2.5 lakhs to Rs 5 lakhs.177.? Some other important proposals for amendment in Tax Laws which are not covered by me in my speech are given in Annex III of this speech.? Goods and Services Tax178.? There has been substantial progress towards ushering in GST, by far, the biggest tax reform since independence.
