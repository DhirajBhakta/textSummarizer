A woman had to give birth in the absence of a doctor in a government hospital in Bundi, and the male nurse who assisted her during the delivery told her that her child was dead and should be taken to the burial ground. 
Following the male nurse's advice, the family took the new born for the burial. 
He in fact did not even try saving the newborn's life.Residents of Bundi district are appalled by this incident of negligence and questioned the hospital authorities that if the infant had not cried before the burial then because of the wrong information given to them, the family would have buried her alive.
