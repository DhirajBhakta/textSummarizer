When criticised for his tweets, Ramu said that his tweets were meant to be appreciative of Jackie and that his wife (and Tiger's mom) Ayesha shouldn't be taking his tweets to heart.Recently, at an event, when Jackie Shroff was asked to comment on Ramu's rather harsh words about his son, the veteran actor said, "He spoke about my son but that doesn't mean I will go and fight with him."
Calling Ram Gopal Varma a 'big boy', Jackie said, "He is a big boy. 
He was quoted as saying, "I am not even half the man that my father is. 
He is a senior director, so, there's not much I can say to him."
