Which event (sport) has so many World Champions," said the former Indian team director on Monday. 
(Rs 2 crore is peanuts: Ravi Shastri wants steep pay hike for Indian cricketers)Shastri, who spoke to reporters on the sidelines of a promotional event of "Greycells Education", in which he is a mentor and advisor, felt that the quadrennial ICC World Cup gets diluted by the existence of the Champions Trophy."
I go and meet anyone on the street and am asked 'kitna World Cup hai yaar' (how many World Cups are there), 'World Champion hai kaun' (who is the World Champion), which is a fact. 
You have both the Champions Trophy and the World Cup.
