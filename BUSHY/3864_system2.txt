The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) is set to launch its housing scheme in May this year. 
DMRC is building 2BHK and 3BHK flats in the city?
Brochures will be released next month with an application form to book a flat, which DMRC promises to deliver by 2019. ?
We will construct 460 flats in Janakpuri and 90 in Okhla. 
The flats will be allotted on the basis of a draw and people can apply as soon as we open the scheme. 
The flats will be delivered within two years,? 
He further said that 15% of the total flats will be reserved for the economically weaker section. 
This is the first time that DMRC is constructing flats for public. 
The price of the flats will not be altered.
