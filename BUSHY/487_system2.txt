Bollywood editor and writer Apurva Asrani, best known for his films with Hansal Mehta (Aligarh, Shahid),  has written a poem on the mob culture. 
India has recently witnessed a host of public lynchings.Asrani wrote the poem on his Facebook wall last week and it is being shared across the platform ever since. 
In the strongly worded poem, Asrani points out the lack of rationale in our current scenario with hashtags and click-baity headlines holding the sway. 
Here is the entire text of the poem: We are the mob and the mob is us.Left-wing, right-wing or in the centre, what difference does it make?
And if it endures, persists and kicks back, Of a new hashtag it may be found able.The stray thought will then be co-opted,A following of its own it will make.And when it starts to believe its own legend,fast fingers will claw at its facade.After all, we are the mob and the mob is us.Apurva was recently in news when he got into a row with Kangana Ranaut over the writing credits of Hansal Mehta?
, Kangana claimed to have effectively written the entire film.Follow @htshowbiz for more
