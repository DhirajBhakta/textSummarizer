Congress needs to think whether it wants to take fringe position or mainstream position on issues of national interests," Jaitley said.MIDNIGHT SESSIONArun Jaitley rejected the Opposition's claim that the midnight session of Parliament for GST launch was a 'self-promotion' move by the Modi government."
The July 1 deadline was fixed at the GST Council, which took a unanimous decision on implementing GST, said Jaitley.Jaitley said that previously traders had to file return for 17 different taxes. 
"Under GST, they are required to file one tax in one software every month," Jaitley said.He said there would be some glitches as GST was a new regime but the those would be appropriately dealt with.WHAT ELSE JAITLEY SAIDArun Jaitley emphasised that Centre was not deciding authority in finalising tax rates. 
Some people are saying that GST will lead to more integration with the rest of the country.Jaitley said that he has written a letter to Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti highlighting the losses that Jammu and Kashmir and people of the state will suffer for not implementing GST.Jammu and Kashmir consumers will have to pay taxes twice. 
He said, all the states and political parties should take one clear stand on GST. 
The decision will be taken sooner than later, Jaitley said.On real estate, Jailtey said, this sector will also be brought under the GST.
