he said.The decision came after a feasibility study was done to identify a suitable stretch of the river for navigation and development of water transport facilities. 
After this, Delhi water minister Kapil Mishra along with the officials of IWAI, irrigation and flood control department and Delhi Jal Board (DJB), conducted a site inspection in July 2016. 
Manoj Misra, convenor of the Yamuna Jiye Abhiyaan, said the water available on the stretch is meant to be used for drinking purposes and this arrangement should not be disturbed. ?
he said.Environmentalist Vikram Soni, a professor at Centre for Theoretical Physics, Jamia Millia Islamia, said the plan does not seem feasible because the river does not have enough water except for the three months during monsoon. ?
The study said that water taxi and recreation activities are the most feasible and environmentally sustainable for this stretch.
