By Yoshita Singh New York, Jun 18 (PTI) Leading online lodging service Airbnb is buying a California-based background-check startup founded by three Indian-origin entrepreneurs in 2014 as it seeks to protect its users and hosts from undesirable and fraudulent people. 
A report in Fortune magazine said Airbnb is buying Trooly, a startup that specialises in technology that helps conduct background checks. 
Trooly said on its website that it uses public and permissible digital footprints to understand and predict the trustworthiness of individuals and businesses. 
The Fortune report said an Airbnb spokesperson confirmed the acquisition but did not disclose the price or the number of workers involved. 
"We look forward to welcoming the Trooly team to Airbnb in the coming weeks," the Airbnb spokesperson said in the Fortune said.
