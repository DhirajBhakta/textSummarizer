The actor finally opened up in an interview about the posts that made everyone sit up and take notice.Talking to Outlook, Abhay said, "This may be my first such post on Facebook, but I have tweeted about the issue in the past. 
I have been making an effort in my own space... 
Honestly, I was just expressing my views - I did it for awareness, though with a bit of fun... 
The FB post was a little provocative, to make people think."
Abhay's posts targetted some of the most powerful names in Bollywood, but he did get some support for his cause. 
The Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara actor said, "I received a lot of support from people and media. 
I am calling them out for their practices. 
I got one call from an actress saying I am doing the right thing, that's it."
