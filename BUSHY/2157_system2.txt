New Delhi, Dec 7 (PTI) The Enforcement Directorate today today launched an operation to inquire about deposits at over 50 bank branches, with a special eye on Jan Dhan, student and dormant accounts, across the country to detect money laundering and hawala instances through these channels. 
The agency said it is keeping a watch on those accounts in which huge amount of money has been deposited post demonetisation. 
The teams inquired the accounts where sudden spike in deposits and thereafter corresponding transfers have taken place. 
The agency conducted the operations at branches located in major cities like Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Chennai and others based on records of transaction of these branches where the maximum amount of old notes have been deposited or huge cash has been deposited in bank accounts in one go or in a staggered fashion giving rise to suspicion of suspect deposits.
