Mumbai, Apr 30 (PTI) Actor Irrfan Khan reveals filmmaker Tigmanshu Dhulia had offered him to play the titular role in "Revolver Rani," which later went to Kangana Ranaut. 
The 50-year-old actor says he had almost joined the project but did not take up the offer due to "intimate scenes" in the film. 
"I was offered the role of a woman in Tigmanshu Dhulias Revolver Rani. 
He had offered me Kangana Ranauts role when he was producing the film. 
But there were some intimate scenes that I thought people will not enjoy," Irrfan told PTI. 
"I would love to play a woman on-screen. 
But I am not ok with intimate scenes as that might put them (audience) off," he adds.
