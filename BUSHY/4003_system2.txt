In December, CISF had started trial runs for this but stamping was resumed after a week due to security concerns. 
CISF DG OP Singh said.Recently, CISF had conducted trial runs in two phases at 12 airports and concluded that stamping of baggage tags could be dispensed with after certain modifications of security architecture in Security Hold Areas of the airports and installation of high definition CCTV cameras. 
These modifications were required to make sure that passengers could not access bags containing restricted items which are segregated by CISF personnel for checking. ?
CISF staff at the boarding gates have been asked not to check for  baggage tag.
