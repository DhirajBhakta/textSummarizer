Besides four Bharatiya Janata Party legislators, there were two more in the 70-member Delhi Vidhan Sabha who voted for Ramnath Kovind, the NDA-backed presidential candidate who emerged the winner  on Thursday.The ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP)?
Of the total 69 MLAs of Delhi, 67 -- 63 AAP, 4 BJP -- voted in the presidential polls on Monday. 
Despite the four votes from the BJP that went to Kovind, the former governor of Bihar who won with a landslide victory in the Presidential elections on Thursday, got a total of six votes --- which means that two AAP MLAs had cross-voted. 
While we know for sure Kapil Mishra voted for Kovind, the other one must be some suspended MLA only,? 
Bhardwaj was among the two MLAs who did not vote in the elections as he was out of town.
