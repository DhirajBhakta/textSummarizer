"No one should expect us to swallow the bitter fruit that is harmful to our sovereignty, security or development interests," Xi said as the Peoples Liberation Army (PLA) is engaged in a standoff with Indian troops at Doklam in the Sikkim section since mid-June. 
Xi, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, made the remarks at the ceremony to mark the 90th founding anniversary of the 2.3 million strong PLA, the worlds largest standing army. 
He said China would never allow "any people, organisation or political party to split any part of Chinese territory out of the country at any time, in any form." 
We will never seek aggression or expansion, but we have the confidence to defeat all invasions," Xi, 64, said at the ceremony held at the Great Hall of the People attended by Premier Li Keqiang and other top leaders of the ruling Communist Party and army officials. 
On July 30, Xi during a massive PLA parade had said, "I firmly believe that our gallant military has both confidence and ability to defeat all invading enemies".
