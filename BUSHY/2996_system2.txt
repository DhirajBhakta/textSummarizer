This tragic incident led to many changes especially with better safety measures being implemented by IT/BT and BPO companies.However, in Bengaluru where the incident took place, it looks some companies are still trying to save money by not providing their women employees who work in the night shift with cab pick-up and drop facilities. 
Manisha Kumari, a technical recruiter, has decided to bring out the lackadaisical attitude of the company officials when it comes to safety of women at their workplace.Having joined this tech company in the month of February, she was told that there would be no cab pick-up and drop facility for one month and thereafter things would be sorted out.
