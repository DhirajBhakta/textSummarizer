New Delhi, Aug 1 (PTI) Finance Minister Arun Jaitley today said a "proper decision" would be taken on Air Indias future in a competitive market and that it would be in the governments interest to protect jobs at the airline. 
His remarks come at a time when a group of ministers headed by him is working on the modalities for the divestment of loss-making Air India. 
"Is mein karmchariyon ke services bachee rahen, is mein hamara bhi swarth hai (It will be in the interest of the government to protect the jobs at Air India)," he said while replying to a discussion on Supplementary Demands for Grants. 
Noting that the airline has a debt of Rs 50,0000-55,000 crore which is "not small", he said, "now we have to decide what has to be done with the Air India".
