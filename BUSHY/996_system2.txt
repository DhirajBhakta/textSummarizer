s head teacher, told HT.The school, which was established in 1998 attracted children from the neighbouring villages.

The village has only six to seven students from class 1-8 who now study in other schools in the neighbouring villages,? 
Krishna Verma, who is the sole female teacher, said.A retired army man, Kashiram and a farmer, Ghanshyam Singh, are regular visitors.The teachers have approached the education department in Jaipur to shift them on deputation to other nearby schools where there is vacancy for Sanskrit teachers. ?
The school has a glorious past, said Prabhudayal Sharma, who joined as a teacher in 2003. ?
