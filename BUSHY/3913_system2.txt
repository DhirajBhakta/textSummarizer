Hyderabad, Mar 5 (PTI) Academy Award-winning composer AR Rahman never realised that he was born for music and it was his mother who predicted that he would be a music composer. 
"I never knew that I was born for music. 
My mom made the choice and she kind of predicted that I will be a music composer. 
The day I realized that music would be my passion and future was when I went to my studio that had no equipment. 
I felt one day I will have all types of equipment all over this place that I cant afford now." 
"Around 1986, I stopped playing for other composers. 
I felt practicing or learning about music was my investment. 
I didnt care about opportunities. 
I felt its a jinx to go behind people."
