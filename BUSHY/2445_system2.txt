As the Hindustan Times approached the power officials for comments, within hours, an image-conscious energy department sorted out the matter - having slashed the net payable amount by Rs 12.82 lakh, changed the faulty energy meter of the consumer, issued a showcause notice to the junior engineer (revenue) concerned, while also deciding to change the rural revenue franchisee of the area. 
The negligence on the part of our officers was that the junior engineer (JE)-revenue, who is supposed to cross-check cases of abnormal billing, did not do so before releasing the bill to the consumer. 
Suspecting that this may not be a one-off case, the power firm has also ordered that energy bills over Rs 1 lakh of domestic, non-domestic and low-tension industrial subscriber be screened in Samastipur.Lakshmanan said the revised bill of Rs 2,992 was cumulative of the average bill since February 2017, when the meter went awry, and the actual consumption between July 2016 and January 2017. 
Kumar had last paid his energy bill in June 2016.
