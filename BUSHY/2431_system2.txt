During her recent interview with HTBrunch, Pooja Bhatt revealed that after making sensitive movies like Zakhm and Tamanna, she ventured into adult content with Jism because those kind of movies have a mass appeal.?
The age that Alia is today, I had made a film on female infanticide. 
Then I made Zakhm, again a sensitive movie based on my father?
Then I made Jism. 
It is people who made Jism run to packed houses. 
One that you make to jolt the audience and the other is the kind you make to soothe the jolted. 
At the end of the day I want people to watch my films. 
I am not interested in making movies that only 10 people will watch and will get critical appreciation at some festival.?
For I certainly know what I want.
