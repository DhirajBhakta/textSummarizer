The slain terrorists included Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) commander Bashir Lashkari who was involved in the killing of six policemen in south Kashmir and top Hizbul Mujahideen militant Sabzar Ahmad Bhat, he noted. 
The security forces and police are going after terrorists as part of the operation "hunt down" and on the basis of a "hit-list" of terrorists, said the official who refused to be identified.
