The Ministry of Civil Aviation earlier this month released draft rules on a "national no-fly list" for unruly passengers for all domestic carriers. 
The draft has been placed in the public domain for 30 days inviting comments and feedback from stakeholders. 
The draft was released on May 5 and comments have been invited until June 4. 
The ministry has so far received 25 responses from various stakeholders. 
The official said the governments intention is to have a balance, but added that those who gave feedback felt the draft rules were "tilted towards airlines". 
The proposed no-fly list will compile data on disruptive passengers from all airlines. 
The government has recommended three levels of unruly behaviours- each entailing a corresponding duration for flying ban. 
The first level of misdemeanor, which includes verbal harassment or physical gesture, carries a flying ban of three months. 
The second level comprises physically abusive behaviour and will carry a ban of six months.
