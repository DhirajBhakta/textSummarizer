I wanted to do something new and different, and this new show will be unlike my earlier show, Comedy Nights Bachao, and even Kapil?
A post shared by Krushna Abhishek (@krushna30) on Jun 24, 2017 at 2:08am PDT The show will star actors Ali Asgar and Sugandha Mishra, and will also have Preeti Simoes, the ex-creative director of Kapil?
There is no competition with Kapil, but now that Ali and others are in my show, people will link it to Kapil again, saying they left him to join me.
