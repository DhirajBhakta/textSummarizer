Bollywood actor Akshay Kumar attended the Women?
This has given Akshay an idea: how about Indian men and women cricketers coming together to form one team??
t there be a men and women cricket match against another country? 
t they have mixed cricket teams where six Indian men and six Indian women play against Australia?
says Akshay.The actor not only rooted for the Indian women?
I was talking to the girls and one of them said that it would be so much fun if Virat Kohli ran from one side and a lady was on the other side [of the batting pitch],? 
These Women have started a Revolution and I couldn't be more proud ?? 
I was watching a Wimbledon [tennis] match on my phone recently and this idea just struck me,?
