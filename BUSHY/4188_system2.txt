New Delhi, Mar 19 (PTI) Describing demonetisation as an attempt akin to striking a rock with an egg, eminent Austrian economist Heinz D Kurz has said it is much too weak and misdirected an instrument to root out corruption. 
Noting that while the goal of fighting corruption is laudable, he said: "I consider it to be singularly naive to think that this can be done by banning some banknotes. 
"There appears also to be evidence that the policy of demonetisation opened new channels of corruption." 
Kurz pointed out that whoever was informed about the demonetisation policy ahead of its introduction (sort of insider trading) could have used the information and laundered money. 
Asked about impact of demonetisation on Indias economic growth, Kurz said that "first, it is much too early to assess already the impact of demonetisation, which will show up only later. 
The Indian economy is going pretty strong, Kurtz said, adding however that not well thought out policies such as the demonetisation project have the potential of affecting it badly.
