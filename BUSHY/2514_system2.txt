s Mahagun Moderne society after maid is ?
Residents said that the society has 2,750 flats in its 16 high-rise and four low-rise buildings. 
Anupam Thapa (@anupamthapa) July 13, 2017Residents also said most of the inhabitants used to get domestic helps through the security guards, who knew the maids. ?
There is record of the entry and exit of society visitors and the helps. 
However, after the situation was brought under control, some residents tried to give entry to the maids, but were stopped. 
In future, this will become a culture in Noida and residents will have no say. 
From rape to assault, every allegation was levelled against the residents of our housing society. 
When we asked the security guards of the society, they used batons on us. 
We know the chaos would make the women jobless, but oppression cannot be tolerated by anyone in the society,?
