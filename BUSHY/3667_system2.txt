I knew that an epic film of this proportion would take this much time to be made. 
My character kills a lot of people in the film, that doesn't mean that I will get inspired by him and start killing people. 
Once I'm told about the character, I can't stop thinking about it. 
It was the love of the audience in their own way, I would say.Back in real life, do you sometimes approach a problem or situation asking yourself how Baahubali would have approached the same situation?
I never thought of it, but if Baahubali were to approach a situation or problem, he would just smile it off.
