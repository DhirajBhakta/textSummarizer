And Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that there are no VIPs, every Indian is a very important person.On Wednesday, Air India (AI) scrapped one more privilege, this time an in-house one. 
But now only VIPs will continue to use the services of porters, the airline staff will be discouraged to use it. ?
The move would have got a higher rating if this privilege was taken away from VIPs too. 
In January, flight data firm FlightStats marked AI as the third worst-performing airline in the world. 
It is important to manage perceptions and AI has to invest time, effort and money into it apart from doing away with perks and privileges extended to staff.
