Open champion is provisionally banned from all International Tennis Federation (ITF) events after hurling allegedly racist and sexist comments during Romania's Fed Cup tie with Britain last month.All England Club chairman Philip Brook said he "condemned" the behaviour of two-time Wimbledon runner-up Nastase."
In terms of an invitation to the Royal Box, he won't receive one this year," Brook said at the club's spring news conference.Club chief executive Richard Lewis went further, saying Nastase "could be stopped at the gate" if he tried to enter the grounds with a ticket.
