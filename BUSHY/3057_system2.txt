London, Jun 11 (PTI) It seems that British Prime Minister Theresa May was not the only one who lost big in the UK polls. 
A punter lost a whopping 70,000 pounds betting on a Tory majority, believing the election was "unlosable" for May. 
The person was one of many who apparently believed the upcoming general election to be "unlosable", the bookmaker was quoted as saying by The Independent. 
Bookmakers hailed a bumper evening as large numbers of people placed big bets on the Conservatives to romp to a convincing victory which was not to be. 
Joe Crilly, a spokesperson for the bookmaker, was quoted as saying that, "The general election result was a good one for us bookies as the Tories managed to fluff their lines in what was being billed as the unlosable election." 
"We had a number of five figure bets on the Conservatives winning a majority, with some wagers at prices as short as 1/16, although one punter from London will be breathing a sigh of relief after backing the Conservatives to win the most seats to the tune of 200,000 pounds," he said.
