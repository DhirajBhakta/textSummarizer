Limaye had proposed that instead of there being any voting on the revised ICC governance structure and revised financial model, the same should be taken up during the meetings to be held in April 2017 since there wasn't sufficient time for BCCI to study the proposals and formulate its position. 
Treasurer expressed their inability to attend the said meeting, the Acting Secretary did meet with us on April 21, 2017 and we briefed him on our prior discussions with the ICC and other cricket boards so that he would be aware of their respective views/ positions.9.We believe that the outcome of the ICC Board Meetings held in Dubai during the last week of April 2017 could have been avoided if the resolutions passed during the Special General Meeting held on April 18, 2017 had authorized the Acting Secretary to arrive at a negotiated outcome (within certain parameters akin to those set out during an earlier Special General Meeting held on February 19, 2016) instead of directing him to either seek deferment of a vote and, if that was not agreed to by the ICC and other cricket boards, vote against the revised ICC governance structure and revised financial model.
