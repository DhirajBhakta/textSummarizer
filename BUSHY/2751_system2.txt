China has called off the annual media trip that it organises for journalists to travel to Tibet. 
One of the participants, Vijay Naik, Convenor of Indian Association of Foreign Affairs Correspondents said, "The invite was received but because the tensions have increased the Chinese may have thought of letting things cool down and let the atmosphere become conducive again for the media programme to resume. 
It is really disappointing".The Chinese embassy organises these annual trips to Tibet with journalists from the region. 
This last minute cancellation many believe is the direct result of the border tensions at the tri-junction where India (in Sikkim), China and Bhutan meet.
