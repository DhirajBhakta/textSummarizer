Dozens of pregnant women protested on Tuesday outside the Nagarkurnool government hospital, located 133 km from Hyderabad, since no gynecologists were available to deliver their babies, or offer medical treatment.They began protesting after they were asked to go to Mahbubnagar district hospital, located an hour's drive away.In tears, the father of a woman suffering labour pains expressed helplessness over his family's plight. 
She...is in her ninth month," he said.Police reached the spot after learning of the protest, which ended after the women received an assurance from the hospital's superintendent.The Nagarkurnool government hospital doesn't have the five gynecologists and two anesthetists it needs to cope with the demand for medical care, so patients are forced to go to private clinics, or to Mahbubnagar.All this happened while Telangana ministers were busy tweeting about the K Chandrashekhar Rao (KCR) government's achievements in the healthcare sector. 
IT minister K Tarakrama Rao - who is KCR's son - tweeted photos of the refurbished King Koti and Malakpet hospitals in Hyderabad as examples of the 'changing face of healthcare in the state.'
