Several eyewitnesses said the "ugly episode" took place around 1 AM when a group of four to five women, apparently working with the various pubs in the vicinity, were waiting outside Sahara Mall for transport. 
Lal said a fresh round of arguments began after which one of the men tried to pull one of the women to where his vehicle was parked. 
"The situation is worst on weekends," said a resident.A security guard at the mall, who refused to be named, said when the patrons come out of these night clubs, they try to strike deals with women, some of whom are regular employees and others who facilitate entry to stag pub-goers.
