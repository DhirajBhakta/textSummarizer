Bhopal, May 2 (PTI) The Madhya Pradesh Cabinet today gave an in-principle nod to granting the status of "living human entity" to Narmada river, over a month after the Uttarakhand HC accorded the status to the Ganga and Yamuna rivers. 
The proposal would be discussed during the one-day session of the Assembly tomorrow, Public Relations Department Minister Narottam Mishra said after attending a Cabinet meeting chaired by Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan. 
Participating in the Namami Devi Narmade Seva Yatra in the state last month, Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh had suggested the MP government bring a bill in the Assembly to accord the living entity status to the river. 
Chouhan had assured his government would introduce a bill to this effect in the next session of the Assembly. 
At the Cabinet meeting today, the CM also asked all departments to put up the logo of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay centenary year on their letterheads, hoardings, posters, banners and advertisements. 
The BJP is observing the birth centenary year of Upadhyay, an RSS-ideologue and former president of Bhartiya Jana Sangh, the BJP forerunner.
