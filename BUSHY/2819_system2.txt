Over the years, speculations over Rajinikanth's entry into politics is a news that never sleeps. 
While Rajinikanth is likely to float his own political party by the end of this year, reports now suggest that Thalaivar is keen on discussing his political career with his friend, Amitabh Bachchan. ? Speaking about the news, a close friend of Rajinikanth was quoted by DNA as saying, "He may be mildly tempted to get into active politics, but he won't. 
His family is dead against bringing politics into Rajini's career. 
They cite the example of Amitabh Bachchan, who to this day, regrets his sticky stint in politics.""
Even though there is a lot of pressure on him to get into active politics from many quarters, he is no hurry to bite the bait. 
He will be meeting old friends whose judgment he trusts, including Bachchan saab and discuss it with them," the source added. 
After all these years, will Thalaivar finally venture into politics?
