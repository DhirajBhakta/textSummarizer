Mumbai, Apr 6 (PTI) Asha Parekhs versatility helped her feature in films of diverse genres in the 1960s but the veteran actress says being on top is often lonesome and there was a phase where she went into depression. 
It wasnt the highs and lows of the film business that unsettled the 74-year-old actress but the death of her parents, which pushed her into a dark zone. 
I lost my parents. 
I was feeling miserable and had these (suicidal) thoughts. 
It is a struggle, I had to take aid of the doctors to get out of it," Parekh told PTI in an interview. 
I was very lucky I had lovely parents with me. 
So after losing her, I got into depression.
