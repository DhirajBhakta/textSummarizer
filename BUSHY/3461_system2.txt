Rajgir (Bihar), May 4 (PTI) RJD chief Lalu Prasad today asked his party workers to tie old, non-milking cows outside the houses of BJP leaders to see if they really cared for the animal. 
He asked his party men to do so to substantiate his allegation that the BJP and the RSS are using the issue of cow protection for garnering votes. 
Look for old, non-milking cows and tie them outside their houses to see how they treat the animal," he told a RJD national executive meeting. 
We need to show if they are really concerned about cow service," he said. 
The RJD chief, who played a major role in the Mandal movement of 1990 that aimed at ensuring social justice in the country, alleged that the BJP was now "rushing to garland the statues of Dalit icon B R Ambedkar but was doing nothing to uplift deprived sections". 
He accused the BJP and the RSS of making efforts to scrap reservation in government jobs and demanded that quota be introduced for three of the four seats of the Shankaracharyas. 
The RJD chief also asked his party men to desist from making any comments that could led to strains in the ruling Grand Alliance in Bihar.
