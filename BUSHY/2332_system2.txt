Second set: *Williams 5-7, 0-2 Muguruza (*denotes next server)Four games ago Williams had two points for the first set but the wheels are coming off now. 15-0, 30-0, 40-0 for Muguruza. 
Williams tries to impose her will on Muguruza on the second point too but just goes long. 15-all. 15-30. 15-40 after a tame shot from Muguruza. 
First set: *Williams 1-1 Muguruza (*denotes next server)Williams started her opening service game with an ace - Muguruza begins hers with a double fault. 
Muguruza goes back behind Williams, who manages to regain her footing and hit the ball, but Muguruza takes the point. 
A longer point then plays out - you feel the longer rallies are more likely to be won by the 23-year-old Muguruza today - and the 37-year-old Williams whistles wide. 15-all. 30-15, as Muguruza prods long.
