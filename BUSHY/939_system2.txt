Poll-bound Gujarat has joined the likes of Tamil Nadu,Odisha and Rajasthan  by coming out with its own version of canteens for  providing  meals to the poor at a highly subsidised rate.Under the Shamik Annapurna Yojna launched on Tuesday, labourers will be provided a meal per day at Rs 10. 
These ?stalls are at spots near various kadiyanakas (labourer markets).For the time being, some 25,000 labourers will be covered through 83 stalls set up across the state. 
chief minister Vijay Rupani,  who served piping hot meals to  workers at a stall in Narol area of Ahmedabad, said. 
The other two attendants will be managing crowds.Beneficiaries have to produce an identity card, either Aadhaar or voter card, and get themselves registered with the stall from which they wish to buy food every day.?
