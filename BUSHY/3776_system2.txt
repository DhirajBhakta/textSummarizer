But the film wowed critics and audiences alike and the rest is history.Speaking about how he got the role, Vivek Oberoi spoke to Hindustan Times and said, "My father was planning to launch me in an Abbas Mustan film. 
But I always wanted to become an actor on my own, so I told him that I would like to go through my struggle. 
So I went to RGV sir's office, and told him to give me an audition for the role of Chandu. 
I told him my name was Vivek Anand. 
He told me I look too good for the role, and he wanted to cast someone who looked like a gangster from the slums."
I, then persuaded the stunt director to shoot the same scene with me," Vivek said.
