The next time you spot actor Kalki Koechlin, don?
The actor is apparently fed up of fans coming to her with the phone cameras in selfie mode. 
I wish people were more keen to talk to you, instead of taking a selfie. 
We are obsessed with this selfie culture. 
says Kalki, who was last seen in actor Konkona Sen Sharma?
s directorial debut A Death in the Gunj.Fans are a big part of an actor?
s one thing for actors to speak up. 
Everyone is guilty of endorsing fairness creams as much as actors. 
s easy for people to wait for actors to make the change. 
It has to be a collective decision, which needs to come from everyone.
