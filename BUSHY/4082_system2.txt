The Central Board of Film Certification headed by Pahlaj Nihalani has asked the makers of the film Sameer to delete the phrase 'Mann ki baat' from a dialogue in the film.The reason being that the phrase, as we all know it, is the name of the monthly radio address given to our country by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.In the last scene of Dakxin Chhara's film Sameer, after a series of twists, the actual identity of the lead character played by Subrat Dutta is revealed. 
When I approached the Censor Board chief Pahlaj Nihalani, he told me: PM ka radio show hai, delete the line," director Chhara was quoted as saying.When asked under what guidelines Chhara was asked to get the phrase deleted from his film, the director said, "We were not given an oral hearing before censor board members, which is supposed to be mandatory. 
The board, despite granting us an A (adults only) certificate, asked for certain scenes involving torture, and bomb blast, to be chopped mercilessly.
