Last month, Shah Rukh Khan attended the TED 2017 conference in Vancouver, Canada and gave a fantastic speech that was tweeted about and written about by whoever was lucky enough to witness SRK speak.Yesterday, the entire filmed episode of Shah Rukh Khan's speech was uploaded on the TED website and within minutes, the video got viral. 
And for good reason.Shah Rukh Khan began by saying that he sells dreams and peddles love to millions of Indians who assume that he is the world's best lover."
If you don't tell anyone, I'm going to tell you I'm not, but I never let that assumption go away," Shah Rukh Khan added and the crowd laughed wildly.Shah Rukh Khan then went on to speak about humanity comparing it to himself, an ageing movie star."
It's an ageing movie star, grappling with all the newness around itself, wondering whether it got it right in the first place, and still trying to find a way to keep on shining regardless," SRK said.In one of the talk's best moments, Shah Rukh Khan said, "In its immense generosity, India decided somehow that I, the Muslim son of a broke freedom fighter who accidentally ventured into the business of selling dreams, should become its king of romance, the 'Badshah of Bollywood,' the greatest lover the country has ever seen ... with this face. 
The people of this ancient land embraced me in their limitless love, and I've learned from these people that neither power nor poverty can make your life more magical or less tortuous," Shah Rukh Khan added.
