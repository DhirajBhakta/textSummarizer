Nagpur, Jul 1 (PTI) Union minister Ramdas Athawale today said the ICC Champions Trophy final between India and Pakistan appeared "fixed" and demanded a probe into the matter. 
The Union minister of state for social justice and empowerment also batted for 25 per cent reservation for Dalits and tribals in cricket and other games, saying these sections have never got due recognition in sports.

On the recent attacks by cow vigilantes, Athawale said lynching people in the name of rau raksha (cow protection) was wrong.
