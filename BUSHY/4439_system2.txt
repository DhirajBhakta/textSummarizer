New Delhi, Feb 28 (PTI) MPs and MLAs should be recalled within two years from being elected if 75 per cent of those who voted for them are not satisfied with their performance, according to a bill moved by BJP MP Varun Gandhi. 
As per the legislation, recalling process can be initiated by any voter of the constituency by filing a petition before the Speaker, signed by at least one-fourth of the total number of electors in that constituency. 
The Commission will verify the signatures on it and will organise the voting on 10 places in the respective constituency of MP or MLA, it says.
