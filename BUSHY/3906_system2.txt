He has given innumerable hits and some great performances in a career spanning over two decades, but has never won a national award. 
But it all changed for Akshay Kumar on Friday afternoon (April 7) when he won the national award for Best Actor for Rustom. 
And his performance in 2016 film Rustom has won him his first national award. 
Akshay, who won his first national award, said that he has been honest towards his work. 
Neither have I ever made a call to anyone to win an award nor have given money or done favours for it," he added. 
I would like to dedicate this award to my parents, my family and especially my lovely wife who often jokes that it is good that you have stopped going to award shows as you never get an award - khaer, der aaye, durust aaye. 
The 30-year-old actor received a special mention for Neerja at National Awards.
