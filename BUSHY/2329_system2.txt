Richard Craig, a former Nucla town board member, recalled a comment by a member of an environmental group saying during one of the contentious hearings: ?
Several Nucla residents told me, with disgust, that they could not imagine living in a town that big, and some said they tried to visit as little as possible. 
Miller, who runs an Airbnb in her house, said the guests she gets stay for just one night, stopping over on their way somewhere else.Thompson, who is also the president of the local historical society, is doing what she can to celebrate the town?
But progress on building a larger museum is slow and after years of effort, Thompson said that Nucla and Naturita still feel like an afterthought to the broader world, their culture and history less of a priority. ?
