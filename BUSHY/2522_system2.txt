Convict Afzal Guru hanged inside Tihar jail. 
Prison officials said though there is a post of an executioner in the prison manual ever since its construction in the mid 1950s, jail records do not show any name who has worked as one. 
Over the past years, the jail has received letters from the public offering to be executioners. 
They were residents of a Meerut village, the same place where a hangman employed at a UP jail lives. 
In 1989, we had used the services of a hangman from Meerut jail. 
Gupta said another reason why the jail did not have a hangman was because the man would have no job.
