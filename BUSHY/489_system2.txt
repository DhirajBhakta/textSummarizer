I am very happy that Arjun and Parineeti have agreed to join me in this journey and I hope that this film can become one of their best outings,?

Namastey Canada is exactly the film I was looking for! 
Vipul Amrutlal Shah has directed Action Replayy, Aankhen, Waqt, Namastey London and has also produced films like Singh Is Kinng and Holiday.Follow @htshowbiz for more
