 Health services were crippled at the district hospital in Sector 30 for four hours on Monday as contractual doctors and paramedical staff went on a strike and protested against the hospital administration for not paying them salaries for the last three months. 
The wages of the contractual staff are provided by the Noida authority, which are later disbursed by the hospital administration. 
Due to the protest, patients and permanent staff at the hospital faced inconvenience. 
The staff strength of 350 is enough to take care of patients in a facility the size of the district hospital. 
The hospital has maintained the record of our duties and it should stand with us,?
