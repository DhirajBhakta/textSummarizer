The Opposition slammed the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led Maharashtra government for mentioning the names of former Congress Prime Ministers Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi in state board history textbooks in reference to the Emergency and Bofors scam, respectively. 
Legislators raised uproar in the state legislative council demanding the government delete these references and alleged the state government is trying to drive its political agenda by influencing educational material. 
Legislators from the Congress as well as the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) supported the demand, saying there is little description of all significant achievements of Congress and NCP leaders in the textbooks. 
State school education minister Vinod Tawde said the minister does not have any role in it and the textbooks are written by a committee of experts. ?
The BJP minister said it is unfair to say the government has omitted the description of significant achievements of Congress and NCP leaders. ?
