Kabir Khan's Tubelight has already grabbed eyeballs for the on-screen camaraderie between Salman Khan and Sohail Khan, who play brothers in the film too. 
The director, who has collaborated with Salman for the third time, said that he had a few actors in his mind during the scripting stage, and Khiladi Kumar was one of them. 
Maybe, with another actor, I would have had to spend time and create the chemistry that Salman and Sohail share," he added. 
However, it was Salman who was keen to get Sohail on board as he was convinced that their real-life bromance will translate effectively on screen. 
But I wanted to be really comfortable, and honestly, with Sohail, I didn't need to act too much. 
So when you see the tears in the film, sometimes, they are my own emotions as a brother," said Salman. 
Kabir, who has worked with Sohail for the first time, is happy with the actor's hardwork in the film.
