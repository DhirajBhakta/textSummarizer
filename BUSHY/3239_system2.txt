"Bowlers are pretty much second-class citizens in white-ball cricket," says former New Zealand pacer Shane Bond, who feels odds are stacked heavily against them in the limited-overs format.Writing for the International Cricket Council ahead of the upcoming Champions Trophy in England starting June 1, Bond said limited-overs cricket is "a batsman's game"."
The change in fielding restrictions in the last 10 overs of a one-day international has eased the pressure on the bowlers a little bit, but only a little bit," he said."...but for the most part, the bowlers are pretty much second-class citizens in white-ball cricket," he added.Bond said it is this imbalance which has led to spinners using negative tactics."
The slow bowlers specifically are resorting to a more negative line of bowling, not because they want to but because they have to," he said."
That philosophy has now gone out the window," he explained.Bond said bowlers cannot do without variety in the current scenario where every alternate game ends up being a run feast."
The yorker is not just one of the most difficult balls to bowl, the margin for error is also extremely small. 
bowl the yorker, yes, but also use the bouncer, the slower ball, the length ball," he opined."
You have to weigh up risk against reward," he said.Bond said bowlers in modern cricket should mix it up to make it difficult for the batsman to settle down.
