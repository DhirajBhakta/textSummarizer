Bipasha Basu and Karan Singh Grover are one of the fittest B-Town couples. 
And this International Yoga Day, the 'monkey couple' took a detour from their usual fitness regime and turned 'yogi monkeys'. 
Bipasha took to Instagram to share a few pictures performing different asanas with hubby Karan and wrote, "Yoga is like Life - It's a beautiful balance of Holding On and Letting Go. 
Happy #internationalyogaday #loveyourself #yogimonkey (sic)."
