The ultra-right Hindutva outfit and Sangh affiliate Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) believes the Alwar killing, where a mob lynched a Muslim man over suspicions of him being a cow smuggler, was an expression of the popular and spontaneous anger of the Hindus and that it had nothing to do with any Hindutva outfit."
The politicians of the secular brigade are the ones who have fuelled this by teasing Hindus into a state where they might react," VHP leader Surendra Jain said."
Asaduddin Owaisi stopped desecrating Hindu gods and goddesses when we told him in Hyderabad that we would be pushed to the wall and we could start the same for the Prophet," said VHPs international joint general secretary Surendra Jain. 
HINDUS ARE ANGRY, SAYS JAINThe Hindu community is in anger, Jain said, and that it could express itself in spontaneous ways that we don't have control over. 
Hindus will continue to be furious if their sentiments are hurt," he said."
