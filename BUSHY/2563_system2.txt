Veteran actor Ratna Pathak Shah, who will soon be seen in the film Lipstick Under My Burkha, has said the patriarchal structure anywhere in the world is hard not just on women but on men too. 
Ratna said.Lipstick Under My Burkha, which is about four women characters, will see Ratna essaying the role of a woman whose sexual longings awaken at the age of 55.Asked if the scenes where she had to show those urges in the film, made her uncomfortable or think twice about it, she said: ?
We desperately need some information, which is why Alankrita Shrivastava made this film, so that people get this information in one go -- so that our population grows from a billion to 10 billion perhaps,?
