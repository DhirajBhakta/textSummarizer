New Delhi, Jul 20 (PTI) After its Centre-funded restoration plan got shelved, the NDMC has decided to redevelop the iconic 150-year-old Town Hall in old Delhi through public-private partnership, the civic body today said. 
North Delhi Mayor Preety Agarwal said the redevelopment of the Town Hall in Chandni Chowk -- the headquarters of the erstwhile unified MCD -- into a centre of cultural and social heritage would be taken up on a PPP model. 
"An in-principle approval has been accorded for the PPP project," she said. 
North Delhi Municipal Commissioner Praveen Gupta said the restoration was initially planned to be funded by the Union Tourism Ministry but "could not be materialised on that front and now it would be developed on a PPP mode". 
He said if all goes well, the fresh project would be taken up in the "next nine months and is likely to be completed within two years". 
Gupta said apart from depicting the history of Delhi, the redevelopment project is also expected to earn good revenue for the corporation. 
Agarwal said the Town Hall would be redeveloped as an attractive tourist destination with "international standards", after which the city landmark would emerge as a centre of cultural and social heritage, depicting the history, culture and the life of Delhi. 
The mayor said the museum would be the main tourist attraction and it would occupy an area of about 1,574 sqm on the ground floor.
