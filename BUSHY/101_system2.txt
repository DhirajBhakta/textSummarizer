After a swarm of bees held up a Hyderabad-Pune flight last week for more than one hour, the country aviation regulator said it will investigate how a bee hive was allowed to flourish in the airport area. 
Air India spokesperson, Dhananjay Kumar, confirmed the incident and said that taking safety as priority, the pilot took necessary precautions before taking off the flight. ?
The swarms of bees kept coming and settling on the wind screen of the cockpit, not allowing the pilot to push back,? 
The pilot had to then call for a spray in order to get rid of the bees.
