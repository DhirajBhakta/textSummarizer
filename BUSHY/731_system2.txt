I remember watching Jab We Met in Bikaner with my parents and I felt this is an amazing film.?
Looking at the character of Geet (essayed by Kareena Kapoor Khan) I felt I should be doing films. 
she said.The film marks the third collaboration between Anushka and superstar Shah Rukh Khan after Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi and Jab Tak Hai Jaan.When asked about her first meeting with Shah Rukh, Anushka said the best thing the superstar did to her was to make her comfortable.Kareena Kapoor and Shahid Kapoor in Jab We Met.?
Later I realised that he was such a big support system for me in my first film, he made things easy for me as a newcomer without making it obvious.
