The Supreme Court on Thursday refused to stay the Election Commission decision allowing the NOTA provision in the August 8 Rajya Sabha polls in Gujarat.A bench of justices Dipak Misra, Amitava Roy and AM Khanwilkar, however, agreed to examine the constitutional validity of the August 1 notification of the poll panel allowing the NOTA option.?
the bench said when senior advocates Kapil Sibal, AM Singhvi and Harin Raval, representingGujarat Congress chief whip Shailesh Manubhai Parmar, sought an interim stay on the notification.The bench questioned the delay by the opposition party in filing its petition, pointing out that the poll panel had issued a notification on the matter in January 2014 and another circular in 2015.?
Six Gujarat MLAs switched over from the Congress to the BJP last week, seen as a major blow to the prospects of the opposition party candidate Ahmed Patel.The Congress is apprehensive of cross voting and some MLAs exercising the NOTA option.Last week, the party flew most of its Gujarat  MLAs to Bengaluru to protect them from what it says is the BJP?
