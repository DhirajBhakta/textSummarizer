In that, alongwith liquor prohibition, betting and stopping the intake of gutkha, it was also decided to curtail the wearing of such clothes and use of mobiles. 
Everyone agreed over the order issued over mobile use," Phauran Singh, Panchayat head (panch patel) said.The decision to prohibit the use of mobile phones or wearing of jeans was arrived at by consensus during the panchayat meeting. 
"The panchayat that happened in the village happened for the benefit of the society and have taken the vow to disown liquor, betting alongwith other evil practices of the society. 
The decision to keep the matter before panch patel in case of a dispute is also right," Jagdish, a villager, said.PROTESTS AGAINST LIQUOR PROHIBITION In several villages of Rajasthan, there have been protests in favour of liquor prohibition with the villagers seeking a total ban on sale and consumption of alcohol. 
The ban imposed on girls from keeping mobiles or wearing jeans in the panchayat is violation of law and is not right.
