Regarding her father-in-law's statements, Ayesha had expressed her grief and rage regarding them on Twitter.if wot im reading about my father in laws statements r true then me and Farhan are deeply embarrassed n ashamed...We surely do nottt share this mindset...its disrespectful to women.if these statements r true then its sad.Well, yesterday actor Esha Gupta took to a dig at Abu Azmi's rampant misogny and tweeted that the only woman to blame in regard to Abu Azmi's remarks is his mother for unknowingly giving birth to a "jerk".Abu Azmi's enraged son Farhan Azmi took to Twitter and attacked Esha in the most vile manner possible.Meanwhile, on a completely unrelated note, Farhan Akhtar had tweeted the following.But then, Farhan Azmi took offense to that as well and attacked Farhan Akhtar.
