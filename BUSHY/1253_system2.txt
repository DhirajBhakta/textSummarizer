Pawan Sharma, the founder of RAWW, a wildlife conservation NGO shared his feelings on the subject on Facebook and wrote, "Actress Shruti Ulfat and three others from Nagarjun daily soap booked by Mumbai Range of Thane Territorial wing of the forest department for using Spectacled Cobra, protected species under Wildlife Protection Act, Schedule 2. 
They were produced in court yesterday and court gave forest department their custody for a day to know and find the people who supplied snake to them. 
When I had assisted the Anti Poaching Unit of the Forest Department for primary investigations at the Film City in October last year the actress made us wait for an hour with her rude staff which did not cooperate and all of them had misled the forest department stating that it was VFX /Graphics and not a real snake. 
Posing for entertainment with a protected species which is one of the top venomous snakes of the country is unethical, illegal and misleading.
