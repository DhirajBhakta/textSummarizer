Actor Tiger Shroff says though he likes to flaunt his dance skills and well-built body on screen, he wouldn?
He believes he is a fairly good dancer and that he went through intensive rehearsals to get each and every single dance move right.What makes him go through this process despite having the option for a re-take while filming?
I want to practice and prepare to set my skill and signature as an actor different. 
Yes, I can do a lot of re-takes, but taking the extra struggle will help me to prove myself differently.?
Every morning I get up and thank the almighty for all the love and admiration I am receiving from people, my fans... from everyone. 
Then I go back to my zone... to make my skill sharper...?
