A Chinese spy ship has been spotted off the coast of Queensland during a joint training exercise between Australian and US forces, the defence department has confirmed.The Type 815 Auxiliary General Intelligence (AGI) vessel was sighted during war games, known as Exercise Talisman Sabre, and defence officials told the ABC?
s presence did not interfere with the operation of Talisman Sabre.The three-week training exercise in central Queensland has involved more than 33,000 personnel from Australia, the United States, New Zealand, Japan and Canada. 
Australia respects the rights of all states to exercise freedom of navigation in international waters in accordance with international law,? 
Coinciding with a joint exercise with the United States, clearly that sends quite an unfriendly message ... at the moment what we see is a double standard where China picks the areas of the law of the sea that it likes and refuses to implement those that it doesn?
