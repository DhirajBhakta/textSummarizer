 About 300 Ola and Uber taxi drivers have sought state BJP president Raosaheb Danve?
The scheme was introduced by the Maharashtra government to provide a level-playing field for all types of taxis and curb surge-pricing.The drivers urged Danve to convince the state government to make changes to the scheme or scrap it. 
Under the scheme, the state  has made it mandatory for  drivers using their vehicles for app-based taxi services like Ola and Uber, to register themselves with the transport authorities and follow several rules. 
The drivers are scheduled to meet chief minister Devendra Fadnavis on Friday to discuss the matter.?
