After the embarrassing loss of vote and face for Board of Cricket Control for India (BCCI) at the International Cricket Council (ICC) and left to deal with defiant office bearers, the head of BCCI Committee of Administrators (CAO) Vinod Rai urged legends of Indian cricket to speak up to ensure cricket administration improves. 
Closing his speech Rai addressing Tendulkar said, "I think Indian cricket is once again at its peak, you would agree. 
?He went on to urge the former greats of Indian cricket to take a stand over administrative matters using their position of influence to clean the system. 
"I would suggest that because of the fact that they deserve something far better, legends like Kapil (Dev), Sourav (Ganguly), Anil Kumble, Rahul Dravid, Sunil Gavaskar and Sachin Tendulkar need to in some ways mentor these people and also speak up and ensure that cricket administration in this country improves.
