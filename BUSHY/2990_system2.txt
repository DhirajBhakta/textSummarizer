Custom officials recently busted separate gangs of smugglers who were illegally transporting gold concealed in microwave ovens, toys, wafers and confectionery boxes. 
This week, officials seized five kilograms of gold in different forms in separate cases worth approximately Rs 1.4 crore. 
They added that they also seized around a kilogram of gold (996 gm), which was being smuggled as gold foils concealed inside a carton and packing boxes of wafers, confectionery items and toys. 
GOLD HIDDEN IN METAL BAR OF TROLLEY"The gold foil was so thin and was concealed in such a way that it was difficult to detect it in the X-ray scanning machines," said a senior custom officer, adding that a 50-year-old passenger from Dubai was arrested. 
In another case, smugglers had concealed 1.4 kg gold inside the coil of a microwave oven. 
The gold was hidden in the metal bar of a luggage trolley. 
According to officials, gold smuggling at the airport has taken a major hit due to demonetisation. 
In these cases, the customs authorities seized 450 kg of gold, valued at a whopping Rs 132 crore (as per prevailing market rates), a senior customs official had said. 
About 260 kg of gold (as against 450 kg seizure in the previous financial year), valued at `76.31 crore (as per the current market rate), was seized by customs officials at the Delhi airport, he said.
