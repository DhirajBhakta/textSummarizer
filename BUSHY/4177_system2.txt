The BJP today dismissed reports that the RSS had anything to do with the selection of hardliner Yogi Adityanath as the Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister and said it is unfair to criticise the decision without giving the Gorakhpur MP a "fair opportunity" to govern."
The RSS (Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh) never interferes with the selection of chief ministers," Union Minister M Venkaiah Naidu said a day after Adityanath took over as the 21st Chief Minister of the state.A number of the former or serving members of the RSS, which is the ideological fountainhead of the BJP, have been appointed Chief Ministers recently. 
There will be zero tolerance towards crime," Adityanath's minister Shrikant Sharma said.On Sunday, shortly after he took oath, Yogi Adityanath had pledged to work for all sections without bias and said he believed in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's slogan: 'sabka saath sabka vikas'.Addressing his first press conference after taking oath, the controversial Gorakhpur MP also vowed to end the law and order problems in the sprawling and the country's most populous state.In an apparent move to allay fears that he, as a long-time Hindutva icon, might discriminate against the minorities, Adityanath promised there would be no bias for or against anyone.
