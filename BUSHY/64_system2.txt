The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) earlier redid a 5-km stretch of the Juhu beach. 
?According to a plan proposed by BJP legislator Ameet Satam, each of the eight access points to the beach will have 5m high walls, bollards to restrict vehicles, ramps and steps with railings, welcome signs and a few lights.  ?
Steps and railings will make the beach accessible for senior citizens,? 
Redeveloping the entrances is a good move but any beautification should not take away the natural feel of the beach,? 
?Satam estimated the redevelopment of the access points to cost Rs80 lakh, under a Rs12-crore Juhu beach tourism plan. 
Of the eight points, Birla Lane, Military road, Granth lane and Silver beach lane have already been redeveloped. ?
