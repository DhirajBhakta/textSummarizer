In an interview to Dainik Bhaskar, Kapil cleared the air surrounding his ill health and said that he merely has blood pressure problems, not depression.According to several rumours floating around since past few months, Kapil has been under a lot of stress due to the falling TRPs of his show, The Kapil Sharma Show. ?
Apart from low blood pressure, I am not at all facing any health issues. 
For the past few months, I was juggling my time between The Kapil Sharma Show and my film, Firangi. 
Now, I have changed my routine and my health is completely fine,? 
Believe me or not, I get to hear such kind of news from the media people itself.
