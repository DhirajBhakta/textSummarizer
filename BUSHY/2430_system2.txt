A newly-developed hands-free musical instrument that now allows people to make music with their minds is bringing a new meaning to ?
The Encephalophone is a musical instrument that you control with your thoughts,? 
I thought it would be great to use a brain-computer instrument to enable patients to play music again without requiring movement.?
The Encephalophone can be controlled via two independent types of brain signals: either those associated with the visual cortex (ie closing one?
s eyes), or those associated with thinking about movementThe Encephalophone is based on brain-computer interfaces using an old method, called electroencephalography, which measures electrical signals in the brain. 
Scientists first began converting these signals into sounds in the 1930s and, later, into music in the 1960s.
