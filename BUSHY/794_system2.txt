Roger Federer, who recently lifted his 19th Grand Slam champion at the age of 35 by winning a record eighth Wimbledon title, has insisted that it would be a joke if he wins third slam this year at the US Open.Federer has had a sparkling 2017, having emerged victorious in five tournaments including his fifth Australian Open title in January. 
That would be a joke, if I won three slams this year out of nowhere. 
I know if I stay in shape, there are chances for me to do well at the US Open, but to win it? 
m not sure I can win three slams in one year.
