The Aadhaar hearing in the Supreme Court is fast turning into a right to privacy raised by the "elite" class versus right to life for millions of poor in the country. 
Strongly backing the Aadhaar scheme, the Modi government on Wednesday submitted before the Supreme Court that the right to life of millions of poor in the country through food, shelter and welfare measures was far more important than privacy concerns raised by the elite class. 
Controversially, Attorney General K K Venugopal arguing for the Centre also stated that privacy claims required better priority in developed countries "not in a country like India where a vast majority of citizens don't have access to basic needs". 
Biometric details for aadhaar is essential for saving prople from animal existence", Venugopal told a nine-judge bench which is deciding whether right to privacy should be declared a fundamental right. 
At one point, Justice D Y Chandrachud, who was part of the bench, interjected the AG saying privacy is not an elitist concern and it is equally applicable to the large masses. 
Privacy is just one specie like right to have passport, right not to be handcuffed they are various specie of public liberty", argued Venugopal.He also reminded the bench that "world bank has said all countries must follow aadhaar- like model".'
Puttaswamy, and social activist Aruna Roy against making the cards mandatory for accessing government schemes and subsidies.They argued that the manner in which biometric information is extracted violates and transgresses individual rights of citizens including privacy.The PILs had said the manner in which biometric details are collected by private contractors and NGOs hired by UIDAI without any safeguard makes them prone to misuse.
