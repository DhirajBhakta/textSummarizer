The new 12-sided ?1 coin will enter circulation on 28 March and the old-style coin will be defunct by mid-October, the Treasury has announced.The government is launching a campaign to encourage the public to return the round coins. 
The new coin will be the most secure in the world, it is claimed, with several security features, including a hologram.David Gauke, the chief secretary to the Treasury, said: ?
This was withdrawn in March 1988, but is still redeemable at the Bank of England.The Royal Mint will make more than 1.5bn of the new coins, whose design is based on the threepenny bit, which went out of circulation in 1971.
