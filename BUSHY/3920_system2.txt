Boeing said it made the investments in the startup through the ventures arm of a new group called Boeing HorizonX, an innovation cell focused on accelerating potentially transformative aerospace technologies, manufacturing innovations and emerging business models. 
"As a company that is also deeply committed to innovation in sustainable travel, we believe that Zunum and its quiet, environmentally friendly aircraft will light up a vast network of underutilised airports and reinvent regional travel," JetBlue said. 
In a statement, Boeing HorizonX vice president Steve Nordlund said Zunums hybrid electric technology was leading the way in the up-and-coming segment, according to the Business Insider report.
