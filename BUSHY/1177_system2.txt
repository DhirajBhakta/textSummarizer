The Valentine's Day which is better known as the day of international love, attracts a lot of hate organisations who find different ways and means to harass the young couples celebrating their love on different locations. 
On the eve of Valentine's day Bajrang Dal has warned the youth to stay away from celebrating Valentine's Day in any form. 
Just like every year, this year also moral policing will take place on 14th of Feb, where youth will be facing harassments on celebrating the occasion. 
Bajrang Dal activists do not believe in celebrating Valentine's Day, rather according to them it is against the Indian culture.This is not the first time that such warnings have been given to the youngsters, even last year the activists of this organisation assaulted and misbehaved with the youth on celebrating valentine's day.The activists believe that this is not Indian culture rather it is foreign culture that has been adapted by Indians which need to be stopped. 
They also believe that this occasion is destroying the young minds.In the past, the Bajrang Dal activists caught many couples from public places on the V-day and attacked them. 
Many shops were vandalised who were selling Valentine's Day merchandise.Bhupesh Kumar Nayak, the coordinator of the Bajrang Dal in Bhubaneswar directly warned the couples, as they would perform marriage of young lovers whoever found venturing into parks, malls or other public places.
