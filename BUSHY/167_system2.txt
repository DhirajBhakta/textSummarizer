Even as chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh and his government in Punjab claim that their drive against drugs has been a huge success ever since the Congress came to power in March, party MLA Surjit Dhiman said on Monday that ?
Though CM Amarinder Singh had promised to eradicate drugs and gangsters, the government remained active only for 15 days. 
When we formed government, we hoped drug smugglers and gangsters would be behind bars soon. 
The drug menace is the main hurdle to fulfilling the dreams of Udham Singh. 
We have controlled 90% of drugs and the remaining 10% will be wiped out soon.
