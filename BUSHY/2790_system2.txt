4,500 crore.
After a sustained campaign against black money stashed abroad, the Indian government's efforts seemed to have bore fruits as the money parked by Indians in Switzerland's banks is now down by nearly half.According to the latest data published today by Switzerland's central banking authority SNB (Swiss National Bank), deposit by Indians is down to 676 Swiss francs, which comes to about Rs 4,500 crore in 2016.This is a record low for filthy rich Indians who have been accused of keeping black money stashed behind Swiss bank's famed secret walls.The issue of black money has been a matter of big debate in India and Switzerland has been long perceived as one of the safest havens for the illicit wealth allegedly stashed abroad by Indians.
