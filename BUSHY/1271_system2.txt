Tamil Nadu's ruling AIADMK is locked in an ugly war within as acting Chief Minister O Panneerselvam has vowed to stay put in office while party General Secretary VK Sasikala Natarajan accused him of trying to split the party with the opposition DMK's backing.A night after Panneerselvam revolted against Sasikala, who had been elected the AIADMK legislature wing leader, the long-time confidante of former Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa accused Panneerselvam of "betrayal" after he refused to back her plans to head the government.On his part, Panneerselvam announced that a Supreme Court judge will head a Commission of Inquiry to probe the December 5 demise of Jayalalithaa. 
He said there were many questions over the death.Both camps claim majority support among the AIADMK's 134 legislators in Tamil Nadu, with reports saying most of them have been bussed away to a hotel near the Chennai airport.
