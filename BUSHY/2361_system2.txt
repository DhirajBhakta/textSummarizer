Soni Razdan is proud of daughter, actor Alia Bhatt?
With hits such as Udta Punjab, Kapoor and Sons, and Dear Zindagi, she believes that Alia?
We [Soni, Alia?
As her mother, I am always there, but Alia knows what she wants both professionally and personally,? 
A post shared by Soni Razdan (@sonirazdan) on May 21, 2017 at 11:54pm PDTSo which film did she like Alia best in? 
I enjoyed most of her films be it Highway (2014), 2 States (2014) or Udta Punjab (2016). 
But if you ask me to choose the ones I loved, I would say she impressed me with her performances in Udta Punjab, Highway and Dear Zindagi (2016). 
But as I always say an actor is never bigger than her role. 
Also, what I liked is that in each of these films, Alia was different.
