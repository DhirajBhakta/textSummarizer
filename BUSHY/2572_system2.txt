demand for using alternative technology instead of GPS in low cost mobiles, while the industry warned that the decision will push up prices of such feature phones by over 50%.     
GPS is the main tool regarding location details of the subscriber in emergency, so government has decided to implement it in all the mobile phone handsets from 1 January 2018 in a positive manner,? 
In the view of above, it is re-iterated that all mobile phone handset manufacturers should also adhere for second part of the gazette notification dated 22-04-2016 for implementation of GPS facility in all mobile phone handsets ...,? 
ICA, which represents majority of mobile phone companies in India, has written to the government to use A-GPS technology which can help in locating callers using mobile towers near their location.     
DoT has said however that the method used for locating caller with help of mobile towers is not very accurate.     
It said that the GPS has been mandated in all mobile handsets ?
In a letter to the government last year, ICA had said feature phones retail for Rs 500-700 for which bill of material (BOM) used is to the tune of $ 5 (around Rs 330- 350).     
Adding GPS in such phones will increase the production cost to $ 9-11 per unit, it said.
