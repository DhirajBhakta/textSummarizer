Over the same period, Christians gained just an extra year and Jews less than half a year.Among religiously unaffiliated adults, the youngest had an extra 2.9 years in school, overtaking Christians for the number of school years for this age group.Pew found similar changes when looking at the educational gender gap. 
Although overall a much higher proportion of women had received no formal education, and those that had generally spent fewer years in school, the gap was shrinking with successive generations.But among Hindus, there was still an 18-point gap between the youngest men and women, with 38% of women having no formal education compared with 20% of men.The gender gap among the youngest Muslims was 10 points, with 33% of women not going to school compared with 23% of men.The religiously unaffiliated had closed the gap within three generations, although there were still 2% of men and women having no formal education.In higher education, Jews strikingly reversed the gender gap. 
Christians and the religiously unaffiliated also reversed gaps but to a lesser extent.The report emphasises the difference in education between people in economically developed areas and those in poorer, less developed ones, regardless of religion.
