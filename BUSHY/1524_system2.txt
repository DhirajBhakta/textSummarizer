Now, I have no information on who specifically they have been looked at or asked for but I know we have a very strong relationship and there has been several meetings between the NSA and our NSA and other organisations in the UAE and within that framework, within the legal framework, within the agreement there will be a final understanding.Q: Because there are also reports that UAE had cracked down and confiscated some of the properties. 
I don't think any action can be taken against anyone without that legal process, without the jurisdiction process.Q: But if you find substance in India's evidences against Dawood Ibrahim, the UAE will act?
