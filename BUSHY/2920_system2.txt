In an interview to DNA, when Salman was asked about superstardom, he said, "Today, when they say (superstars) I think there is Aamir, Shah Rukh, me, and Akshay Kumar. 
We do fewer films - I do two films a year, Aamir does one film in three years, Akshay does four-five films a year. 
Salman is a huge admirer of Khiladi Kumar and said that he works more than any of the Khans in Bollywood, and therefore, he truly deserves the tag of a superstar. 
Akshay is known to do 3-4 films a year, while Salman mostly sticks to 1-2 films. 
Talking about doing less films than Akshay, the Wanted actor said, "I think Akki is the only one who understood that back in the day, char-paanch lakh ke liye itni jyaada mehnat kar rahe the, ab crores ke liye utni mehnat nahi kar rahe hain. 
On the work front, Akshay will be next seen in Toilet Ek Prem Katha, while Salman is awaiting the release of Tubelight.
