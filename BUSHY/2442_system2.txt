After the appointment of Zaheer Khan and Rahul Dravid as consultants with the Indian team created a storm in the media, the Cricket Advisory Committee (CAC) members have taken up the matter with Committee of Administrators (CoA) and BCCI, asking them to clarify the impression created against their intentions to appoint the two alongside chief coach Ravi Shastri.The three members of the CAC, Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly and VVS Laxman, have written separate letters to Vinod Rai, the head of the COA, and Amitabh Choudhary, the acting secretary of the BCCI.READ?
There have been suggestions that the CAC has exceeded its ambit in going with Mr Khan and Mr Dravid, and these two legends of Indian cricket have been foisted on the head coach. 
We also bring to your notice the mail you had circulated to us saying that we had absolutely free hand in picking the coach of the Indian cricket team.
