Mumbai, Jun 21 (PTI) Actor Arjun Rampal, whose film "Daddy" is based on the life of Arun Gawli, says the movie is not an attempt to glorify the life of the gangster-turned- politician. 
The actor says he is not glorifying Gawli on screen and is presenting his life story the way it is. 
The actor does not believe that he has taken a risk by making a biopic on a gangster rather than opting for an achievers life as is the norm in Bollywood. 
Every film is a risk as the idea or story might sound interesting but it can either go right or wrong," he says.
