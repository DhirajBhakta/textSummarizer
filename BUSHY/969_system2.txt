Two Peruvian brothers are recovering in hospital in the Chilean city of Antofagasta after being doused with petrol and set alight by a mob of Chilean fishermen in the port city of Tocopilla. 
The two brothers had collected seaweed in the region for five years, helping to supply a multimillion-dollar aquaculture export industry. 
The incident took place amid an increasingly heated debate over the recent surge in migration to Chile, mainly from other Latin American and Caribbean countries, and growing racial tensions in the Antofagasta region. 
According to Elizabeth Andrade, a Peruvian social worker and one of the leaders of a migrant squatter camp in the city of Antofagasta, the attack was triggered by competition between seaweed collectors. 
The brothers had received threats over the last few months and were in the process of clearing out their hut to leave Tocopilla when they were set upon, Andrade said. 
In recent years, 64 camps have sprung up around the city of Antofagasta.
