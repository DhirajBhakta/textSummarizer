To circumvent the  500-metre liquor ban on pubs, bars and restaurants, the developers in Gurgaon are changing the entrance to their properties; making  motorable distance more than 500 metres and moving these establishments out of the purview of the Supreme Court?
The excise department, meanwhile, said the process to measure the motorable distance of the bars and pubs will begin on Wednesday. 
Liquor sales at bars and pubs in Cyber Hub and Ambience mall are major crowd pullers and generate huge revenue for these properties. 
The bar/pub owners in Sector 29 also want HUDA to block entry to one of the roads so that the motorable distance can be increased. ?
said a bar owner, preferring anonymity. 
HC Dahiya, excise commissioner, west Gurgaon, said that the motorable distance from the edge of the road will be the criteria for renewal of licences.
