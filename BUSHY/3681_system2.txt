Two days before the Delhi MCD elections, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal lashed out against BJP and Congress and appealed to the people not vote for them. 
He said that, "BJP is in MCD for the last 10 years but still it cannot clean Delhi. 
And if you vote BJP, then in the coming 5 years, there will be so much garbage in Delhi that people will have dengue and chikungunya."
While talking about Congress, Kejriwal said, "Congress has lost its hold over the country and is finished in Delhi. 
I want to tell the people of Delhi that BJP and Congress workers have stolen oil from 70 places, and at many places they have put cement in sewer pipelines because of which water is flowing on roads at some places. 
Among them, over 1.10 lakh people will be exercising their franchise for the first time.Also read: Delhi MCD election: Ruling AAP survey claims it's winning, ABP News-C Voter opinion poll gives it to BJP
