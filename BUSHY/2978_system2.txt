Posters have been put up outside the Aam Aadmi Party office in Delhi calling for the ouster of party leader Kumar Vishwas, accusing him of being a traitor and indulging in anti-party activities.The posters thank Dilip Pandey, who quit as convenor of the party's Delhi unit in April following AAP's defeat in MCD polls, accuse Vishwas of colluding with the BJP and backstabbing party leaders.Earlier this week, Pandey hit out at the poet-politician, asking why he was openly abusing Congress while going soft on Rajasthan Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje. 
The Aam Aadmi Party top brass is unhappy with Vishwas after he asked the party's volunteers in Rajasthan not to stay in five-star hotels and farmhouses.AAP's newly-appointed national treasurer Deepak Bajpai also took on Vishwas on Thursday after the latter accused party leaders of squandering funds by staying in five-star hotels and farmhouses during Punjab and Goa elections. 
In a swipe at Vishwas, Bajpai said, "By the way, the party is looking for a leader who, during his campaign in Goa, stayed in a room with a view in 5-star hotel JW Marriott." 
While Vishwas is known to be usually staying in five-star hotels during his tours, his aides have defended him saying that he does not use party funds for his stay.
