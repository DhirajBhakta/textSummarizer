Opposing the recent notification of the Centre banning sale of cattle for slaughter in animal markets, which is being widely perceived as beef ban, some activists today organised a beef festival in Mizoram capital Aizawl. 
Remruata Varte, one of the organizers said that the entire state stands together in opposing the 'beef ban' by BJP government at the Centre.Beef is an integral part of the food habits of the people in the region and no one will compromise for the same, Varte said.This of course comes as a big set-back for the BJP leaders who have been camping in the region trying to garner support for impending elections in the state.
