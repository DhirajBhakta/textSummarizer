Recently, in a press conference, Kamal Haasan, while supporting the Malayalam actress, named the survivor's name and tried to justify it. 
We are not supporting her (mentions the name), because she is an actress," said Haasan.When a female reporter corrected Haasan and asked him to not name the victim, he said, "It doesn't matter if I have used the name. 
Don't refer to her as 'a female'," he added.While Kamal was appreciated for his take on women's safety, he was severely criticised for naming the actress' name. 
According to reports, the security has been beefed up at Haasan's residence owing to the protests from the fringe group.The popular Malayalam actress, who has worked in Tamil and Telugu films, was abducted and allegedly molested by a gang of six earlier this February.?
