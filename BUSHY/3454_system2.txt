scrapped New Delhi, May 4 (PTI) An RSS affiliate today sought the sports ministrys intervention for annulment of BCCIs contract with Chinese firm Oppo for sponsoring the Indian cricket team. 
The SJM said Indian cricket team members should not wear clothes bearing the logo of Oppo. 
"This would not only misguide our youth in blindly going for buying Chinese brands but would also place us in a very awkward position and our campaign is likely to get badly affected by this," SJMs national co-convener Ashwani Mahajan said in the letter. 
Therefore the team should not wear the Chinese firms logo, he added. 
The SJM also urged the Modi government to shun Chinese goods and enact a "Buy Indian Act". 
"Chinese goods have invaded Indian markets which is not only killing our domestic production but also has direct negative impact on employment generation efforts made by the government," Mahajan said, adding it has taken shape of an "epidemic".
