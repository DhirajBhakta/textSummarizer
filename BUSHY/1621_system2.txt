Floyd Mayweather has said he will come out of retirement to fight Conor McGregor but only if he gets paid $100m (?82m) and the Irish UFC star is prepared to take a career-high $15m (?12m), plus a minor slice of the pay-per-view revenue.Meanwhile, the 38-year-old Manny Pacquiao, who had been hoping for a rematch with Mayweather, has agreed to defend his WBO welterweight title against a little-known Queensland schoolteacher, Jeff Horn, in Brisbane in April, according to unconfirmed reports in Australia. 
s promoter, Bob Arum, is organising for the Filipino senator.It is the Mayweather-McGregor fight that would create the substantially bigger buzz, however, which says much about the state of boxing and the rise of mixed martial arts. 
m saying right here: Conor McGregor keeps telling everybody he wants the fight ? 
We tried to make the fight. 
s never even made $8m or $9m [for one fight]??
