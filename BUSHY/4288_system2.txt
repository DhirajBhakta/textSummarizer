"I believe responsibility of private sector is as much to encourage these innovations because it is outside sphere of a normal banking arrangement to see innovation being funded and so I believe under the auspices of the President and the Department of Science and Technology (DST) are looking at very important moment in our history," Tata said. 
Tata was speaking at a round-table on start-ups, incubation and financing innovations at the Rashtrapati Bhavan today. 
"It is great privilege and great honour to be here today as someone who is been in the start-up and the ... innovation sector and to be aware that today at the highest level in the country, we are receiving the kind of attention that we should have received many many years ago," Tata said at the concluding day of the Festival of Innovations. 
Tata said start-ups and innovation are recent terms which connote enormous profits, billionaires but people often forget both innovation and start-ups have resulted in products and assistance for common good of man.
