s Shin Bet security service later named the three attackers as Mohammed Ahmed Mohammed Jabareen, 29, Mohammed Hamed Abd Al-Latif Jabareen, 19, and Mohammed Ahmed Mafdal Jabareen, also 19, noting that none had previous security convictions.Police security camera footage, released late on Friday, showed the gunmen approaching two policemen at the gate from within the compound - raising questions about how their weapons were smuggled onto the site.Two men with guns can be seen emerging through the low arched entrance and almost immediately shooting one of the policemen from behind as he is talking to his seated colleague.As other Israeli police pursued the men, a heavy exchange of gunfire took place, startling early-morning worshippers in the central plaza, some of whom recorded the shootout on camera phones.In the immediate aftermath the compound was cleared of visitors and closed, with police announcing that Muslim Friday prayers, usually attended by thousands, would be cancelled for the first time in 17 years.Israel said the site would remain closed until Sunday at the earliest while it continued with security assessments despite calls for it to be reopened.The Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, condemned the attack in a rare phone call to the Israeli president, Benjamin Netanyahu, according to the Palestinian Wafa news agency.Video footage recorded during the attack showed shooting and police running across the central plaza in pursuit of the attackers.At one point, one of the gunmen, who is seen lying on the ground apparently motionless, is seen jumping up, amid a fresh exchange of fire in which he falls.A police spokesman described the beginning of the incident.?
