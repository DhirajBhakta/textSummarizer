By Lalit K Jha ?????????????? Washington, Jun 24 (PTI) Seeking to "roll out a red- carpet welcome" to the Indian Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, US President Donald Trump would host him for a working dinner at the White House on Monday, the first of its kind under this administration. 
"We anticipate that their discussions will be broad- ranging, hitting on a variety of regional and global issues that would seek to advance our common priorities, including fighting terrorism, promoting economic growth and prosperity," the official added. 
Noting that the US is very much interested in facilitating Indias defence modernisation, and helping to enhance its role as a leader in the Asia Pacific, the official said the Trump Administration believes that a strong India is good for the US. 
And last years designation of India as a major defence partner was extremely important, and I think well see a concrete expression of this important designation during this visit," said the senior White House official. 
The Trump Administration, the official said, believes that defence trade strengthens both the countries security, it reinforces the strategic partnership, and it allows their armed forces to cooperate more closely and improve their interaction with one another.
