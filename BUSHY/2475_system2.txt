Rumour has it that Divya Dutta's character in Nawazuddin Siddiqui-starrer Babumoshai Bandookbaaz is based on late Tamil Nadu Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa. 
Divya is playing the main antagonist in the film, Mid-Day reports.Apparently, Divya has been watching videos of the former AIADMK supremo to get into the skin of her character. 
A lot of effort has also been put into her look in the film, since the makers wanted her appearance and mannerisms to be "exactly like Jayalalithaa's," according to a source.However, director Kushan Nandy told the publication that there is no truth to these reports. 
So, the similarities [between Divya's character and Jayalalithaa] begin and end with the fact that she plays a female politician, who is a go-getter. 
Divya is a fine actor. 
The trailer released earlier today, and Divya's character looks intriguing. 
Babumoshai Bandookbaaz is about Babu (Nawazuddin), a contract killer who, in his own words, does "outsourcing" for Yamraj (the Hindu god of death). 
Things become interesting when Babu and his rival get contracts to kill the same 3 people.A new power play begins, after deciding that whichever of the two killers manages to kill two out of three will become the undisputed number 1.
