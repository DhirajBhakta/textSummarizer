Akshay Kumar, whose forthcoming movie Toilet Ek Prem Katha stresses on the importance of building toilets and ending open defecation, hopes the film changes people's mindset about this "taboo topic in Indian society".Akshay said in an interaction with the media, "Talks on toilet are still taboo in India. 
Whether it is Airlift, Rustom, Jolly LLB 2 and even Toilet Ek Prem Katha, Akshay is acting in stories that project realism.Asked if that is a strategy, the National Award-winning actor said, "If you are talking about issue-based stories like Toilet Ek prem Katha, I think being a successful actor by the grace of God, if my association gives the film a better mileage and if the story intrigued me, I do it.
