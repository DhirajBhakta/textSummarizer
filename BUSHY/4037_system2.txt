Congress general secretary Digvijaya Singh committed another blunder by writing "Rahul Gandhi Cabinet" in one of his tweets on March 27.The senior Congress leader committed the gaffe, of course inadvertently, while posting a video by former Congress MP Rajkumari Ratna Singh on Twitter. 
Describing the video, he wrote that Ratna Singh is a daughter of the late Dinesh Singh, who was cabinet minister in Indira Gandhi and "Rahul Gandhi Cabinet".He wrote: "Rajkumari Ratna Singh ex MP is the daughter of Raja Dinesh Singh ji who was a Cabinet Minister in Indira Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi Cabinet."
Singh erroneously wrote "Rahul Gandhi" instead of Rajiv Gandhi. 
Dinesh Singh was a minister in Rajiv Gandhi cabinet.The Congress leader was trolled for his faux pas.Subsequently, he deleted the tweet and replaced it with a new one by making the correction. 
The new one reads:Rajkumari Ratna Singh ex MP is the daughter of Raja Dinesh Singh ji who was a Cabinet Minister in Indira Gandhi and Rajeev Gandhi Cabinet.This is not the first time that Singh has courted controversy due to his slip of finger or slip of tongue. 
It was in reference to the gunning down of Kashmiri terrorist Burhan Wani by the security forces on July 8.Earlier, Singh had invited criticism for addressing slain 9/11 main accused Osama bin Laden as "Osamaji" and Pakistani terrorist Hafiz Saeed as "sahib".
