Even before the row over the order asking cine-goers to stand up before a movie for the National Anthem died down, the Supreme Court Tuesday admitted a plea which said "equal respect and status" should be given to National Song Vande Mataram too. 
"Constituent Assembly of India was empowered by Jawaharlal Nehru in August 25, 1948 by making a statement to alter the words or choose entirely a new song but unfortunately it could not be done and on January 24, 1950 Jana Gana Mana and Vande Mataram both songs were adopted of equal honour with each other and equal status," said the petition filed by Supreme Court lawyer Sanjeev Bhatnagar. 
This was one of the several intervention applications filed by people who opposed to the November 30 order which made it mandatory for all cinema theatres across the country to play the National Anthem during which it was made compulsory for the public to show respect by standing up. 
Agreeing to hear all the plea together on April 18, Justice Misra made it categorical to Bhatnagar that he will not be allowed to delve too much into history and should restrict himself only to legal debate on the issue. 
Remember, we have only one National Anthem and do not propagate theories here," SC told Bhatnagar.
