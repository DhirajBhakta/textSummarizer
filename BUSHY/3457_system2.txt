"The first consignment, Ive got to say, was a little disappointing," PFA chief executive Michael Simonetta said, adding "the fruit had a little bit of blemish on the skin and wasnt as evenly coloured as we expected it to be, so were in the process now of getting it to colour more evenly and then offer it for sale following that." 
The feedback has been okay and the upside for me as a consumer is that it tastes better than the Mexican Keitt (mangoes) that are in the market as well at the moment," he said. 
"The variety Im really excited about, is in a few weeks time well bring in the Alphonso mango which is known as the king of mango," he said.
