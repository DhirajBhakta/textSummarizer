 A day after the district administration and the police, in a joint operation, seized illegally mined sand from two villages of Sikandarpur and Murshadpur, the district magistrate said he was planning to start night patrolling on the floodplains of river Yamuna to curb sand mining. 
If the administration wants to stop sand mining, it should ensure that the police stop supporting the sand mafia,? 
The administration said they get information about sand mining activities from the villagers who live along the Yamuna embankment. ?
The DM has instructed all subdivisional magistrates to prepare a list of those involved in illegal sand mining in their respective areas.
