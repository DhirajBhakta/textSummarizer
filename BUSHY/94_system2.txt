The Maharashtra government on Tuesday admitted that adopting online assessment system  by the University of Mumbai (MU) for evaluating answer papers delayed declaration of results. 
The MU had recently shifted to an online system for assessment of answer papers, which caused a delay in completing the assessment work. 
The NCP leader said the university had failed to meet the July 31 deadline given by the governor Ch Vidysagar Rao for completing assessment work. 
Fadnavis said the online assessment system is the need of the hour and has been adopted worldwide. ?
The government will make sure that the system is implemented smoothly in phases,? 
The governor has now set a new deadline of August 5 to declare the pending 304 results.????
