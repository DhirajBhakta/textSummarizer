Nawaz Sharif led Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz government on Friday presented its fifth budget before the 2018 general elections alloting a total of Rs 4,757 billion expenditure for the next fiscal year. 
According to financial experts, the increase in thedefence budget comes in the light of cross border tensions with India, Afghanistan and Iran.Experts also say that though Pakistan Army has been rooting out terrorism from its own soil, through military operations Zarb-e-Azb, Khyber-I, Khyber-II and now Rad-ul-Fasad, tensions between India and Pakistan have only increased. 
One such attack in September last year killed 18 Indian soldiers and India retaliated with "surgical strikes" on terrorist launchpads in PoK. 
India and Pakistan are also at loggerheads over a China- backed economic corridor that runs through PoK.
