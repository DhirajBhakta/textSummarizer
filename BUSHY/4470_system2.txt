London/New Delhi, Feb 26 (PTI) Global banking giant HSBC has disclosed being probed by tax authorities in India and several other countries, including against its Swiss and Dubai units, for allegedly abetting tax evasion of four Indians and their families. 
Disclosing the "tax-related investigations" in its latest annual report published last week, HSBC further said it has set aside USD 773 million (over Rs 5,000 crore) as a provision for various tax- and money laundering-related matters. 
"Various tax administrations, regulatory and law enforcement authorities around the world, including in the US, France, Belgium, Argentina and India, are conducting investigations and reviews of HSBC Swiss Private Bank and other HSBC companies in connection with allegations of tax evasion or tax fraud, money laundering and unlawful cross- border banking solicitation," it said. 
Giving case-wise details, it further said the Indian tax authorities in February 2015 had issued a summons and request for information to an HSBC company in India. 
"In August 2015 and November 2015, HSBC companies received notices issued by two offices of the Indian tax authority alleging that the Indian tax authority had sufficient evidence to initiate prosecution against HSBC Swiss Private Bank and an HSBC company in Dubai for allegedly abetting tax evasion of four different Indian individuals and/or families and requesting that the HSBC companies show why such prosecution should not be initiated. 
"HSBC Swiss Private Bank and the HSBC company in Dubai have responded to the show-cause notices," it said, but did not disclose the name of the Indian individuals.
