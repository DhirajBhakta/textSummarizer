Ever since Kangana Ranaut's remark on Koffee With Karan sparked off a nationwide debate about nepotism, every B-Towner has something or the other to say about it. 
When Mid-Day asked Priyanka Chopra what she, as someone with no godfather in the industry, felt about nepotism, the actor revealed that she has personally experienced it.Priyanka said, "Every star has their individual journey. 
In mine, I have faced a lot. 
I have been kicked out of films because someone else was recommended to the producer. 
I cried and got over it." 
However, the Dostana actor does not have a bitter taste in her mouth from the experience. 
She added, "There is nothing wrong in being born into a family that has a legacy. 
Star kids have insurmountable pressure of living up to the family name... 
On the work front, Priyanka is gearing up for her big Hollywood debut, Baywatch. 
She will be seen playing the antagonist, Victoria Leeds, in the film, that also stars Dwayne Johnson and Zac Efron.
