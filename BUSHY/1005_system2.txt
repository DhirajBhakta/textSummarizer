 The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) is likely to step up its campaign against Chinese goods in the run up to the Hindu campaign against the Hindu festival Rakshabandhan on August 7 by encouraging traders to not sell Chinese-made Rakhis.Volunteers of the Muslim Rashtriya Manch (MRM), the RSS Muslim wing, burnt Chinese goods in Lucknow. 
The RSS has previously campaigned against Chinese crackers during Diwali and its chief, Mohan Bhagwat, called for a boycott of Chinese goods earlier this year.The Swadeshi Jagran Manch (SJM), an RSS affiliate floated to promote Indian products, will follow up the initiative with a two-day meeting in Gonda from July 29.
