After drawing a lot of flak from former cricketers, Australia opener Matt Renshaw on Thursday finally gave his version of what really transpired on Day 1 of the Pune Test when he was seen leaving the field retired ill in the first session, just 15 minutes before the lunch break. 
(Dry pitch for Pune Test could play into Australia's hands: Shane Warne)"He (Smith) wasn't too thrilled about it but he understands that when you need to go to the toilet, you've got to go to the toilet," Renshaw said."
Renshaw wasn't too sure about the rules and didn't know that he had to retire ill to go off the field in such a scenario."
