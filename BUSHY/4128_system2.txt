The alleged attacker, 22-year-old Ravi Kumar, managed to escape from the spot after the crime, but surrendered at Sangam Vihar police station, said Romil Baaniya, DCP (South-East). 
To keep Ravi away, my daughter recently lied to him that she had entered in a relationship with someone else. 
For the last one week, Ravi had allegedly been confronting Muskan in the street close to her home when she would walk to her workplace. 
When she warned him to keep away, Ravi opened the acid bottle and without any warning tried to force the liquid down my daughter?
said the mother who too received minor burns to her hands because of the acid on her daughter?
