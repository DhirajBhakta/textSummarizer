I had read this script three years back. 
I imagine Bindu in every character. 
Though a lot of thrillers were being offered to me, I wanted a Sriram Raghavan thriller. 
I start shooting it in June. ? Then there's Shubh Mangal Savdhan, a remake of a Tamil film, with Bhumi Pednekar.It is the antithesis of Vicky Donor. 
I am fortunate that I have been a part of two National Award-winning films in five years. 
I am getting good choices being part of boutique management of Yash Raj where they handle a fixed number of actors. 
I started with an unconventional film and I am unconventional in a way.
