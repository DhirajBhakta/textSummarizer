spymaster ?????????????? ?????????????? From Lalit K Jha ?????????????? Washington, May 12 (PTI) Pakistan-based terrorist groups are planning to attack both India and Afghanistan, a top US spymaster has said. 
"Islamabad has failed to curb militants and terrorists in Pakistan," Daniel Coats, Director of National Intelligence told members of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence during a Congressional hearing on Worldwide threats. 
"These groups will present a sustained threat to the United Statess interest in the region and continue to plan and conduct attacks in India and Afghanistan," Coats said. 
In South Asia, the intelligence community assesses that the political and security situation in Afghanistan will almost certainly deteriorate through 2018 even with a modest increase in military assistance by the United States and its partners, he told the lawmakers. 
Afghanistan will struggle to curb its dependence on external support until it contains the insurgency or reaches a peace agreement with the Taliban," he said.
