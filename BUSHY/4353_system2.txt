On March 7, 1987, a quick single nudged through the slips to a Pakistani bowler named Ejaz Fakih took Sunil Manohar Gavaskar from his innings score of 57 to 58 at the Sardar Patel Stadium in rural Motera outside Ahmedabad. 
That run also took Gavaskar to a territory which, never mind the batsman, even cricket itself had never seen. 
Fifty seven to fifty eight sent Gavaskar from 9,999 to the first 10,000th run in Test cricket. 
Non-striker Kiran More says Gavaskar celebrated that moment like he usually didn't do in cricket. 
His head slightly lowered, mid-single, Gavaskar raised his bat in both triumph and celebration. 
When play ended, what he did have though, was contentment, "I would have just been happy with 1,000 runs. 
India did not know it then but Gavaskar was to play only one more Test after Ahmedabad. 
When he retired later that year, the country was in deep gloom: Indian cricket's defender, its most gritty general had gone.
