New Delhi, Apr 27 (PTI) The Election Commission has sought an unprecedented 74,000 paramilitary personnel from the Centre for deployment during the bypoll to the Anantnag Lok Sabha constituency on May 25. 
The EC has conveyed to the Home Ministry that 740 companies of paramilitary forces should be put at its disposal by May 12, official sources said. 
A company comprises around 100 paramilitary personnel. 
The demand seemed unprecedented as the poll body had sought 70,000 paramilitary forces for deployment in the recently concluded Assembly elections in five states, including Uttar Pradesh which has 403 Assembly constituencies and 80 Lok Sabha seats. 
Earlier, the EC had sought 30,000 paramilitary personnel for the bypoll to Srinagar and Anantnag Lok Sabha seats. 
Official sources said that in normal circumstances around 10 companies (1,000 personnel) are deployed in a parliamentary seat during polling. 
The Home Ministry is likely to tell the EC that it would be difficult to arrange such a large number of security personnel in a short span of time and it may seek more time.
