Ryan Reynolds (@VancityReynolds) July 31, 2017The snap is a callback to one of the first photos of Reynolds as Deadpool, the one where he was lying on a rug in front of a huge fireplace.The real name of the character is Neena Thurman and like her mutant name might suggest, she has the ability to alter her luck in situations through telekinetic acts.Reynolds has not been shy about sharing photos from the set of the highly-anticipated sequel, which will also star Josh Brolin as Cable.
