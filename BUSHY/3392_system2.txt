New Delhi, May 10 (PTI) Prime Minister Narendra Modi today launched the integrated case management system of the Supreme Court in the presence of the Chief Justice of India. 
The system will help litigants access data and retrieve information online and will be a step towards a paperless Supreme Court. 
Speaking on the occasion, CJI Jagdish Singh Khehar said he proposes to integrate the system with all the 24 high courts and the subordinate courts.
