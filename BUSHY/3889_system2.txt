A bar in Kerala has come up with an exceptional way to get around the new rule banning alcohol near highways.Aishwarya Restobar in Paravoor, Ernakulam, now has a full-blown maze around the building, much like in Harry Potter and the Goblet of fire (the Triwizard Tournament, duh?).
After the Supreme Court ruled a ban on the sale of liquor within 500 metres of national/state highways, things became difficult for Aishwarya Restobar as it was situated near NH 17. 
The only way to get around this was to take the bar further away from the national highway.Hence, as The News Minute reports, the owner of Aishwarya Restobar built the 250- 300 metre long maze to increase the distance between his bar and the nearest highway.So, technically, the bar is not longer 'situated within 500 metres from the highway???. 
According to TNM, the construction of this maze cost around Rs 2 lakh.However, it is yet to know whether this trick will actually give the bar a free pass from the new liquor ban near highways.Kerala bar's ingenious idea to beat SC order: A twisted maze to the entrance https://t.co/m8Vi3uQVaZpic.twitter.com/oH0XbCcGruAlso read:Liquor ban: Left high and dry, states find ways to bypass order, protect revenue?
