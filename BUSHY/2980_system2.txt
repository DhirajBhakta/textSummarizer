Few hours before the Terrorism and Disruptive Activity (TADA) court was set to sentence the seven accused in the 1993 Mumbai serial blasts on Friday, the Mumbai Police control room received a bomb threat. 
The caller said that a person named Manoj, will be triggering off series of bombs in the city and hung up. 
As soon as the call was cut, the police and crime branch officials launched a search operation to nab the caller and the suspected terrorist. 
The caller also shared the phone number and address of the alleged bomber Manoj, mentioning that he hails from Uttar Pradesh and is a multiple felon. 
Within few hours, the police identified the caller Aditya Nagar alias Abhimanyu, a 27-year-old resident of Jawahar Nagar.
