said the driver Mohammed, who is haunted by guilt at letting the young boy drift away.Human rights organisations had raised alarm about the number of unsolved killings in and around Mosul city and in particular the corpses washing up along the Tigris river. 
he said.Some in the town say the bodies are more Isis victims killed by the last fighters holed up in Mosul, but the Iraqi security forces had blocked the river around 20km outside the city with a floating boom designed to stop fighters sneaking out or reinforcements getting in by water. 
Territory further down river towards Qayyarah has been in the control of Iraqi security forces for months.A soldier guarding a floating bridge connecting Munirah village, around 20km south of Mosul on the western bank, refused to give his name, but appeared to confirm that extrajudicial killings were taking place beside the river.He showed the Guardian a video of himself and other soldiers, dragging a limp body with a bloody face along the edge of the water. ?
