Farmers' suicide is a big political issue in Maharashtra, but dragging the 'dreamgirl of Bollywood' into the row is something what the BJP Lok Sabha MP won't like.This is what happened when Maharashtra Independent MLA Bacchu Kadu courted controversy after he dragged Hema Malini into a row over farmers' suicides."
Hema Malini drinks everyday, but does she commit suicide?" 
Kadu said addressing a press conference in Nanded district.Kadu, who is not new to making controversial statements, while countering the general claims that farmers commit suicide because of their drinking habits said, "75 per cent MLAs, MPs, journalists drink... even Hema Malini drinks heavily... but have they committed suicide?" 
There are various reasons behind it," Priti Gandhi, national executive member of BJP's Mahila Morcha, said.According to reports, over 200 farmers have committed suicide only in the Marathwada region of Maharashtra in the first three months of 2017.
