This valuation was arrived at decades back, and in order to reflect a true picture the company got a reassessment done using the fair value method. 
BSNL -- figured among the top loss making firms with a net loss of about Rs 3,880 crore in the governments Public Enterprises Survey 2015-16 -- initiated the valuation exercise as part of project Vasundhara in April this year. 
"We decided to go for fair valuation of a third of our land parcels...freehold land. 
With this, the fair valuation has been estimated at about Rs 65,000 crore just for one-third of land parcels," he told PTI here.
