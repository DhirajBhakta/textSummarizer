 The Kandivli police booked a man on Thursday for hurting religious sentiments over a comment he made on Facebook against Shiv Sena founder Bal Thackeray. 
While Ahmed Shaikh, a resident of a slum in Kandivli, has not been arrested, he was charged based on a complaint by one Lalsingh Rajpurohit, a builder. 
In his complaint to the police, Rajpurohit said he noticed Shaikh?
While his friend had put a photo of Thackeray and written a post praising the late leader?
Mukund Pawar, senior inspector at Kandivli police station, they will decide on the further course of action only after they investigate further.This is not the first time that police have registered an offence over a Facebook post about Thackeray.
