These things should not happen," the DGP said.Supporting the need for such a squad, Singh said it was necessary to prevent teasing, molestation or harassment of women at public place and instill a sense of security among people.The Allahabad high court in March had upheld Yogi Adityanath government's move to set up these squads but cautioned that the police must act only as per law and not "outside its purview". 
Whoever breaks the law will be dealt with an iron fist," the DGP said.Without naming any party or organisation, Singh said the police are not hesitating to take strong action against the "newly emboldened constituents for their over-enthusiasm" and cited strict action against cow vigilantes and the dealing of Saharanpur riots.Contrary to the view of opposition parties who referred to several incidents of rape, caste violence and 'gau rakshaks' as worsening law and order situation in the state, Singh said the situation had "in fact improved"."
