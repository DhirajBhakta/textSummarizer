?A post shared by Priyanka Chopra (@priyankachopra) on May 30, 2017 at 1:04am PDTMany Facebook users critcised her for forgetting her roots because she was wearing a "western dress" in front of an Indian prime minister. 
FYI: Modi was not wearing a khadi kurta pajama when he met German Chancellor Angela Merkel. 
Priyanka was dissed for sitting in front of the PM cross-legged as apparently it is a disrespectful posture (important note for young ladies).Also read: Priyanka Chopra slammed for being insensitive towards refugees and immigrants because of her T-shirtThe users advised her to cover her legs, wear either a salwar kameez or saree, and basically just be 'decently' dressed as that is the only way she can be respectful towards the prime minister.? Apparently, it was a matter of "common sense" which Priyanka allegedly lacks because she did not cover her legs.
