Borussia Dortmund defender Marc Bartra has said he experienced the "hardest 15 minutes" of his life after fracturing his wrist in Tuesday's attack on the team bus.The 26-year-old had an operation after breaking the radial bone in his arm when three explosions went off as the bus made its way to the stadium shortly before Dortmund's Champions League clash with AS Monaco. 
The accompanying photo showed Bartra looking towards his family. 
He had a cast on most of his right arm and around his left wrist.Dortmund said on Thursday that Bartra, who joined the club for 8 million euros ($8.50 million) from Barcelona at the start of the season, should return to playing in "about four weeks".Tuesday's match was rescheduled for 24 hours later and Monaco secured a 3-2 victory over Dortmund, who will next host Eintracht Frankfurt in the Bundesliga on Saturday.German newspaper Bild said on its website that Dortmund's stadium programme for the weekend game featured a message from the club's chief executive Hans-Joachim Watzke saying: "Like on Wednesday evening in the game against Monaco, we're not playing just for ourselves today."
"And of course we're also playing for Marc Bartra, who wants to see his team win!"
