Days after a Rajasthan High Court judge said that peacocks do not have sex and peahens get pregnant by drinking the tears of peacocks, the number of visitors at Choolannur sanctuary in Palakkad, Kerala, has gone up.People are queuing up at the Choolannur pea fowl sanctuary to see if and how tears of peacocks can impregnate peahens.Since Rajasthan High Court judge Mahesh Chandra Sharma made the startling comment on May 31 and set the social media on fire, the sanctuary in Palakkad has witnessed the average number of daily visitors going up from a measly 10-12 to 200-300 in the last fortnight.SHOWING VISITORS THE REAL PICTUREThe authorities at the Palakkad sanctuary, however, have taken it upon themselves to educate people about the mating habits of peacocks and show them the 'real' picture.Officials at the sanctuary show videos on mating pattern of peacocks to inquisitive visitors and tell them that unlike what the Rajasthan High Court judge said, peacocks mate just like any other bird.Forester T G Babu explains to visitors how exactly do peacocks mate with peahens: "The peacocks spread their feathers and strut around the peahen. 
Once the peahen shows her willingness, the peacock mounts on the peahen and fertilises the eggs through muscular spasms".The Choolannur sanctuary has close to 300 pea fowls. 
It was established in 2007 and named after famous ornithologist Induchoodan or K K Neelakantan.These days, the sanctuary has become a school for those who want to learn about the mating habits of peacocks.
