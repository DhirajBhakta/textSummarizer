New Delhi, Dec 8 (PTI) Dismissing the petition against demonetisation, Karnataka High Court has upheld certain restrictions that accompanied the decision saying they are matters for central government and RBI to decide. 
In his order, Justice Ashok B Hinchigeri observed that "laudable objectives" to tackle the menaces of fake currency notes, black money and terrorism cannot be achieved without imposing restrictions. "...but in a situation of this nature, no directions, much less time-bound directions, can be given to the government of India and the RBI," he said. 
The order was issued by the Karnataka High Court in a writ petition seeking removal of cap on withdrawal imposed by government and RBI following demonetisation of Rs 500/1000 currency notes effective November 9. 
"In the larger interests of the society, when a comprehensive mission is being accomplished, certain regulatory measures during the period of transition are bound to affect the interests of some sections of people," the order said. 
"As and when the difficulties are noticed in the course of implementing the policy, the necessary remedial measures have to be taken," it said.
