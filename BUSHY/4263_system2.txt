After suffering a crushing defeat in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections, SP chief Akhilesh Yadav and party partron Mulayam Singh Yadav on Sunday met party workers and leaders and asked them to reach out to the people and strengthen the outfit.During the meet, Akhilesh told partymen that Samajwadi Party was not only a party, but an ideology, and that "our struggle will continue." 
"You all should reach out to people and strengthen the party again. 
I will review party's performance and analyse the results. 
A meeting of all the party candidates and MLAs will be held next week after which we will devise our new strategy," he said.The Samajwadi Party, which got an absolute majority in the 2012 state polls by winning 224 seats, could only win 47 seats this time despite the party's aggressive campaign against its rival BJP.Driven by the Modi wave, the BJP stormed to power in Uttar Pradesh after 14 years, securing three-fourths majority and demolishing rivals SP-Congress and BSP in the keenly-contested Assembly polls.Showing an astonishing performance, the saffron party got 312 seats in the 403-member Assembly.Watch the video here: Also read:
