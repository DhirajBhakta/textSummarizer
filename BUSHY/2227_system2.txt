The South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) is planning to install 100 mobile toilet vans at jhuggis/ slum clusters falling under its jurisdiction, inorder to achieve 100% open defecation-free (ODF) tag. 
Also, there should be provision for toilets within 500 metres of slum settlements.Assuming that these norms would be fulfilled over the period of time, the South Corporation, in May, made its preliminary resolution public and declared 92 of 104 wards open defecation-free. 
We had to request the DUSIB and Railways to speed up construction of toilets and if there is no land, they should approach other agencies,? 
said a senior official.But since the implementation of this was taking time, the agency decided to place mobile toilets. ?
