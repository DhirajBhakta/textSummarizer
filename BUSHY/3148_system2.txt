The waters of Venice got a new installation on May 13 and guess what? 
It was?a set of two enormous hands, emerging out of a canal to support the historic Ca'Sagredo hotel.This huge pair of white hands has actually been put on display as part of the 2017 La Biennale di Venezia, an annual exhibition.Titled 'Support', the sculpture has been created by renowned artist Lorenzo Ouinn. 
Built off-site, the hands were then loaded on boats and carried to their present location by Quinn and his team. 
The hands are approximately 9m in height (27ft) and weigh approximately 2500kgs each (5,800lbs, informs Quinn through his Insta post. 
Quinn writes on his Instagram page that Support will preserve Venice, ''the wonder of city that is threatened by climate change.''
The sculpture was made in Quinn's Bracelona studio, using the ancient method of lost-wax casting, out of recyclable materials post which it was painted.
