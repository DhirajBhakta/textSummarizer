A group of workers from Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) have recently started a campaign to get anti-corruption activist Anjali Damania back in the party.Damania has been responsible for exposing irrigation scam as well as Maharashtra Sadan scam that saw Nationalist Congress Party leader Chhagan Bhujbal being put in jail. 
A well-known face in Maharashtra, Damania quit the AAP in 2015 following allegations levelled against the party leadership. 
The volunteers have asked Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal to convince Damania to return. 
AAP then did not contest the Assembly polls and in September 2014 Damania resigned from the post of party?
Damania said she has not taken any decision on rejoining AAP. ?
