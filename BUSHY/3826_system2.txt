The judges on the FGCM aren't required to possess law degrees.HOW IT HAPPENED WITH KULBHUSHAN JADHAVPakistan Army General Qamar Javed Bajwa confirmed the death sentence to Kulbhushan Jadhav after the Field General Court Martial found him guilty of "all the charges".An ISPR release said, "The spy was tried through Field General Court Martial under the Pakistan Army Act and awarded the death sentence. 
The government can also transfer cases to the military courts of Pakistan.The Pakistan government gave an extension to the military courts of Pakistan after the December 2015 terror attack on a Peshawar school.Interestingly, the military courts of Pakistan do not have trained judges or judges with any kind of mandatory legal training.According to existing laws in Pakistan, the military court convicts cannot appeal in a civilian court. 
However, the chances of getting a different verdict are slim.- The second option available to Kulbhushan Jadhav is to appeal in a civilian court for 'review' of the FGCM judgment. 
According to the Pakistan Army Act Section 7.2.3, military court convicts can have the decisions 'reviewed' by civilian courts, where Kulbhushan can have a lawyer of his choice. 
The government of India can also find a lawyer to defend him if Pakistan gives Kulbhushan Jadhav consular access.HOW MILITARY COURTS OPERATE IN PAKISTANThe human rights activists of Pakistan have questioned the very existence of military courts especially for trial of civilians. 
According to the International Court of Justice, Pakistan is the only South Asian country to allow trial of civilians by military courts.The principle of fair justice warrants a written judgment by a court of law. 
Kulbhushan Jadhav's confession was one of them.The unusually high percentage of confession to crimes by the accused in military courts raises serious doubts about the credibility of the statements.
