Pakistan batsmen weren't aggressive enough while the bowlers looked jaded, contributing to a whitewash in the three-Test series against Australia, chief selector Inzamam-ul-Haq has said."
First of all we couldn't play well under pressure and twice our batsmen failed to hold their nerve for even two sessions of the day which is quite unfortunate," he said, as quoted by Pakistan daily Dawn on Sunday."
Our key batsmen like Younis Khan, Asad Shafiq and others just played a couple of good knocks in the three Test series and only Azhar Ali was consistent with more good knocks. 
As for Misbah, he failed to play even a single good innings," rued Inzamam. 
Our main bowlers have been playing regularly in the last three series and the fatigue could have affected their performance," he added.Reliance on spinner Yasir Shah has been excessive, another factor in Pakistan's losses."
But he failed miserably in Australia and generally all our bowlers conceded too many runs," the former right-hand batsman pointed out."
