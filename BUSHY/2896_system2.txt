Washington, Jun 23 (PTI) Inspired by the nanostructures found on moth eyes, scientists have developed a new anti- reflection film that could allow people to read from their smartphones and tablets even in bright sunlight. 
The film exhibits a surface reflection of just 0.23 per cent, much lower than the iPhones surface reflection of 4.4 per cent, for example. 
Reflection is the major reason it is difficult to read a phone screen in bright sunlight, as the strong light reflecting off the screens surface washes out the display. 
"Using our flexible anti-reflection film on smartphones and tablets will make the screen bright and sharp, even when viewed outside," said Shin-Tson Wu from the University of Central Florida in the US. 
"In addition to exhibiting low reflection, our nature- inspired film is also scratch resistant and self-cleaning, which would protect touch screens from dust and fingerprints," said Wu, who led the study published in the journal Optica. 
The coating can also be used with flexible display applications such as phones with screens that fold like a book, which are expected to hit the market as soon as next year. 
Many of todays smartphones use a sensor to detect bright ambient light and then boost the screens brightness level enough to overcome the strong surface reflection.
