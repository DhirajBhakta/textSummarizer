Kolkata, Mar 29 (PTI) The Censor Board regional office has stalled the release of Bengali film "Shunyota" themed on the effects of demonetisation on the common man and referred it to CBFC Chairman for future decision. 
Director Suvendu Ghosh claimed that "Shunyota" is the first film on demonetisation, and is scheduled to be released on March 31. 
Addressing a press conference, Ghosh today said, "I have learnt that CBFC members are not sure in which category they should slot the film. 
If they had any issue, they could have given U/A to the film. 
My three-part film does not take any stand on the demonetisation issue. 
"I feel the jury members of CBFC may be esteemed persons in their respective fields, but having knowledge over films is very crucial to decide on a film," he said.
