Five people have been booked and two of them arrested by Navi Mumbai Police for stopping a tempo which was carrying meat despite the fact that the driver had a certificate to show that it was not beef, but buffalo meat being transported legally.The incident took place late on Monday night. 
?Despite the fact that the tempo driver had a certificate to prove that he was carrying buffalo meat as part of a legal consignment (and it was not beef), these people insisted that the driver pay fine and destroy the consignment. 
The results of the test the next morning confirmed it as buffalo meat and legally valid to be transported.The police allowed the tempo driver to travel with his consignment while five people were booked for giving false information and stopping such a consignment.Last week, India Today-Aajtak carried out a sting operation on gau rakshaks from Mumbai and Maharashtra exposing the extortion racket they were running.
