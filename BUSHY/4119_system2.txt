Several people, mostly labourers working in the university, queue up with containers near the freak neem tree for their daily fix. 
said Mahesh Prasad, the head gardener of North Campus.There are around 15 neem trees near the rugby stadium towards the back end of the campus, most of which are more than 50 years old. 
But only one tree is giving out the sap ? 
The strong beer-like scent can be smelled at least 10 feet, or even more, from the tree. 
As it is a neem tree, I think, it also has some medicinal properties,? 
The microbe is helping the tree sap to ferment,?
