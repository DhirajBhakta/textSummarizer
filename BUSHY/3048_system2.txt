Racing against time to bring a network of "high-speed corridors" on track, the Indian Railways is exploring self-propelled train sets similar to those used in Delhi Metro.This technology, experts say, will not only achieve faster acceleration of up to 160 km per hour, but also put in place advance protective measures like electro-pneumatic braking system to improve passenger safety.Senior railway officials said the prototype of the train is being manufactured at Integral Coach Factory in Chennai and the first two sets will be ready by March 2018. 
The brake system will be Electro Pneumatic, which will reduce the braking distance, so that full speed potential of the train can be harnessed," the officials said.The new technology, which comprises electro-pneumatic (EP) brake system, has an edge over the conventional air brake mechanism in terms of speed of control and quick on-vehicle reaction times.The EP brake takes less time to respond giving the loco pilot instant control of the entire train. 
This includes removing sharp curves and barricading along the route so that trains can attain high speed without any physical obstructions.MODI'S DREAM PROJECTA network of high speed corridors is the dream project of Prime Minister Narendra Modi but so far only Delhi-Agra corridor has become operational.
