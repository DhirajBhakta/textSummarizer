Uber hikes ride time charges by up to 50% in Delhi NCR.
App-based cab aggregator Uber has hiked fares of its entry and premium level services by up to 50% in Delhi-NCR.The US-based firm has increased ride time charge to Rs1.5 per minute from Rs1 earlier for its UberGO and UberX services. The transportation app charges Rs6 per kilometre up to 20km and Rs12 per km thereafter at a base fare of Rs40 for UberGO. While the revised fare irked users who sought the intervention of the Centre and the Delhi government, many were left confused. Uber seems to be fooling us. On the one hand, it says that its base fare is Rs40 and on the other, it charges us a minimum fare of Rs60. On top of that, now they have increased the ride time, said Pooja Shah, an IT professional who regularly uses Uber cabs to tavel to and from work.Starting January 5, 2017, we have made some changes to our pricing structure in Delhi-NCR in order to serve the city better, an Uber spokesperson said.The move made many feel the need for a policy that would guide such companies. There should be a policy to guide app-based cab providers. They are enjoying monopoly and flouting all rules. At present, they are not bound by any rules and surge pricing is still levied on us, said Ajay Anand, another regular user.Last year, Uber had introduced upfront fare under which the company calculates and shows rates depending on expected time and distance of travel and local traffic. The fares fluctuate due to demand.The company, which operates in 29 Indian cities, counts India as its second largest market, after the US. Affordable pricing has been one of the important factors driving the uptake of on-demand taxi services in the country.
