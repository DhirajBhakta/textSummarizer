Delhi BJP chief Tiwari has breakfast with slum dwellers.
Delhi Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) chief and MP Manoj Tiwari today had breakfast with slum dwellers of Samaypur Badli. Accompanied with Leader of Opposition Vijendra Gupta, he visited the slum and had his morning meal at a resident's house."Breakfast is just a gesture, I am making notes about the problems of the area. The slums are deprived of water, sewage and toilets. I have observed that 98 per cent of slums' problems are related to Delhi government," said Tiwari.Tiwari had a simple breakfast comprising rice, lentil, vegetable and salad- at a shanty of Shyam Kumar, a resident of Samaypur Badli. Hundreds of slum dwellers gathered at Kumar's place to catch a glimpse of the Delhi BJP chief. On Arvind Kejriwal's repudiating stance on MCD election result, Tiwari added,"What work is he talking about... Work is here where I am standing (in the slums)... Work cannot be done from air conditioned rooms."He also requested the Delhi Chief Minister to join him in making slums a better place to live.
