Pic of SRK, Salman from upcoming film's set surfaces online.
It was only recently that the news of Salman Khan doing a cameo in Aanand L Rai's next with Shah Rukh Khan started doing the rounds. After SRK agreed to make a special appearance in Salman's Tubelight, the Bajrangi Bhaijaan actor decided to return the favour by agreeing to be a part of a dance sequence in the yet-to-be-titled film. And the 51-year-old actor has already begun shooting for the part with friend Shah Rukh Khan. A picture of the two Khans along with filmmaker Aanand L Rai has surfaced on the internet. According to a report in Mumbai Mirror, Salman joined friend Shah Rukh on the sets of the film, and the two discussed the shot. TIGER ROARING... #SalmanKhan spotted on set of #SRK and Aanand L Rai's next shooting for a song at #mehboobstudio (July 4th 2017) ! tmblr.co/ZrXcGy2NST0_7 #TubeLight #BeingHuman #BeingInTouch #SKF #TigerZindaHai #BollywoodA post shared by SalmanKhanHolics   (@salmankhanholics) on Jul 4, 2017 at 7:12pm PDT A source was quoted as telling the daily, "Salman and Shah Rukh will shoot together over three days. The number is being choreographed by Remo D'Souza, who has taken a break from the city tours of his reality show, Dance Plus 3, to focus on the lavishly-mounted song for which a huge set has been erected. Rehearsals have already kicked off and it will be shot at a suburban studio." From Shah Rukh's role of a dwarf to the hunt for leading ladies, Rai's film has been in the news for quite some time. The much-talked-about film will see SRK reuniting with Katrina and Anushka. But more than anything, it is Shah Rukh's character that has grabbed eyeballs. It is for the first time that the 51-year-old actor will essay the role of a dwarf.
