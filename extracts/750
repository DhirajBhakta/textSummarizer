Women's World Cup win will be bigger than 2011 win: Gambhir.
The Indian women's cricket team is the toast of the nation having defeated favourites Australia in the Women's World Cup semi-final. India's top-scorer of the 2011 World Cup final Gautam Gambhir, currently working as an ESPNcricinfo analyst, reckons if the Mithali Raj-led team can go on to win the big final come Sunday, the victory will be even bigger than the glory men's team achieved at the Wankhede Stadium in 2011."When we won in 2011 it was at home and we were the tournament favourites. But the women won the semi-final against Australia in difficult conditions. They are one step away from the World Cup and if they can win this, it will be bigger than the 2011 World Cup win," he told India Today.Gambhir was equally effusive in praise of the women who made the difference in the semi-final Harmanpreet Kaur."The occasion was very important. There will be other players who will play knocks like that, those who will get bigger runs than her. But it was a World Cup semi-final and against Australia. For a 42-overs game to finish 171 not out was unbelievable, incredible. If it was a 50-overs game who knows she would have got a double ton as well. She did it when India needed it the most and has got India one step away from a World Cup win," he added.The gritty opener floored by Harmanpreet's big match temperament en route her 115-ball unbeaten 171, disagreed with another World Cup winner Ravi Shastri's comparison of her knock with the legendary Kapil Dev's famous 175 in the 1983 World Cup.
