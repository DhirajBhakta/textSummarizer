Rishabh Pant becomes India's youngest T20I debutant.
Hello and welcome to our Live coverage of the third and deciding T20I between India and England in Bengaluru. Stay tuned as we bring you all the latest updates. (LIVE SCORECARD)Virat Kohli: Coming back here after a while. It has been a long time since we played the IPL final. Even after losing all three tosses, we won the series, just like the Test series. It is not a very bad thing to have MS Dhoni behind the stumps. I am new to the limited overs format and I keep taking help. A lot of credit goes to them. Yes, that too and that one over from Jordan to Yuvi. We thought 175-180, but that over took us to 200. Credit to Chahal, he knows the ground better. I have a lot of faith in him and he plays his cricket with confidence. He has to maintain his orginality and it is great to have a guy who has so much zeal. I wanted to send him up, but he is the one to say he will bat down the order. He is a champion player and he is a match-winner. Come to the big game, he stepped up. It is a memorable tour. When we went to England we lost the Test series. It has been a brilliant couple of months for this side. Yuzvendra Chahal: I felt nice playing my first match at Bengaluru for India. I have bowled in the poweplay in the IPL and Virat has the confidence in me to give me the ball. I plan according to how the batsman plays. Even Dhoni used to tell me what the batsman is going to play. Mishy bowled well in the last match as well, looking at him I get the confidence to toss the ball up. Eoin Morgan: We lost two in batsmen and it really hurt us. It was an excellent spell from Chahal. Credit should be given where it is due. India played the better cricket today. Beautiful wicket to bat and we would have taken 190-200 at the beginning. We take a lot of things. The biggest thing is our bowling. We showed improvement in our bowling department. Tonight's batting performance has been our worst in a couple of years. Yuzvendra Chahal wins the Man-of-the-Series award for taking 8 wickets in three matchesYuzvendra Chahal wins Man-of-the-Match award for taking 6/25 Mishra: Chahal and I had worked out where to bowl on this pitch to stop runs.Yuvi: Dhoni and I have good understanding. Tried my best. Bangalore has always been a batting paradise. We put up a very good total and the bowlers bowled very well. 202 was a par score in Bangalore. Great bowling performance by the bowlers. Mishra set the tone today and Chahal was able to get the wickets from the other end.  And it is a wrap! Test series 4-0, ODI and T20I series 2-1 #INDvENG#TeamIndia@Paytmpic.twitter.com/IX9u2vheCkThe Men in Blue have done it again. They have won the series 2-1! They beat England in the Tests, in the ODIs and now in the T20Is. In the series decider, India set a huge target in front of the visitors. It was a great collective batting performance from the hosts. They started with the ball in a great fashion too as they sent packing Billings on a golden duck. Series deciders:ODI vs NZ, 2016: NZ 63/2 to 79 all out. Amit Mishra 5/18T20I vs Eng,2017: Eng 119/2 to 127 all out. Chahal 6/25#INDvENGJason Roy and Joe Root then steadied the ship. The stitched a 47-run partnership in just 29 deliveries for the second wicket. Roy then fell to Mishra. Once again, Morgan came out in the middle and kept England in the run chase. He and Root together put up 64 runs in 43 balls. However, they then started the collapse as a tight over from Mishra which led England needing 86 off 42 deliveries. The pressure got the better off the visiting side as Morgan and Root departed in back-to-back deliveries. It was a horrendous performance from thereon as they lost 8 wickets for 8 runs in the space of 18 deliveries. Buttler who got promoted above Stokes once again failed while Stokes and Ali too couldn't do anything as they had a daunting task ahead of them. 22.17 IST:OUT! Edged and taken! Full and wide outside off, Mills slashes hard but only gets a thick outside edge which goes through the slip cordon. Virat Kohli has stationed himself at wide first slip but does well to get across to his left to take a good catch.

England 123-6 (15.1) 22.04 IST: WICKET! England losing their wickets way quickly now. A short ball outside off, Buttler gets across to pull but gets a top edge due to the extra bounce. The ball goes straight up in the air and Virat Kohli takes a simple catch running to his right from mid off. The promotion of Buttler does not work for England and they now need 84 from 34 balls.22.01 IST: OUT! Two in two for India as Root is trapped in front by Chahal for 42.

That looks so easy on the eyes! 21.23 IST: OUT! MISHRA HAS HIS MAN! Tossed up in the line of the stumps, Roy kneels down and goes for a slog sweep. Gets a top edge instead and the ball balloons high in the air. Dhoni gets under it near the short leg region and collects it easily. The danger man, Roy departs! End of a 47-run partnership!England reach 55-1 off the PowerPlay with Jason Roy 32* & Joe Root 20* - keep going lads! ð??? #INDvENGFollow live: https://t.co/MZ6wQXunehpic.twitter.com/mQV49f0Tnk21.14 IST: ENG 44/1 after 5 overs.

Tossed up on middle and leg, Roy kneels and sweeps it over long leg for a boundary. There were more sixes than fours in Indian innings - 12 vs 11. Has happened only twice before for India in a complete match.#INDvENG21.07 IST: After fielding, Kohli throws the ball at Chahal. He is not alert and instead of whipping the bails off he turns and throws it to the keeper's end. Dhoni doesn't even pick the ball and shouts on Chahal! Roy gets a reprieve! 21.03 IST: Joe Root is the new man in! Only second time 5 Indian batsmen have scored at a SR of 140 (or more) in same innings. Other instance was vs SL (Nagpur, 2009).#INDvENG20.57 IST: WICKET! Quicker one sliding in, Billings looks to play it across the line but yorks himself. The ball goes off the inside edge onto the boots and towards gully. Raina from first slip dives and grabs the ball.20.54 IST: SIX! Tossed up on middle and off, Roy brings out his reverse slog. Slogs it over point for a maximum. 20.51 IST: We are back for the chase! Jason Roy and Sam Billings are the two who have come out to open. Ashish Nehra to begin the proceedings. 203 needed for the victoryHere come Jason Roy & Sam Billings! We need 203 to win the series... go well lads! #INDvENGFollow the chase: https://t.co/MZ6wQXunehpic.twitter.com/NwxcjQVxx0India innings: Right then! England need 203 to win the T20I series. Seems to be a bridge too far. But then this is M.Chinnaswamy where anything is possible. The conditions are not totally against India, with the pitch playing a bit two-paced and the ball stopping on the batsmen a bit. How the bowlers handle the dew will be key. Stay tuned for the run chase. England were very inconsistent tonight. Whether it was the short boundaries, or the dew, one can't say but surely they would not have planned to concede 118 in the last 9 overs. Of those, only two overs went below 10, with the lower value being 8. Tymal Mills and Ben Stokes were impressive, finishing with 1/32 each in their 4 overs while we saw the other side of Chris Jordan tonight, going for 56 in his 4 overs. Strangely, Plunkett bowled just 2 overs with Morgan preferring to bowl 6 overs out of Moeen Ali and Adil Rashid, yielding a total of 53 runs without any wicket.Pandya's run out from the last ball & India finish 202-6 - will we chase it & win the series? #INDvENGFind out ð??? https://t.co/MZ6wQXunehpic.twitter.com/yuSEivZQKHSo India finish on a commanding total. This is the first time a team has crossed the 200-run mark in T20Is at this venue. Did not look like they will do so at the halfway mark but scintillating knocks from Raina and Dhoni made it possible. 20.41 IST: MS Dhoni's maiden fifty (56), Suresh Raina's 63 help India post 202 vs England in 20 oversIt has taken MS Dhoni 10 years & 66 innings to score his maiden T20I fifty- the longest for any player in terms of time & innings.#INDvENG20.41 IST: RUN OUT! Fuller on middle and leg, Pandya clips it through mid-wicket. Stokes the man in the deep, rushes towards the ball and hurls a throw at the striker's end. Buttler collects it and calmly whips the bails off. INDIA FINISH ON 202/6! 20.40 IST: SIX! Jordan once again fails to find his mark and Pandya takes full advantage of it. Lofts it over long on. Roy present there jumps to the fullest, gets hand to it but fails to hold onto it. 20.39 IST: OUT! DHONI DEPARTS! Banged in short, Dhoni is surprised by that and takes his eyes off the ball as he goes for a pull.20.38 IST: FOUR! Low full toss, Dhoni hits it powerfully straight down the ground. There's no long off in place but not sure even he would have stopped it. A boundary is signalled! 20.35 IST: FOUR! That spoils a good over for England! Pant shuffles and scoops the length delivery over backward square leg. Beats Plunkett in the deep is beaten and the ball crosses the ropes. 9 runs off the over! 20.30 IST: OUT! Slower one does the trick for Mills! Yuvraj out for 26. Back of a hand slower one, Yuvraj who has backed long way already, is beaten by the lac of pace on it. He tries to adjust but the ball goes off the leading edge straight into the gloves of Buttler. Timely wicket for England as Yuvraj was looking very threatening. That's end of a superb cameo from Yuvraj! Also, the end of a 57-run partnership! IND 179/4 in 18.3 overs.

IND 153-3 20.18 IST: FOUR! Full outside off, Stokes fails to hit his mark and Dhoni punishes him, drives it powerfully through mid off for a boundary. 20.16 IST: FOUR! Down the leg side, MSD glances it delicately. Gets it past short fine leg and the ball reaches to the fence. Dhoni is using the pace of the bowlers superbly. Second time in 3 deliveries! IND 142/3 in 16 overs20.14 IST: Interesting stat on MS Dhoni by Rajneesh Gupta  Last time MS Dhoni came in to bat in a T20I in 8th over (or earlier) was vs NZ at Nagpur in 2016 & before that in 2012!#IndvsEng#INDvENG20.11 IST: FOUR!

Fifty for Raina off 39 balls Well batted, Suresh Raina - 50 up from from 39 balls. India are 98-2 off 11.5 overs #INDvENGLive blog: https://t.co/MZ6wQXunehpic.twitter.com/U3Qbb9lmZI19.56 IST: SIX!

Replays show that KL Rahul was dismissed on a no ball. It wasn't refereed and Stokes got away with it. Rahul must be disappointed. All evens out at the end of the day. ð??¸ @benstokes38 smashes the ball into Rahul's middle stump! ð??¥India 70-2 (9 overs) #INDvENGpic.twitter.com/mJTTZ4JxCD19.41 IST: OUT! Stokes removes Rahul for 22. Stokes breaks the stand! Shows the values of bowling straight. Rahul was in that mood of attacking every ball and missed this one. He was playing beautifully up until now but for this ball, he just swung wildly. Stokes bowled an off cutter, pitching it on a good length outside off. Rahul was already through his shot even before the ball reached him. It went past the bat and hit the middle stump. The 61-run stand is broken in 37 balls. IND 67/2 in 8 over. Dhoni comes in next WICKET! Bowled him! Ben Stokes makes the breakthrough - KL Rahul goes for 22. India 65-2 #INDvENGFollow LIVE: https://t.co/MZ6wQXunehpic.twitter.com/XYlWI1Vx9i19.34 IST: SIX! COLOSSAL! Flighted outside off, Rahul jumps down the track and sends this miles up in the air and it is out of Chinnaswamy! New ball please! 19.33 IST: Fifty partnership comes up between Raina and Rahul off 35 balls.19.31 IST: SIX! Not sure who is going to reach this one though! A poor ball, down the leg side, on a length, Raina gets across and scoops it well over short fine leg. It lands onto the second tier! Another good over for India, 14 runs off it. IND 53/1 in 6 overs  19.29 IST: SIX! TOP EDGE, BUT SIX! Jordan is smiling, Stokes is smiling, everyone is smiling. How did that happen? That is Chinnaswamy for you. A short ball around middle and leg. Raina goes for the hook but gets a top edge. The ball goes high in the air, Ben Stokes settles himself under it but the ball sails over him! IND 46/1 in 5.2 overs  19.25 IST: FOUR! Terrific placement! A short ball outside off, angling away from the batsman, Raina just places it through point and gets a boundary! IND 39/1 in 5 overs 19.24 IST: IN THE AIR... SAFE! Miscommunication in the field now. A length ball on middle and leg, Raina looks to go over the on side now but mistimes this one too. It goes off the toe end of the bat towards the region between mid on and mid-wicket. Chris Jordan is at mid on, Moeen Ali is at mid-wicket but both leave it to each other. In the end, the ball lands in between, albeit not sure whether either of them could have got to it anyways. A single taken. 19.22 IST: Here's Jordan's impressive effort to run out Kohli.  ð??¸ What. A. Hit! Take a bow, @CJordan ð??? #INDvENGpic.twitter.com/mdkvD8rF3b19.20 IST: FOUR! Up and over! Back-to-back boundaries for Rahul!

Effortlessly done! Full and on middle and off, Rahul flicks it without any fuss over square leg. There is a man in place in the deep but he is at mid-wicket and the ball meets the fence! Even Plunkett is amazed at that shot. 19.17 IST: SIX! Lovely shot! Finally Raina gets one away. Landed outside off, slightly short of a full length, Raina backs away slightly, then reaches out and lofts it cleanly over cover-point for a maximum! IND 17/1 in 3 overs  19.13 IST: Suresh Raina realising that India need to capitalise on the fielding restrictions. Both Raina and Rahul are trying to up the ante and take the attack to the opposition. IND 8/1 after 2 overs 19:06 IST: OUT! Virat Kohli run-out. The India captain scored for an impossible single, Rahul sent him back and Jordan, the bowler picked the ball up and an easy direct hit sent Kohli on his way back. India 4/1 from 1.1 overs. Suresh Raina walks in next19.00 IST: KL Rahul and Virat Kohli walks in to open the innings. The balls comes onto the bat quite well in Bengaluru and they will look to set a total of 170-180. England bat deep and with the dew coming in later on, India will have their work cut out to post a good total on the board.18.49 IST: England was lucky for the third time in a row. Winning three out of three toss'England have won the toss and will bowl first.

The wicket looks reasonably good. It's a high-scoring ground. Hopefully we put up a complete performance tonight. The bowlers have come a long way, hopefully the batsmen come to the fore tonight. It's a huge game. It's a big final. It's a great stage to come out and express yourself. Liam Dawson misses out, Liam Plunkett comes back.18.41 IST: Virat Kohli: Seeing the wicket how dry it is, maybe it will be perfect to bat on in the first half. Just felt a bit of dew while practicing now. We have to bat better than the last two games. The surface is pretty dry. I think it is going to break a bit. I think it is going to help the spinners a bit in the second innings. We got to put up a big total because this is a high-scoring ground. We have worked hard throughout the season. 18.34 IST: Just one change for India. Rishabh Pant comes in place of Manish Pandey18:31 IST: TOSS!

Thank you - #TeamIndia@msdhonipic.twitter.com/swnMcKzFld18.09 IST: England will be raring to make amends after throwing it away in the second T20I. However, it will be a humongous task for the visitors to get the better of an opponent brimming with confidence. They may have displayed fighting abilities and also won the opening game, but the hosts will still have their nose ahead at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium.
