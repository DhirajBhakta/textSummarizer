MP whose behaviour resulted in 'no-fly' rule hails the move.
Shiv Sena MP Ravindra Gaikwad, who was temporarily banned from domestic flight travel after he assaulted a 60-year old Air India staffer, has now called for guidelines to control the behaviour of airline staff.Earlier on Friday, the civil aviation ministry announced a new set of guidelines for dealing with unruly passengers on flights. The government announced draft rules for a national 'no-fly list' which proposes a ban on domestic air travel  that can last for a period ranging from three months, to two years or beyond.Gaikwad called it a "welcome move," but he had more to say."But these are just draft guidelines. I think there should be stricter guidelines for the airline staff as well" Gaikwad told India Today in Mumbai."Sometimes even passengers have to suffer due to the behaviour of airline staff, that also should have some strict guidelines...Forget us, we usually fly on domestic routes, but you can ask passengers who travel long distance," he added.THREE LEVELS OF OFFENCESThe proposed draft has three levels of offences that can lead to a person being listed on the No Fly List.The first level includes disruptive behaviour such as physical gestures, punishable by suspension for three months. The second level is for physical abuse - pushing, kicking, sexual harassment and the like - punishable by a 6-month suspension.Level 3 offences include murderous assault, life-threatening behaviour, or causing damage to aircraft operating systems. The penalty for such offences would be suspension for two years or more.The new guidelines also have a penalty structure through which an unruly passenger can be fined up to Rs 5 lakh for delaying a flight by an hour, Rs 10 lakh for delays longer than an hour, and Rs 15 lakh for delays longer than two hours.
