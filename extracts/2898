Remark on daughter Jhanvi's marriage misunderstood: Sridevi.
When Sridevi said in an interview that she would be happier to see her elder daughter Jhanvi get married than act, she faced backlash as some people took it to mean that the actor was against her daughter having a career. Sridevi took to Twitter to clarify her comment and said that she was "misunderstood."She wrote, "My comment was misunderstood and it really concerns me that it's sounding like I believe girls are only meant to get married and settle down. That's not what I want for my daughters, I want them to be able to stand on the own feet and have their own identity. I've always told them never to be dependent on anyone in any capacity."Sridevi added, "It's very important to me that young girls understand that the end goal of their life is not to get married and have babies and they have every right to make something of themselves if they wish to. What I meant to say initially was that I would prefer if my daughters didn't lead the kind of hectic life that comes with this business and instead have a relatively stable and relaxed life. But they are ambitious and I have come to respect that like every parent should, and that respect overshadows my protective parental instincts now."pic.twitter.com/aylNciNqBPOn the work front, Sridevi is gearing up for the release of her film, Mom, which will hit theatres on July 7. Directed by Ravi Udyawar, the film also stars Nawazuddin Siddiqui, Akshaye Khanna, Adnan Siddiqui and Sajal Ali in pivotal roles. Jhanvi, meanwhile, is set to make her entry in Bollywood. However, her debut film has not been announced yet.
