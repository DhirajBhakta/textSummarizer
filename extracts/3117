Felt I was forced to dance but started enjoying it: Siddiqui.
Mumbai, Jun 5 (PTI) Tiger Shroff said if Nawazuddin Siddiqui, who is a powerhouse performer, starts dancing as well then other actors jobs will be in trouble. Tiger has teamed up with Nawazuddin for the upcoming dance-action, "Munna Michael". The story is about a young man from the streets, called Munna, played by Tiger, who is a big fan of Michael Jackson. Munna teaches dancing to Mahinder Fauji, played by Nawazuddin, who is a gangster with dancing ambitions. When asked how it was to dance on screen, Nawazuddin told reporters, "Initially I felt I was forced to do it, but I started enjoying dancing while doing the film... Dance is a passion just like acting. Its God gift to people. But I am not one of the gifted ones." The actor was speaking at the trailer launch of the film. Tiger, who was also present at the event, quickly added, "If he starts dancing too, humara kaam mushkil ho jayega (our jobs would be difficult). I dont think we will be able to perform as good as Nawaz sir. He is just a holistic actor. After watching the film his fans will be surprised." Nawazuddin, 43, said he has tried to match up the dancing skills of Tiger. "I cant be a dancing hero, but if I get a solo hero film Ill definitely do it but it shouldnt have dancing. I danced with a lot of difficulty and learnt a lot by observing Tigers dancing steps. I cant dance like him, but have tried to match him. I think I have tried to reach nearly 5 per cent of his dancing skills." For the 27-year-old "Heropanti" actor, acting with Nawazuddin was intimidating but also helpful.
