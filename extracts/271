I'm overprotective, want to wrap my sister in blanket: Tiger.
Usually soft-spoken, actor Tiger Shroff says that he is ?over-protective? beyond imagination when it comes to his sister Krishna Shroff. ?If you ask me, obviously I?m the kind of guy who just wants to wrap his sister in a blanket, because I am an over-protective brother,? says Tiger. ?I know that after saying this, people will react and say, ?Oh, he?s a sexist,? and I?ll be called all sorts of names. But I don?t care, because people like to perceive things in their own way.? Tiger recently faced flak for calling his female co-stars ?padding?, but he later clarified that the word was used for anything outside his own zone in a film project, and that he wasn?t referring to the female leads specifically.Given how protective he is, we ask why Tiger didn?t fire at those who trolled Krishna for posting her ?topless? photos on Instagram ? the photos, in fact, only showed her bare back ? even though his father, actor Jackie Shroff, was vocal about the matter.    #Repost @divina_rikhye_photography with @repostapp. ???

A lot of people out there get [all sorts of] photo shoots done and post their pictures, so it?s her wish, whether she wanted to or not. Everybody has that freedom of [expression] and? you can?t always expect positive [reactions] from others.?The actor, whose films include Heropanti (2014), Baaghi, A Flying Jatt (2016) and the recent release Munna Michael, calls his sister his ?biggest and most honest critic?.    #Repost @divina_rikhye_photography with @repostapp. ???

She has studied filmmaking, so she?s very intellectual in that sense. The best piece of advice she gave me was, ?Don?t overdo it, and just be in the character. Don?t do too much, don?t do too little.? Thankfully, after Munna Michael, she didn?t have much to say, because she was there on the sets all the time.? That?s because Krishna was assisting on the film.?She was like my second director,? says Tiger. ?Every time I was unsure about a particular scene, she?d always be there to support and guide me, because she could see how it looked on the monitor screen. She?d tell me things like how Nawazji [Nawazuddin Siddiqui] was reacting, what was happening in the background, what I shouldn?t do in empty spaces, and how I could improvise.?Follow @htshowbiz for more
