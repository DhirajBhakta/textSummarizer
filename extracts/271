I'm overprotective, want to wrap my sister in blanket: Tiger.
Usually soft-spoken, actor Tiger Shroff says that he is over-protective beyond imagination when it comes to his sister Krishna Shroff. If you ask me, obviously Im the kind of guy who just wants to wrap his sister in a blanket, because I am an over-protective brother, says Tiger. I know that after saying this, people will react and say, Oh, hes a sexist, and Ill be called all sorts of names. But I dont care, because people like to perceive things in their own way. Tiger recently faced flak for calling his female co-stars padding, but he later clarified that the word was used for anything outside his own zone in a film project, and that he wasnt referring to the female leads specifically.Given how protective he is, we ask why Tiger didnt fire at those who trolled Krishna for posting her topless photos on Instagram  the photos, in fact, only showed her bare back  even though his father, actor Jackie Shroff, was vocal about the matter.    #Repost @divina_rikhye_photography with @repostapp.  With @kishushroff  #natural #photography #portraitseries A post shared by Krishna Shroff (@kishushroff) on Aug 20, 2015 at 6:22am PDT Tiger says, I didnt take a stand because I dont see anything wrong with what my sister posted it wasnt in your face. A lot of people out there get [all sorts of] photo shoots done and post their pictures, so its her wish, whether she wanted to or not. Everybody has that freedom of [expression] and you cant always expect positive [reactions] from others.The actor, whose films include Heropanti (2014), Baaghi, A Flying Jatt (2016) and the recent release Munna Michael, calls his sister his biggest and most honest critic.    #Repost @divina_rikhye_photography with @repostapp.  With @kishushroff  #natural #photography #portraitseries A post shared by Krishna Shroff (@kishushroff) on Aug 20, 2015 at 6:22am PDT Stating that his father rarely gives him feedback on his performance, Tiger adds, The maximum inputs come from Krishna. She has studied filmmaking, so shes very intellectual in that sense. The best piece of advice she gave me was, Dont overdo it, and just be in the character. Dont do too much, dont do too little. Thankfully, after Munna Michael, she didnt have much to say, because she was there on the sets all the time. Thats because Krishna was assisting on the film.She was like my second director, says Tiger. Every time I was unsure about a particular scene, shed always be there to support and guide me, because she could see how it looked on the monitor screen. Shed tell me things like how Nawazji [Nawazuddin Siddiqui] was reacting, what was happening in the background, what I shouldnt do in empty spaces, and how I could improvise.Follow @htshowbiz for more
