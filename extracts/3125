The animal was provided with a packet-full of fodder to eat and relax. However, the food packet somehow blocked the eyesight of the animal which made it all the more furious. Irked by this and the unbearable heat, the horse broke away from the pole it was tied to. There was panic on the street as people started running to safety from the crazy horse. As the animal reached Jacob Road in Civil Lines, it first dashed into a motorcyclist and then jumped into a car head on breaking the front windshield. Both the animal and the driver of the car, Pankaj Joshi who works for an event management company, suffered injuries, in the freak accident. Locals launched a rescue effort immediately and were later joined by a team from the forest department. While Joshi was discharged after first aid, the horse was still recuperating."The horse reacted in such a manner due to the intense heat. The fact that it was unable to see when tied to the pole also irked the animal. It suffered some injuries but there is nothing serious," Dr. Arvind Mathur, the doctor treating the horse told India Today. ALSO READ:
