Don't deny flats to meat eaters, warns Raj Thackeray's MNS.
Now, Raj Thackeray-led Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) has written letters to building constructors and asked them to stop discrimination while selling flats in their buildings. In the letter, MNS requests various realty developers of Mumbai not to discriminate between people on the basis of caste, creed and religion.One such letter was written to Shri Chamunda Realtors by MNS spokesperson Sandeep Deshpande. Deshpande, who was former corporator and group leader in BMC for MNS, writes that he has received complaints about Chamunda Realtors that they discriminate between customers while selling flat. In the letter, Deshpande alleges that the said company doesn't sell flats to people who eat non-vegetarian food."We had raise this issue in BMC and had asked mayor to make a strict law so that there will not be any discrimination about not selling flats to non-vegetarian people. This proposal was unanimously passed by BMC house, but ex-mayor didn't make any law. Now, we have intensified our agitation, and in extreme case, we may take law in our hands if situation remains the same," said Sandeep Deshpande, MNS spokesperson.MNS workers have been asked to gather information about such builders who don't sell flats to non-vegetarian people. They will be writing letter to all such builders throughout this week. In the past, MNS had intensified its agitation against BMC's decision of shutting meat shops during Jain community festival Paryushan, and their workers had sold meat openly during that week. Raj Thackeray-led MNS has seen debacle over debacle since last Lok Sabha election. The party didn't even perform well in last BMC election. Now, it seems to revive the party after Marathi Manus agenda, now Raj Thackeray has taken up the issue of veg-non-veg.Also read:Mumbai: MNS corporator denied flat for being non-vegetarian, files complaint
