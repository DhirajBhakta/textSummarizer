Neither kisan nor jawan happy since BJP got power: Kejriwal.
Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal today said neither 'the kisan' (farmers) nor jawans have been happy since Prime Minister Narendra Modi's BJP government was formed in 2014. Kejriwal is also the national convenor of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP).Farmers have been "betrayed" by the Modi government, and Indians have to stand and fight with them, Kejriwal said. His remarks come at a time when several states have witnessed protests by farmers."It's sad that farmers have taken to the roads and...have been attacked. Where is the development in our land, if farmers are boycotting their own produce and throwing them on roads" he asked.Voters chose the BJP out of hope - thinking the Congress was the party of the elite - but they now realise both parties are the same, the Delhi CM said. He pointed out that neither the Congress nor the BJP had implemented the Swaminathan Commission's report. "Every citizen should take a vow to make sure the Swaminathan Commission (report) is implemented," he added.While commenting on the plight of the nation's farmers, Kejriwal also referred to absconding liquor baron Vijay Mallya, who was recently granted bail till December 4 by a UK court."Farmers are forced to commit suicide over...(debt)...and those who owe the country 9,000 crores, the government flies them out to London in the middle of the night," he said.ALSO READ | Agra farmers threaten indefinite fast at UP CM residence if potato MSP not raised
