India don't play Pakistan team as they are scared: PCB head.
Pakistan Cricket Board chief Shaharyar Khan has said India are scared of playing Pakistan after losing the Champions Trophy final at The Oval on June 18. India and Pakistan have not played bilateral cricket since 2012 when the latter travelled across the border for a short limited-overs tour. That was the only series between the arch-rivals since the 2008 terror attacks in Mumbai.However, the two countries have continued to play at ICC events with India enjoying a clear upper-hand. Pakistan, though, stunned India with some spirited cricket in the final of the Champions Trophy. Pakpassion.com reported that Shaharyar, the outgoing PCB chief, felt India continue to refuse to play bilateral cricket with Pakistan because "they are scared of our team.""After our win, we challenge India to come and play bilateral cricket with us. They don't play us, they are scared of our team. They say we'll play you in ICC matches but they won't play us otherwise," Shaharyar said at the Pakistani Prime Minister's reception of the Pakistan team.
