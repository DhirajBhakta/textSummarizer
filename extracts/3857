I wanted to make a film featuring Akshay Kumar: Shah Rukh.
It's the season of clashes, and the next time we will see two superstars locking horns at the box office is August 11, when Shah Rukh Khan's Imtiaz Ali film opposite Anushka Sharma will hit screens at the same time as Akshay Kumar and Bhumi Pednekar's Toilet: Ek Prem Katha. Even though the media has been having a field day reporting about SRK and Akshay's rivalry, King Khan would have you believe otherwise.Talking about the film that Salman Khan and Karan Johar are producing with Akshay Kumar in the lead, Shah Rukh told DNA that he wanted to produce a film with the actor too. "it should have been done a long time back. But it's very good that Karan and Salman are making a film with Akshay. I wanted to do that. But the story and all didn't work out. I'm sure he is really open to it," he said.Rajeev Masand's column in Open Magazine says that the two actors have never been friendly, but SRK has an extremely practical point of view. Rivalry or not, it's business first. "Firstly, we should get this correct. They should not be taken as individuals, as Karan or Salman. It's Dharma and SKF. They are different identities, they are film producers. It's about the company, not about individuals. So, two companies have come together to make a film with a big movie star. Similarly, we at Red Chillies do it too," he told DNA.
