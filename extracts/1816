Mumbai Congress members get tattoos calling PM Modi corrupt.
Mumbai Congress has come up with a unique way to protest against government's decision of demonetisation. About 50 Congress workers in Mumbai got a tattoo on their hand which reads "huamara pradhan mantri rishwatkhor hain." According to these Congressmen, even after 50 days of demonetisation there is no respite for the people and that the situation has only worsened."We wanted to question PM Modi on Saturday when he was on a visit to Mumbai about the allegations levelled against him by Rahul Gandhi, but police kept us under house arrest. Rahul asked him about the money that he received from big business houses but PM doesn't want to answer and thus we have decided on these temporary tattoos. It is our way to protest against PM who is still silent on such serious charges," said Sanjay Nirupam, Mumbai Congress Chief.Also Read: Congress hits out at BJP for not investigating Amit Shah's bank accounts From December 30 midnight, Mumbai Congress will start a missed call line where people who feel they are hit by the decision of demonetisation can give a missed call and register their protest.  The Mumbai Congress has also planned to do a mass rally against demonetisation on January 6 and gherao the collector office's in western suburban area of the city.
