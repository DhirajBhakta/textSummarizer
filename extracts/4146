RSS slams TMC-led WB govt over decline in Hindu population.
Coimbatore, Mar 21 (PTI) The RSS today expressed concern over the growing Jehadi activities and the declining Hindu population in West Bengal and and urged the people to create awareness against the state governments communal politics. It also accused the Mamata Banerjee government of giving encouragement to the anti-national elements due to its Muslim vote bank politics. A resolution adopted at the three-day meeting of the Akhil Bharatiya Pratinidhi Sabha (ABPS), the RSS top policy making body, also condemned the extremist violence. "This (decline in Hindu population in West Bengal) is a matter of serious concern to the unity and integrity of the country," RSS Joint General Secretary Dattatreya Hosabale told reporters briefing about the deliberations at the meeting. The resolution said the ABPS strongly "condemns the violence by extremists and the Muslim appeasement policy of the state government and calls upon the countrymen to create awareness against the Jehadi violence and the communal politics of the state government." Hosabale said after partition, the Hindus from East Pakistan were forced to seek refuge in West Bengal. It was not surprising that due to such large influx, the Hindu population in the state, which constituted 78.45 per cent in 1951 had declined to 70.54 per cent as per the 2011 census, he said. The meeting also calls upon the state government to rise above "petty vote-bank politics" and discharge its constitutional obligations, he said. Hosable urged the Centre to ensure firm action against the anti-national jehadi elements within the state in the interest of national security.
