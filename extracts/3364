Happy Rajini's 2.0 isn't releasing with Golmaal Again: Rohit.
Mumbai, May 11 (PTI) Director Rohit Shetty says he is happy that his upcoming film "Golmaal 4" will not have to face competition from Ranjinikanths "2.0" at the box office as now both the movies are releasing on separate dates. Earlier Rohits film starring Ajay Devgn, Tabu, Parineeti Chopra and Arshad Warsi, was set to release this Diwali alongside "2.0". "We tried to do that (referring to pushing ahead the release date) but we were not getting the right date. If we come on solo week or normal week then it is ok. But when you clash (at the box office) obviously the window is not that big as far as business is concerned," Rohit told PTI.
