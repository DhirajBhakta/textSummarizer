Regret talking about Sridevi's Baahubali casting: Rajamouli.
India's most anticipated film, Baahubali 2: The Conclusion, had an overwhelming response from fans across the world when it release on April 28. Though Ramya Krishnan's performance deserves a special mention, the character Sivagami will be more remembered for the controversy associated with Sridevi and filmmaker SS Rajamouli. It's a well-known fact that Sridevi was initially approached for playing Sivagami's role. However, when the Himmatwala actor turned down the offer, reports were doing the rounds that the actor demanded a higher remuneration for the film and hence, the makers offered the role to Ramya. Recently, Sridevi, while promoting her film Mom, said she was hurt by SS Rajamouli's comments and that the reports about her remuneration were baseless. Now, Rajamouli has responded to Sridevi's statements and has said that he made a mistake.According to a report in DNA, Rajamouli was quoted as saying, "As for whose version to believe, I guess it is for people to decide. But one thing is for sure, I shouldn't have discussed the details on a public platform. That's a mistake. And I regret it.""I have huge respect for Srideviji as a flag-bearer of the southern film industries in Mumbai for many years. I wish her all the best. And I wish Mom a big success as the trailer looks very intriguing and promising," he added.Rajamouli, in an interview to a regional channel, went on the record saying that the team was 'lucky' that Sridevi rejected the offer to play Sivagami.ALSO READ: Mom Movie Review
