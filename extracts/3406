80% of officers in BSF are corrupt: Sacked jawan.
Tej Bahadur Yadav, the BSF jawan who was dismissed from duty for uploading a video on the 'substandard food' served to soldiers, today attended a Mumbai event honouring martyrs. Mumbai Congress Chief Sanjay Nirupam had called on Yadav to preside over the function as a guest. Speaking about his dismissal Tej Bahadur said, "Under rule 117, we get three months time to appeal to DG against dismissal. The process is on and my lawyers are working on it."'80 PER CENT OFFICERS CORRUPT'He added that if he loses the appeal against his dismissal, then he will knock the court's doors. Apart from condemning the poor quality of food being served, Bahadur had also alleged how officers were siphoning off money sent for the soldiers' upkeep at border areas.He further said, "Government sent us 18 different food items but several times, the authorities gave us only Khichdi... The system is corrupt but not all officers are corrupt. But yes, around 80 per cent officers in forces are corrupt."Tej Bahadur Yadav along with several other ex-servicemen will stage a one-day protest at Jantar Mantar on May 14. The sit-in protest will serve as an ultimatum to government to act on the deeply seated corruption in the armed forces.
