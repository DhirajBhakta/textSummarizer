Sanjay apologises for bodyguards assaulting media persons.
Sanjay Dutt, who is in Agra shooting for his comeback film Bhoomi, has run into trouble with the law again. The actor's bodyguards roughed up some local mediapersons on Thursday, who filed a police complaint. Reportedly, Sanjay was present when the attack took place, but left the spot. However, he has since issued an apology to the mediapersons.Earlier this week, the shooting of Sanjay's film was stalled when crowds which had gathered to get a glimpse of the actor went out of control.
