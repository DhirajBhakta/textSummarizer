Kohli's captaincy is iron-fisted dictatorship: Shane Watson.
Former Australia all-rounder Shane Watson admires the way India captain Virat Kohli rallies behind his troops on the field and how he expects the best from everybody in the team just like he does from himself.

(Kohli's message on Holi: Please don't harm animals on streets)"Virat Kohli's captaincy is an iron-fisted dictatorship and Australia must brace themselves for the attack of the clones in Ranchi," Watson told The Daily Telegraph.Watson played a season of the Indian Premier League under the Royal Challengers Bangalore skipper last year and therefore, knows a thing or two about Kohli."I wouldn't say he's got a temper, he just rides the highs and lows of the game from an emotional point of view. He wants to win, he hates losing and as a captain that's how he's built."One of the things I absolutely love about Virat is he's got such a deep down burning desire to win and obviously he's up to pushing the limits."The Border-Gavaskar series between India and Australia is at a stage where both teams have registered one win each with the penultimate match to be played in Ranchi from Thursday. The war of words had started even before series had commenced and problems escalated between the two sides in the last match in Bengaluru where Steve Smith got involved in the DRS controversy, prompting some strong words from his counterpart Virat Kohli, while the BCCI lodged an official complaint against the Australia captain and Peter Handscomb.
