All options against Pakistan open: Army chief Bipin Rawat.
As tension with Pakistan remains at an all-time high over frequent ceasefire violations and funding of terror in Jammu and Kashmir from across the border, Indian Army chief General Bipin Rawat today said all options are open against the belligerent neighbour. In details of a high-level meeting in Srinagar to discuss border security, accessed by India Today, General Rawat is reported to have discussed "all options" against Pakistan's aggression along the Line of Control (LoC) and the international border. General Rawat had visited Jammu and Kashmir last week to review the security and also met state Governor NN Vohra to discuss the security situation. His statement comes as tension continues to simmer along the India-Pakistan border, with several ceasefire violations being reported in recent months. Last week, a civilian was killed and two others, including a BSF trooper, were injured in firing exchanges between Pakistani and Indian troops along the LoC.On the same day, Pakistan also summoned the Indian Deputy High Commissioner in Islamabad over fresh ceasefire violations on the Line of Control, claiming that one Pakistani civilian was killed. The Army on May 23 had released a video of attack on Pakistani posts across the LoC. The video showed what appeared as bunkers in a forested area being bombed and smoke and fire billowing up after the explosion.The mutilation of Indian soldiers by Pakistani border forces, the Kulbhushan Jadhav trial, and the funding of Kashmiri separatists to fuel unrest in the Valley as exposed by India Today have been the other sticking points between the two countries.Also read:The gloves are off: Hardliner Gen Bipin Rawat fights Kashmir insurgency, with government's backing
