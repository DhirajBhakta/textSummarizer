India wants 4G and 5G, not equal rights for women: Richa.
Richa Chadha prefers to be tight-lipped about anything related to her love life, and she holds the society responsible for her stance. Asked about her relationship status, she said, The way it goes, even if I was (seeing someone)  I wouldnt be able to tell you.The Masaan actor feels that people in India are too judgmental about everything, especially with regard to women.  This prevents her from disclosing more details on her personal life.    Despite delays, some sunshine. @vickykaushal09 #traveldiaries #amcominghome #twoyearsofMasaan A post shared by Richa Chadha (@therichachadha) on Jul 24, 2017 at 1:30pm PDT I am sure that if I were somewhere else [other than India], I would probably be a lot more open. So, for the practical purpose of leading my life peacefully, I dont say anything about my personal life because it is a waste of time, says Richa.The actor  says that this  prevalent inequality in todays society, makes her uncomfortable. As a nation, we want 4G and 5G, but we dont want women to have the same rights as men and we dont want all communities and castes to have same rights as others, says Richa.The actor, who is currently seen in a web series, has garnered applause for her work at international film festivals. However, back home, she agrees that small films never get enough attention. We have a lot of systematic problems which kill small films. Like films dont get the number of shows they should. They already have very limited number of slots. So, if you are playing Masaan once at  9pm in the night and another show at 11am, they will not pull the crowds in normal days because people are working. In small cities, the problem is that there are no screens at all, because single screen were shut down, she says.Follow @htshowbiz for more
