China cancels media trip for Indian journos amid stand-off.
China has called off the annual media trip that it organises for journalists to travel to Tibet. Following the recent border stand-off between Chinese and Indian troops, the tour of five Indian and as many Nepalese journalists has been cancelled.No official reason was given by the embassy officials to the journalists. One of the participants, Vijay Naik, Convenor of Indian Association of Foreign Affairs Correspondents said, "The invite was received but because the tensions have increased the Chinese may have thought of letting things cool down and let the atmosphere become conducive again for the media programme to resume. But, we have no official communication explaining the reason for the cancellation."The trip was to commence from July 8 and end on July 15. It was only on Saturday that the participants were informed of the cancellation when they were all set for the journey. Speaking to India Today Agni Roy, Senior Editor with Ananda Bazaar Patrika said, "We all were waiting to go to Tibet. My passport is still deposited in the Chinese embassy as I was supposed to get my visa on Monday. It is really disappointing".The Chinese embassy organises these annual trips to Tibet with journalists from the region. This last minute cancellation many believe is the direct result of the border tensions at the tri-junction where India (in Sikkim), China and Bhutan meet.
