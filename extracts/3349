AAP MLA detained for launching protest outside Mishra's home.
Aam Aadmi Party MLA Sanjeev Jha, who was planning to go on a hunger strike against the allegations made by sacked party leader Kapil Mishra, was today detained by Delhi Police. According to the police, Jha did not have permission to hold the strike and was thus detained along with his supporters. Jha said that he would join Kapil Mishra, if the allegations made by him against Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal are proven to be correct. Sacked Delhi minister Kapil Mishra is on an indefinite hunger strike ever since he challenged Aam Aadmi Party leaders to declare the source of funding for their foreign trips.This is the fourth day that Mishra has been on hunger strike and he said he will continue it despite doctors saying that he needs to be hospitalised.Also Read
