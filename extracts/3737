Modi conspired against Advani: Lalu on Babri Masjid case.
The Supreme Court's revival of the conspiracy charge against BJP veteran LK Advani in the Babri Masjid demolition case is itself a conspiracy of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to remove the BJP veteran from the Presidential race, Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) chief Lalu Prasad said today. "The CBI is in the hands of the Prime Minister, and the CBI today said in court that the case of conspiracy should take place against Advani in the Babri case. Advani was tipped to become President this time. The PM has clipped Advani's chances of becoming the President. Anyone can understand that it is a political conspiracy of the Modi government to eliminate Advani from the race," Lalu said in Patna. The Presidential elections are due by July this year. Though the BJP has not announced any candidate yet, there are rumours of Advani, 89, as one of the front-runners. The RJD chief further said the conspiracy against Advani has been hatched despite him supporting Narendra Modi in the aftermath of the 2002 Gujarat riots. "Advani supported Modi during the Gujarat riots. (The then Prime Minister Atal Bihari) Vajpayee asked Modi to follow the Raj Dharma, but Advani saved Modi," the Bihar leader said. Earlier today, the Supreme Court ruled Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi, Rajasthan Governor Kalyan Singh, Union Minister Uma Bharti, and others in the BJP and the Vishwa Hindu Parishad must face the conspiracy charge in the 1992 demolition case.
