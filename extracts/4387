NDA calls for dharna against Bihar minister's insult to PM.
The National Democratic Alliance (NDA) has called for a state-wide dharna and protest to demand the ouster of Bihar minister Abdul Jalil Mastan, who called Prime Minister Narendra Modi a "Naxal" and a "Dacoit" at a Congress-organized Jan Vedna rally in Purnea on February 22. Mastan has since apologised for his comments.By calling for the dharna, the NDA has effectively stepped up pressure on Chief Minister Nitish Kumar to sack his ministerial colleague.NDA leaders have fanned out across the state, and will stage dharnas at all district headquarters.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has alleged that although Chief Minister Nitish maintains that he neither frames nor protects anyone, he's shielding Mastan and not expelling him from his cabinet. "The Minister has said that he was not present at the rally on the day, so what is the purpose of him apologising for his tirade against the PM," asked senior BJP leader Sushil Modi.The BJP alleged that the nation's sentiments were hurt by the insult to the PM, and have threatened to carry on with their agitation in the street, as well as inside the Assembly. For the last three days, the NDA hasn't  allowed the Assembly to function as a result of the Mastan issue. ALSO READ:
