Respect for Twinkle increased: Akshay on babysitting Nitara.
Taking care of a daughter and working on a film is not a cake walk. Ask actor Akshay Kumar and he will tell you how difficult it is. The 49-year-old actor, who is currently shooting for Reema Kagti's Gold in London, is also babysitting his daughter as wife Twinkle Khanna is touring Europe. And in an interview to Mumbai Mirror, the Rustom actor confessed that his respect for his wife has gone several notches higher. He told the daily, "My wife (Twinkle Khanna) is touring Europe, my son Aarav is in Oxford for a two-week study course so I'm babysitting my daughter Nitara besides shooting for a film (Reema Kagti's sports-drama Gold). And I have to confess that minding a little girl is a tough job."He added, "My admiration for Mrs Funnybones has gone up several notches after realising the magnitude of the task. I don't know how she writes, designs, looks after our children and still manages to stay calm on most days."Akshay, who is juggling between work and taking care of his daughter, revealed, "Every morning, Nitara and I have breakfast together, then, we go to this park nearby where one can feed rabbits and goats. After her day-nurse comes, I travel to London for my shoot. Post 'pack-up', I take my daughter out again. The other evening, we went to watch Cars. Half way through the film she decided that she was tired, so we had to leave and drive back. I tried explaining to her that I wanted to continue watching the movie till the end, to no avail. Bringing up a baby is tough."On the work front, Akshay is awaiting the release of Toilet Ek Prem Katha opposite Bhumi Pednekar.
