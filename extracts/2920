Akshay is bigger star than Khans in Bollywood, says Salman.
He is one of Bollywood's biggest stars. If his films set the box office on fire, his personal life often finds place in the juicy columns of tabloids. But Bollywood's Bajrangi Bhaijaan thinks that there is another actor who is a bigger star than all the Khans. In an interview to DNA, when Salman was asked about superstardom, he said, "Today, when they say (superstars) I think there is Aamir, Shah Rukh, me, and Akshay Kumar. We do fewer films - I do two films a year, Aamir does one film in three years, Akshay does four-five films a year. So you do the math."Salman is a huge admirer of Khiladi Kumar and said that he works more than any of the Khans in Bollywood, and therefore, he truly deserves the tag of a superstar. "The man who works that hard and makes the maximum amount of money, and supports those many production companies, those many units, and those many directors every four months is a bigger star," added the 51-year-old actor. Akshay is known to do 3-4 films a year, while Salman mostly sticks to 1-2 films. Talking about doing less films than Akshay, the Wanted actor said, "I think Akki is the only one who understood that back in the day, char-paanch lakh ke liye itni jyaada mehnat kar rahe the, ab crores ke liye utni mehnat nahi kar rahe hain. When we were paid so little per film, we did more films. Now we get paid so much more for a film, and we are doing fewer films." On the work front, Akshay will be next seen in Toilet Ek Prem Katha, while Salman is awaiting the release of Tubelight.
