RSS didn't hoist national flag for 52 years: Rahul Gandhi.
Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi today attacked the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), saying the BJP's ideological mentor had not hoisted the national flag at their headquarters for 52 years after India's independence in 1947."For 52 years after the independence, the RSS did not have a tricolour at their headquarters in Nagpur. They used to salute the saffron flag, not the national flag," Rahul said at an election rally in Uttarakhand's Rishikesh.In 2002, the right-wing organisation had hoisted the national flag at Smruti Bhawan, which houses the memorials of the first two RSS chiefs, founder Dr Keshav Baliram Hedgewar and Guru Golwalkar.The last time the national flag was hoisted there was on August 15, 1947 and on January 26, 1950 and stopped since then, RSS sources said.ON DEMONETISATIONAttacking Prime Minister Narendra Modi over demonetisation, Rahul said the government has "murdered" the soul of an autonomous institution like the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)."The Congress party made and strengthened the RBI so that there is a body which is not under government pressure since it takes economic decisions. But in a minute, the soul of this institution was murdered by Modi ji," Rahul said.ON REPLACING GANDHI IN KHADI CALENDAROn the controversial Khadi Gram Udyog calendars and diaries which for the first time carried Modi's pictures, and not Mahatma Gandhi's, the 46-year-old leader said, "Modi replaced the picture of the man who took three bullets for the nation.""A charkha is about the blood and toil of the khadi workers. On the one hand Modi ji takes photos with the charkha, on the other he works for 50 corporates the whole day," he said.
