16 private Noida schools get notice over empty RTE quota.
The education department of the district administration has issued a notice to 16 schools for failing to initiate the admission process for underprivileged children, under the Right To Education (RTE) Act.The list comprises renowned schools such as Cambridge School, Kothari International School, Modern Public School, Millennium School, Apeejay Public School, Shiv Nadar School and Delhi Public School.Under Section 12 (1) G of the Right to Education Act, 2009, all private schools must offer 25% of their seats to underprivileged children free of cost.Recently, in a meet held among officials of the CBSE, schools and district administration, the district magistrate BN Singh had asked schools to fill their quota of 25% under RTE. Singh had also provided a list of 1,493 children to the schools who were awaiting admission. The list was ascertained after an offline and online draw was organised by the administration.However, according to the district basic education officer, MP Verma, many schools have not started the process of admitting underprivileged children under RTE.We have received complaints that many schools were demanding money for admission under RTE and that many were also denying admission. We have decided to take strict action against these schools and have given them a final warning asking them to enrol the kids as soon as possible, said Verma.The schools have been given a two-day window to initiate the admission process. If the schools are still adamant on not admitting the kids, then we will take action. A fine of Rs1 lakh will be levied on them and we will write a letter recommending the cancellation of their licence, said Verma.
