India's only existing steam engine put on display in Haryana.
A shiny, sleek white steam engine huffing and puffing away, much like us in this stifling heat, is an unusual sight in the middle of nowhere, just beyond Bilaspur in Haryana. Located at the Heritage Transport Museum, India's only transport museum, the steam engine was unveiled at the museum on Saturday.Home to about 2,500 curated vintage cars, buses, trains and pre-mechanised modes of transportation like bullock carts and even boats and an aviation gallery, the museum is the brainchild of Tarun Thakral, founder and managing trustee, and traces the evolution of modes of transport in India."There aren't any steam engines operational because it's quite expensive. Even the toy trains work on diesel or battery. So, the younger genera-tion has no idea what a steam engine looks like or functions. This is an opportunity for them to see the same," says Tarun. The 12.5-ft tall and 31-ft long engine moved back and forth on the relatively small track, using wood to obtain the steam. The engine, originally built in 1953 by a German locomotive manufacturer, has been restored from its dilapidated condition in which it was found in Bihar. "It took three months to restore it, while permissions and talks with the Indian Railways to acquire it took about three years. We are using wood here because coal quality is not good," says Tarun. This steam engine will be operational on special occasio-ns and one can also pay and get the engine moving, in case anyone wants a private experience.The museum, which opened in December 2013, after Tarun fell in love with cars. "I needed space to store them and I had this land. So, I applied for permissions and decided to open a transport museum," concludes Tarun.
