Govt to set up special units to probe crimes against women.
Taking in view the rise in attacks against women across the country, the Modi government has decided to augment capacity of states in investigation of crimes like rape, acid attack, dowry death and human trafficking by setting up 200 special investigating units after identifying the "most crime-prone districts".There were 34,651 cases of rape and 384 cases of acid attacks reported across India last year. The country also witnessed 25,800 dowry deaths between 2013 and 2015. An affidavit filed by the Home Ministry in the Supreme Court said Investigative Units for Crime Against Women (IUCAW) will be set up on a 50:50 cost sharing basis with the states, subject to ceiling of Rs 28 lakh per unit.
