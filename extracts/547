Cricket should have mixed team like tennis, suggests Akshay.
Bollywood actor Akshay Kumar attended the Womens Cricket World Cup final at Lords cricket ground, London, on July 23. Although our women in blue couldn't lift the cup, they won everyones heart back home in India. This has given Akshay an idea: how about Indian men and women cricketers coming together to form one teamLike there are mixed doubles in tennis, why cant there be a men and women cricket match against another country Why cant they have mixed cricket teams where six Indian men and six Indian women play against Australias six men and six women If this kind of a set-up happens, it will be the biggest set-up ever, says Akshay.The actor not only rooted for the Indian womens team but also met them after the match. I was talking to the girls and one of them said that it would be so much fun if Virat Kohli ran from one side and a lady was on the other side [of the batting pitch], he says.    Even Broken Hearts Can Laugh!! These Women have started a Revolution and I couldn't be more proud  #WWC17Final  A post shared by Akshay Kumar (@akshaykumar) on Jul 23, 2017 at 11:17am PDT How did the idea come to him I was watching a Wimbledon [tennis] match on my phone recently and this idea just struck me, he says, and adds laughing, On the train.The actor, who has been training women in self-defence free of cost for the past three years, feels that the Indian womens cricket team no longer needs to be seen as underdogs. Now they dont require any [more] encouragement. Trust me, they have arrived. I watched them play and it was revolutionary. I met them and I told them that they had reasons to be sad but no reason to give up, says Akshay.Follow @htshowbiz for more
