Delhi man kills pregnant wife for not making round rotis.
In Delhi's Jahangirpuri , a 22-year-old pregnant woman was murdered by her husband for an absurd reason. Because she could not make perfectly round chapatis.Simran and her husband got into a fight on Saturday during which he kicked her in the stomach. When the couple's four-year-daughter tried to save Simran, she was dragged into another room and locked up. He later then strangled Simran to death. It was on Sunday around 4 am that Simran's brother found her lying unconscious in her flat and called the police. The daughter told the police that her parents often fought about her mother's chapatis. "My mother was a good cook but the chapati shape angered my father," she said as reported by TOI .
