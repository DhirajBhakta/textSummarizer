Congratulations on winning @RenaultIndia MTV #RoadiesRising @NehaDhupia pic.twitter.com/wZvbejRVTk MTV India (@MTVIndia) July 22, 2017I had auditioned for Roadies thrice in the past, but did not make it to the show. But failing thrice did not dampen my spirits. I took the challenge head-on and auditioned again, only with the intention of winning the show. And I did win it, Shweta said in a statement.This definitely feels amazing. Roadies is a cult show and being associated with such a show and winning it feels out of the world. Neha maam wanted a girl to win this season and I feel proud that I didnt disappoint her, she added.
