Filmmaker's plea to end 40-year-old rape case rejected.
A judge in Los Angeles has rejected Oscar-winning filmmaker-actor Roman Polanski's plea to resolve his 40-year-old rape case.Polanski's plea was heard on Monday, reports variety.com.In a 13-page ruling, judge Scott Gordon found that Polanski cannot put the case behind him so long as he refuses to return to the US and submit to the court's jurisdiction."Polanski cannot avail himself of the court while standing in contempt of it," Gordon wrote.California courts have repeatedly held that Polanski cannot litigate the case from afar.The famed director fled the US in 1978 after pleading guilty to raping a 13-year-old girl. His attorneys have said that judge Laurence Rittenband engaged in misconduct by revoking on a pledge not to sentence Polanski to prison time, the website said.Polanski is a citizen of France and is not subject to extradition there. The Los Angeles County District Attorney's office has repeatedly sought to extradite him when he travels to other countries but without success.Resolving the case would allow the 83-year-old director to travel more freely and to return to the US.
