Sacking Dhoni as Pune captain a third-rate decision: Azhar.
Former India skipper Mohammad Azharuddin has lashed out at the Rising Pune Supergiants franchise for sacking Mahendra Singh Dhoni as captain of the team for the upcoming tenth season of the Indian Premier League."The decision and manner of execution was third-rate and disgraceful. Dhoni has been a jewel in Indian cricket, he has won almost everything in the 8-9 years of his captaincy and even though the franchise can say they run the team with their own money, shouldn't they have seen Dhoni's stature and credibility before first stripping him of captaincy and then not even letting Dhoni the grace I feel angry and sad as a former cricketer," Azhar told Aaj Tak.

"What will a captain do when the team doesn't play well If Dhoni wasn't a good and an inspirational captain would he have won two IPL titles (leading Chennai Super Kings) Belittling Indian sporting legends like Dhoni through corporate board rooms is stooping down to the lowest," Azhar said.
