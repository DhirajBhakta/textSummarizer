Salman, Aamir will run after 21-year-old heroines: Raveena.
Every 90s kid has grown up watching and loving the cult classic Andaz Apna Apna, which never fails to evoke laughs, even over two decades since it released. When BollywoodLife asked Raveena Tandon if she would want to be a part of the sequel to her popular film, her response was hilarious. She took a friendly jibe at her co-stars Aamir Khan and Salman Khan, and their tendency to work with younger actresses.Tongue in cheek, Raveena said, "I would love to be game for it, but I know that my photograph is going to be hanging there. Aamir and Salman will be garlanding me and Lolo (Karisma Kapoor) and saying 'hamaari biwiyaan mar gayi, ab kya karein' And then they will be running after 21-year-old heroines. So that's how the sequel is gonna start (sic)."
