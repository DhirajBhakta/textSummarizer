Mumbai education society digitises 7 schools and colleges.
Bandra?s Rizvi Education Society, which manages seven institutes including schools and colleges, recently implemented the first phase of digital transformation of its education and administration system. The institutes now have technology-driven teaching interface in all classrooms, bio-metric entry for students, paperless admissions and mobile apps for better teacher-parent interaction. The education society also plans to introduce online assessment of all examinations soon.?Paperless admissions have not only reduced the work of our staff but have also made the process very transparent for everybody. Parents are also happy as they get daily updates about their child?s attendance in college without even having to visit the institute,? said AH Rizvi, president, Rizvi Education Society. The society spent around Rs1 crore and took seven months to implement the first phase.He added that in the second phase, the education society plans to start online assessment of exam papers and make study material available online for all its 6,000 school and college students.The management trained its teachers in collaboration with a technology provider to ensure the final implementation is foolproof.  Also, CCTV cameras were installed in all its institutes and all laboratories were equipped with latest technology. ?Our attempt to digitise almost all our academic functions right from admissions to the generation of results has been very fruitful. We intend to digitise the infrastructure, administration as well as teaching-learning process to ensure a 360 degree effort,? said Rubina Rizvi, director, Rizvi Education Society.
