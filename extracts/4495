Just one bad day for India: Anil Kumble defends the team.
India coach Anil Kumble gave a measured response on Friday after his team's spectacular collapse against Australia in the opening Test, calling it just one bad day for his world No. 1 team.Replying to Australia's 260, India, unbeaten in their previous 19 Tests, lost their last seven wickets for 11 runs to be bundled out for 105 in their first innings.

It was disappointing," former India captain and leg-spinner Kumble told reporters.

But once Rahul got out, we lost those four wickets in five or six balls. That certainty pushed us back," he said, referring to the pitch as "challenging".The hosts also dropped four catches in Australia's second innings, including three missed chances with world No. 1 batsman Steve Smith to compound their problems.

India are staring at a steep four-innings target on a wicket providing prodigious turn for the spin bowlers.Kumble was backing his side, who have won their last six series, to chase down any target."We would like to restrict them to as little as possible (on Saturday)," Kumble said. "We dropped a few catches. It has hurt us in the past, especially in this game you need to hold your chances even if half chances."
