Faisal Amjad (@FaisalAmjad1) July 9, 2017Was total disaster,for someone who made his name in Bollywood(at least on sheer numbers) it was disrespectful from him,even speaking Tamil?

Jagruti (@JCookingOdyssey) July 9, 2017However, Twitter user @musicaloud tweeted that he was at the concert himself and the set list of songs had 16 Hindi songs and 12 in Tamil.The set list from yesterday night #arr #wembley pic.twitter.com/PggTDqJJi6? MusicAloud (@MusicAloud) July 9, 2017Rahman, who won the Oscar in 2009 for his work in Danny Boyle?s Slumdog Millionaire, accepted the award on stage with a speech in Tamil. He was born in Chennai and is also called the Mozart of Madras. He may be best known for his work in Bollywood films but he has also composed music for films in several other languages. His first project was the Tamil original, Roja.Even Rahman?s concert was titled Netru Indru Naalai, Tamil for ?yesterday, today, tomorrow.?Several other fans of the musician flocked to his defence on Twitter and schooled those complaining how this is a classic example of ?imposing Hindi? on South Indians.AR Rahman performs Tamil songs, did'nt perform any in Hindi. Not able to tolerate an hour of music in another language #stopHindiImposition pic.twitter.com/UCQDhCiOQh?
