The textile industry in hubs like Bhiwandi, Ichalkaranji and Malegaon has been complaining about similar inflated bills over the years. But the government has not bothered to take any cognisance of the matter. But in this case, they have immediately ordered an inquiry. This government is only for stars and celebrities," said Samajwadi Party MLA Abu Asim Azmi.
