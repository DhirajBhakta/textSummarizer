Uday Shinde and Swapnali Shinde got married on Tuesday morning.  The couple completed the primary rituals and then marched towards the IDBS school polling booth to cast their vote while the guests and relatives waited for them."Voting is not only a right but my duty as a citizen. We completed the primary rituals of marriage and then proceeded towards the polling booth to cast our vote.Some relatives objected to us leaving the rituals mid way, but we convinced them and finally were allowed to go to the polling booth," Uday told India Today. "We have been facing so many civic issues like bad roads, water crisis, pollution but to put an end to these problems one needs to vote. My husband and I had decided that we will surely cast our vote and as soon as the rings were exchanged we left the wedding hall to reach the polling booth," said Swapnali.PARALYSIS DID NOT DETER THIS WOMANFor many their circumstances did not deter their willingness to vote and look forward to change. Shobha Khotkar (59) who has been paralysed below waist, came to the IDBS School in Bhandup to cast her vote. "If I don't cast my vote, I have no right to complain against the civic authorities. We need better roads, open spaces, parks and better infrastructure facilities in the city. Casting my vote ensures that I have performed my duty, now it is the elected representative who has to deliver," said Khotar. The voting percentage at this booth by noon was around fifteen percent.Also read:
