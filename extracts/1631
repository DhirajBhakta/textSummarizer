Modi will run back to Gujarat like a son of a rat: TMC MP.
Trinamool Congress MP Kalyan Banerjee today went berserk attacking Prime Minister Narendra Modi over demonetisation and recent arrests of his party leaders in connection with a chit fund scam. "Modi's supporters call him a lion. But I say time is not far when Modi will have to return to his hole in Gujarat like a son of a rat," Banerjee said during a protest rally in Kolkata.Talking to India Today later, Banerjee refused to apologise for his abusive language against the prime minister and accused the media of speaking only in favour of PM Modi. He justified his comment stating that it was Prime Minister Modi who had started the trend of using derogatory words against Opposition leaders.Speaking at the same stage, Bengal Chief Minister and Trinamool chief Mamata Banerjee further endorsed her MP's comments against the PM. Mamata too used the "rat" analogy to slam the Narendra Modi government."They thought TMC is on soft mud so let's uproot them. When the mud's soft, even rats try pushing through. But remember, Trinamool Congress stands firm on fertile soil, we don't get rattled by rats. We fight against tigers," Mamata said.  The BJP has lodged a complaint against Kalyan Banerjee. The Mamata Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress launched a three-day countrywide protest on Monday (January 9) demanding removal of PM Narendra Modi to "save the country"."Trinamool Congress is organising nationwide protest against Modi Babu's shameless flop-show," Banerjee had said in Kolkata.Banerjee on January 6 called for President Pranab Mukherjee's intervention to "save the country" and mooted a National Government headed by BJP veteran LK Advani or Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley or Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh.
