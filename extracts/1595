Semi-paralysed man digs out motorable road in three years .
Eighteen years ago, Sasi Gangadharan, a coconut tree climber from the outskirts of Kerala's Thiruvananthapuram district, fell down from a coconut tree. The fall paralysed the right side of his body and he was bed-ridden for years, with no job or source of income. Sasi reached out to the panchayat to help him with a three-wheeler to set up a small business, but they turned down his repeated requests stating that there is no motorable road till his house. Seeing his plea falling on deaf years, the semi-paralysed man decided to make things work, all by himself. The 59-year-old man got his hands on a pickaxe, a shovel, and carved out a 200-metre stretch of kachha road through the plateau, working 6 hours daily for the past three years.  Talking to India Today, Sasi said, "the old route to my house was from above that plateau. I used to slip and fall, my clothes tore. That is when I requested the panchayat to give me a three wheeler so that I could go do some small business. They said what's the point in giving you the vehicle when you have no road there?"Omana, Sasi's wife told India Today, "he did all this by himself without any help from the panchayat or the neighbours. But then there were people who complained that he was causing them trouble, that he is selling the mud he is digging out." Sasi even had cases filed against him for causing nuisance to the neighbours by digging the plateau.
