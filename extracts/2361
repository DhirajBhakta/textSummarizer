Alia doesn't need my guidance to choose films: Soni Razdan.
Soni Razdan is proud of daughter, actor Alia Bhatts professional choices. With hits such as Udta Punjab, Kapoor and Sons, and Dear Zindagi, she believes that Alias success proves that she is on the right path. Soni feels that the only thing that  her daughter needs to do now is continue with her hard work. Alia doesnt need my guidance regarding the kind of films she should do. Rather, she is quite a sorted individual who follows a strong instinct. And this seems to have worked in her favour. We [Soni, Alias father Mahesh Bhatt and her sister Shaheen Bhatt] are all proud of what she has done for herself at such a young age (Alia is 24 now). She should just stay dedicated to her craft and the rest will fall in place. As her mother, I am always there, but Alia knows what she wants both professionally and personally, says the actor-director, who has been a part of films such as Saaransh (1984), Sadak (1991) and Monsoon Wedding (2001).

But if you ask me to choose the ones I loved, I would say she impressed me with her performances in Udta Punjab, Highway and Dear Zindagi (2016). But as I always say an actor is never bigger than her role. So I feel she is lucky to have got such opportunities. Also, what I liked is that in each of these films, Alia was different. That is commendable, she adds.Follow @htshowbiz for more
