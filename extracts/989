Was a reply to someone: Siddiqui on tweet about skin colour.
Bollywood actor Nawazuddin Siddiquis recent cryptic tweet created a furore as it hinted at him being discriminated in the film industry on the basis of his skin colour.He had tweeted, Thank U 4 making me realise dat I cannot b paired along wid d fair & handsome bcz I m dark & not good looking, but I never focus on that. (sic)Thank U 4 making me realise dat I cannot b paired along wid d fair & handsome bcz I m dark & not good looking, but I never focus on that. Nawazuddin Siddiqui (@Nawazuddin_S) July 17, 2017The 43-year-old, however, has now clarified that his tweet was just a reply. I tweeted what I felt. Someone had said something to me and that tweet is a reply to that, he said during a press conference of Munna Michael. When asked if the whole industry is like that, the Raees star said, No, the industry is not like that. But that person belongs to the industry, whose reply I have given. I have been hearing that since childhood but still I am still here and the industry has accepted me. When I was young and I expressed my desire to become an actor, people around me said, Have you looked at yourself. Even later, when I used to go to offices in Mumbai, everyone used to tell me that I dont look like an actor. So these things are there everywhere, not just in Bollywood.His co-star Tiger Shroff, while talking on the same issue, said, Nawaz sir has a huge fan following and wherever I go with him, female fans are more eager to meet the Gangs Of Wasseypur star as they are crazy about him. Its fascinating that women are crazy about Nawaz sir. Follow @htshowbiz for more
