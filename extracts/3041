Beef festival organised in Aizawl as Rajnath visits Mizoram.
Opposing the recent notification of the Centre banning sale of cattle for slaughter in animal markets, which is being widely perceived as beef ban, some activists today organised a beef festival in Mizoram capital Aizawl. The beef festival coincides with the visit of Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh, who arrived in Aizawl today to hold a meeting of chief ministers of the states sharing borders with Mynamar.The security arrangement for Rajnath Singh's visit to Aizawl was beefed up in the wake of beef festival organised by ZOlife Group and some activists. The organisers promoted the event on Facebook asking people to attend the beef festival at Vanapa Hall in Aizawl. It was scheduled for 2 pm today.CAUSE OF CONCERN FOR BJPThe opposition to the Centre's notification assumes political significance for the BJP, which is focusing on improving its presence in the entire North-East. Remruata Varte, one of the organizers said that the entire state stands together in opposing the 'beef ban' by BJP government at the Centre.Beef is an integral part of the food habits of the people in the region and no one will compromise for the same, Varte said.This of course comes as a big set-back for the BJP leaders who have been camping in the region trying to garner support for impending elections in the state. Earlier, protests were witnessed in Meghalaya against the Centre's notification for ban on sale of cattle for slaughter at animal markets.(Photo credit: Lal Hmingmawia and Remruata Varte in Aizawl, Mizoram) ALSO READ |
