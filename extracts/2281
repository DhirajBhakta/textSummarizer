The Wimbledon singles are over for another year. Garbine Muguruza is the womens champion, while fresh-faced Roger Federer is the ruler of the mens game again. Federer has made history again. Eight Wimbledon titles in the bag, now its time for him to win his 20th grand slam title. Next stop: New York. And with Andy Murray and Novak Djokovic nursing injuries, theres maybe only one man who can stop Federer from rounding up his tally at the US Open. You know who I mean. Hes a Spaniard with a very big forehand and an obsession with perfectly ordered water bottles. Anyway, thats all from me today. As ever, thank you for reading and emailing over the past fortnight. Bye!Updated

Roger Federer speaks. It is cruel sometimes, but he fought well and hes a hero, so congratulations on a wonderful tournament, Marin. You should be really proud. You had a wonderful tournament and sometimes you dont just see great in a final. Ive got to take more time off, I dont know. Im going to be gone again for the next six months. Better than winning this trophy is being healthy. Im feeling great. The tournament Ive played, not dropping a set, its magical. Its too much. Its belief that I can achieve such heights. I wasnt sure if I was going to be here after last year. I had some tough ones, losing to Novak. I kept on believing and dreaming and here I am today with the eighth. Its fantastic. Its such a special court. So many legends have marked this court, the womens game, the mens game, mixed, doubles. From day one to finals day, Centre Court is always packed and its a dream to play here. I hope I can come back next year to try to defend the title.

Marin Cilic speaks. I never gave up when I started a match. That was my idea today. I gave my best and thats all I could do. I had an amazing journey here. I played the best tennis of my life. I want to thank my team, they gave so much strength to me. It was really tough today and Im hoping Im going to come back here and try one more time.

Roger Federers name is on the trophy here. He just needs to add the final few flourishes. History beckons. His heart is beating that little bit faster as he walks to the baseline to serve. Cilic, like a condemned man heading to the gallows, takes his place, ready to return. The suns come out at last. Of course it has. But Federer still needs some points. He loses the first, sending a backhand long. 0-15. But he steadies himself with an accurate serve. Another one makes it 30-15 and he gees himself up with some Swiss-German. He has two championship points when Cilic screws a forehand return off to the right. Applause. Silence. A missed first serve. A rally. Its not over yet. Cilic finds the angles to force Federer to hit a forehand long. 40-30. Federer misses another first serve. Theres only one thing for it: a second-serve ace down the middle. Thats it! Roger Federer is the Wimbledon champion again! He looks very emotional, almost in tears, but he remembers that theres a man whos feeling a fair bit more emotional than him right now and he walks to the net to shake hands with poor Marin Cilic. Its all over. Federer is the owner of an historic eight Wimbledon titles and a mere 19 majors overall. Take that, Rafa.Updated

Third set: Cilic* 3-6, 1-6, 4-5 Federer (*denotes server): Cilic is serving to stay in the final, although he in reality he left it spiritually a long time ago. He is, however, determined to make Federer serve for it. His fifth ace of the match sets him up for a rare simple hold, even though there is the blemish of a double-fault. Federer will serve with new balls for his 19th grand slam title. Given this has been such an anti-climax, and is finishing so quickly, do you think they could ask Federer to knock up against one of those back-walls, so we get to see a bit more of him playing on centre court says David Wall. Even he can only have a couple more years on the tour and itll leave an enormous hole when he does retire.Updated

Third set: Cilic* 3-6, 1-6, 3-4 Federer (*denotes server): Cilic sends down an ace to make it 15-0, but its 15-30 when he flicks a backhand wide. He challenges to no avail. Then he nets a forehand, even though Federer was stranded on the baseline. Two break points. They double up as championship points. And it really is Federers to lose now. Cilic wheels into another forehand ... and dumps it into that blasted net. Federer is two games away from his eighth Wimbledon title.

3.38pm BST

Third set: Cilic 3-6, 1-6, 3-3 Federer* (*denotes server): Federer sails through another service game. It feels as though Cilics best hope is a tie-break.

Third set: Cilic* 3-6, 1-6, 3-2 Federer (*denotes server): Cilic holds with an ace out wide. He clenches his fist, glaring at his box, resolve and steel returning. You forget athletes are humans with real emotions. The sport of tennis is so hard because you're out there all by yourself.Updated

Third set: Cilic 3-6, 1-6, 2-2 Federer* (*denotes server): Hes obviously not winning this and its a terrible final, but Id say Cilic has done a lot to enhance his reputation in the past few games. It would have been very easy for him to throw in the towel. But Federers still so miserly, scrooge-like when hes serving. He offers Cilic false hope by letting this game drift to deuce - the drama! - but he still holds.

Third set: Cilic* 3-6, 1-6, 2-1 Federer (*denotes server): Alarm bells are ringing when Cilic spoofs a forehand into the net for 0-30. Somehow, though, he fights to 40-30, one backhand winner taking the breath away. This is gutsy from a man who is enduring some very public turmoil. Unfortunately the chap on the other side of the net is not making this any easier, making it deuce with a searing crosscourt backhand, earning a break point when Cilic nets a forehand. Admirably Cilic saves it with some serve-volley. Then he holds. This hurts, but tanking would hurt even more. Is this a record for unforced errors says Henry C. I feel sorry for Cilic but has got to be one of the worst finals ever. Hoping that something will change, but it is saying something when the first two sets lasted less than the Womens final.Updated

Third set: Cilic 3-6, 1-6, 1-1 Federer* (*denotes server): Federer lopes forward off a second serve, planting a deft backhand volley out of reach for 15-0. He holds to 15. No mercy. Theres no room for the stuff at this level.

Federer leads 15-0 when Cilic sends a forehand return wide. Its 30-0 when he attacks a short return with a whipped forehand. Soon he has three set points. He takes the first with a swinging ace down the middle. I dont mean to be insensitive, but this is the worst mens final for a long time. The doctor is back on court.Updated

Second set: Cilic* 3-6, 1-5 Federer (*denotes server): Cilic is now using serve-and-volley on every point, which is enough to make you think he isnt interested in long rallies. Hes drawn into one at 40-30, though, and he nets a forehand for deuce. Federers not going to give him anything now. He gives a second serve the treatment, a sweet backhand return earning him a break point. Federer cant take it, though, knocking a return miles wide and challenging the call for absolutely no reason at all. But when Cilic sends down an 134mph serve, Federers flicked return brings up a second break point. Federer knocks a backhand down the line, the stretching Cilic hangs out his racket and volleys long. Federer will serve for a two-set lead. Updated

Second set: Cilic 3-6, 1-4 Federer* (*denotes server): Of course, its one way to get the crowd on your side when youre playing Federer. The sympathy vote. Its not going to knock Federer off course, though, as he holds to 15. They retreat to their chairs. Theres no sign of Cilic requiring any more treatment.

3.02pm BST
15:02

Second set: Cilic* 3-6, 1-3 Federer (*denotes server): Another cheer for Cilic when he wins the first point of this game with a big serve. The game goes to 30-all. The last time I saw something like this in a grand slam final was when Sabine Lisicki collapsed emotionally in the 2013 final. Its not clear if hes distressed or physically hurting. But he does manage to hold to 30, keeping this final alive.Updated

The medical team and supervisors have left the court. It seems that Cilic, who was bawling his eyes out a moment or two ago, is going to continue. He doesnt want this to end early. But this is awful to see, even though hes given a huge ovation by the crowd as he prepares to serve.Updated

Second set: Cilic* 3-6, 0-2 Federer (*denotes server): Cilic makes himself feel a bit better with an ace for 30-15. Its not long before Federer has a break point, though, with Cilics game in danger of coming apart at the seams. The errors keep on coming. Cilic pulls a backhand wide and Federer leads by a set and a break.

2.50pm BST

Second set: Cilic 3-6, 0-1 Federer* (*denotes server): The good news for Marin Cilic is that this isnt over yet. The bad news is that Federer hasnt lost a grand slam match from a set up since the 2014 Wimbledon final. Hes such a strong frontrunner. Thats probably why Cilic hit his chair with his racket during the changeover. He suspects this final might already be running away from him. Federer begins the set with a straightforward hold to love.Updated

Serving to stay in the set, Cilics pulled back to 30-all from 30-0. He decides its time to serve and volley, but he sets Federer up for a backhand pass, which is a bit like showing Leo Messi on to his left foot. Set point. A big serve forces Federer to return wide, but an errant forehand from Cilic brings up a second set point. Cilic is showing signs of strain. He misses a first serve. His second serve clips the top of the net and skitters wide to gift Federer the first set! That was all a bit flat.Updated

First set: Cilic* 3-4 Federer (*denotes server): Cilic gambols into a 40-0 lead. Federer makes it 40-15 with a crisp forehand return down the line, then 40-30 with a preposterous, hypnotic backhand drop shot that draws a deeply satisfied sigh from the crowd. Suddenly theres uncertainty in Cilic. From a position of dominance, its deuce after a double-fault, the class of Federer unsettling the Croatian. Fortunately for Cilic, Federer cant take advantage. He holds to keep the distance between them to a single break.Updated

First set: Cilic 2-4 Federer* (*denotes server): With Federer ahead, Cilic looks to haul himself back into the set with some aggressive hitting. Federers backhand slice seems to head wide - its called out - but the umpire overrules the line judge. The points replayed, Federer skips into a 15-0 lead and its 40-0 before Cilic has time to regroup. Federer clinches his first hold to love without any problems at all in the end, but that could have been a much tougher game.

2.32pm BST
14:32

First set: Cilic* 2-3 Federer (*denotes server): Trailing 0-15, Cilic goes for a drop shot. Federer reads it. The 35-year-old springs forward to dink. Cilic hurtles forward, prods a backhand from left to right and falls heavily, leaving the court open for Federer to dab a backhand away for 0-30! That exchange seems to take the wind out of Cilic, whos facing three break points after an awful forehand. He saves the first two, Federers returns drifting long. Not the third, though. Cilic doesnt move his feet and he nets a poor backhand to hand the first break to Federer. Could the Prime Ministers presence be a bad omen for fans of Roger Federer says David Wall. Shes been poison for what seemed to be sure-things in recent times. Will Federer end up shedding a solitary tearUpdated

First set: Cilic 2-2 Federer* (*denotes server): Cilic is starting to use his power to good effect, returning heavily and drawing an error from Federer for 0-15. Its tense. Federers second double-fault of the match makes it 30-all. Hitting deep, Cilic is starting to boss a few rallies. A penetrative backhand makes Federer net a slice, bringing up the first break point. Federer nets a first serve. He goes for a body serve with the second, though, and Cilic stiffs a backhand into the net. The game goes to deuce and Federer ends up holding to considerable relief around Centre Court.

First set: Cilic 1-1 Federer* (*denotes server): We begin with a see-saw rally, Federer on top at first and making most of the running before Cilic takes control with a big forehand down the line, forcing the Swiss to net a backhand. A smooth serve makes it 15-all. But Cilic appears to have shaken off the nerves. He repels a big first serve and asserts himself with a huge forehand for 15-30. Sensing danger, the crowd cheers when Federer makes it 30-all at the net. The game goes to deuce after Federers first double-fault, but he holds. Theres a lot of nervous energy out there.

2.14pm BST
14:14

First set: Cilic* 1-0 Federer (*denotes server): Here we go, the 131st mens singles final, with Marin Cilic serving first after Roger Federer elected to receive. It begins. Cilic sees a second serve rammed down his throat and dribbles a forehand into the net to make it 0-15. A purposeful, urgent start from Federer, while Cilic looks a little tight, slamming a forehand long to make it 15-30. The Croatians nervy. Hes grateful to see Federer miss a couple of backhands, but the game goes to deuce when Cilic slaps a forehand into the net. Heres early pressure. But Cilic does well to deal with it and hold. A break there would have been sub-optimal.Updated

I asked this about yesterdays final as both women carried their own bags onto court (as well as their flowers), yet today the men are having their bags carried for them, says David Wall. Did Mugaruza and Williams just chose to carry their own gear then, or have they stopped offering that to the women I think its a good tradition, theyre in the final so should get all the special treatment going (in fact Im disappointed there arent rose bearers casting petals in front of the players for them to walk on).I have no idea, David, but its a good question.

Its nothing new for Federer, of course, and he looks so relaxed. Hes seen it all before. Eventually they emerge to a huge ovation. The camera doesnt linger long on Cilic, whos smiling slightly.

What a match between the British-Japanese pair and De Groot and Buis, says Chris Page. That it is Whiley and Kamijis fourth consecutive Wimbledon doubles title. They lost the first set 6-2, but there was no doubt in my mind that they would come back to win. Theyre almost telepathic. They took the second set comfortably, then the third was a 6-0 walk-over - including a 30 stroke rally! Follow that, Roger and Marin...If you havent treated yourself to the delights of wheelchair tennis before, youre missing out. Its a terrifically absorbing sport: physical, skilled, inventive.

Hello. Its interesting. If youre actually at Wimbledon, you dont actually have to watch a Roger Federer match to know how its going. You dont even have to listen the umpire calling out the score after each point. All you need to do is stand outside Centre Court and listen to the crowd. If theyre in a state of unbridled glee verging on pure lust, if theyre oohing and aahing and panting and fawning after every point, you can safely interpret that as Federer dominance. Enthusiastic applause: Federers won the point. Grudging applause: the other blokes not playing ball.This is how its supposed to go. This is Federers kingdom, his palace from palace. Theres no desire for him to be pushed too hard. Theres no interest in an upset. Sure, its nice to see Federers opponent muster some defiance, just to keep the show going for as long as possible, but hes not actually supposed to win. Hes supposed to be a good boy, know his place, let the master do as he pleases and lose in straight sets. You are the comedy sidekick, there to be willingly loaded into a cannon, to have a custard pie slammed in your face and raise no objections; take it, its all youre good for here. This is the deal. There might be some pretence from the crowd that theyd like to see something resembling a contest, some confected jeopardy, like a tie-break in the first set, which is really about as dangerous and adventurous as splashing out on the Creuset pan instead of the John Lewis own brand (other brands are available). The Fed-lust can only stand so much risk.Centre Court, in all its stuffy blazered glory, really just wants to bask in reverie for Roger. Hes nice like Tim, but hes even better at tennis. Andy is stubborn and pretty brilliant, so hes an excellent alternative. Novak is mysterious and brutal, but he can be a bit bad-tempered. Rafa is sweet and amazing and Spanish, a fine young man, ever so handsome, but he isnt an artist. None of them turn up on court wearing a cardigan or a blazer - thats true class. None of them are Roger. They love Roger. WE LOVE YOU ROGER. I LOVE YOU ROGER. MARRY ME ROGER. Did I say that out loud Oh, what am I like!This is what stands in front of Marin Cilic today: Federer the player and Federer the legend. He isnt supposed to win. Its not that the seventh seed isnt an interesting player, of course, or incapable of playing the kind of tennis that could urinate all over the eagerly anticipated Swiss coronation. Its just that he isnt Roger. Nor is the former US Open champion much of a character, a card. Hes just a guy whos good at tennis. Unlike Goran Ivanisevic, the last Croatian man to win Wimbledon, theres no Good Marin, Bad Marin and Emergency Marin. Theres just Marin. It might not be enough to win their affections.It could be enough to win this final, though. Cilic is playing excellent grass-court tennis this year and he crushed Federer on the way to winning the US Open in 2014. At his best, shorn of nerves and anxiety, he is a mighty proposition. If the 28-year-old doesnt freeze, he could do something here. He was two sets up against Federer in their quarter-final last year. Underestimate him at your peril. But for all that it has been possible to catch a few signs of Federer frailty over the past fortnight, he still won that match and he still hasnt really come close to dropping a set at this tournament. And last year he had that knee injury. This time hes well rested, having worked out how best to protect his physical resources after that knee injury, and hes been untouchable this year, playing quick, sharp-shooting, ask-no-questions tennis that is intended to kill the argument as quickly as possible. Its brought him another Australian Open title, his 18th major, and titles in Miami and Indian Wells. It could bring him an historic eighth Wimbledon title.This is Cilics second grand slam final. Its Federers 11th here and his 29th overall. Hes 36 in less than a month. This isnt normal. But he isnt normal. You wonder when its going to end. Is it going to end You know what they want on Centre Court. More Roger. They cant get enough Roger. And do you know Its because theres nothing else quite like it.Play begins at: 2pm BST.Updated
