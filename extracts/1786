The Samajwadi drama refuses to end. Moments after  party general secretary Ram Gopal Yadav announced Akhilesh Yadav as party's national president and declared Mulayam Singh as the supreme guide or margdarshak of the party, the veteran leader shot back expelling Ram Gopal from the party for six years.Mulayam has expelled Ram Gopal for the second time in last three days. The party's founder leader has also called a party convention on January 5 in Janeshwar Mishra Park. At the party's national executive meet earlier today in Lucknow party Ram Gopal Yadav proposed Akhilesh Yadav's name for party president post. The meeting which was termed 'unconstitutional' by party founder Mulayam also saw Ram Gopal proposing removal of Shivpal Yadav from state unit's chief and ouster of Amar Singh. There was a roar of approval when Ramgopal Yadav proposed that Akhilesh Yadav be the new national working president and also declared that Shivpal Yadav would no more be the state party president.Shortly after Ramgopal's announcements, Akhilesh said he continued to regard netaji (Mulayam Singh) as his father but spoke harshly against uncle Shivpal. Both Akhilesh and Ramgopal were expelled for six years from the Samajwadi Party by Mulayam Singh on Friday (December 30). The decision was revoked a day later - ahead of the today's convention.
