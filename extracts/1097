Plus I needed an actor of his age. The amount of energy he could send to the role I couldn't think of anybody else." said Masurkar."Raj is extremely dedicated guy. He is with you one hundred per cent. And, I would love to work with him in more films," he added. Amit had also confirmed that the movie will release in mid-2017.
