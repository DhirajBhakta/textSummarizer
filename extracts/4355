Warren Beatty unsung hero of Oscars night: Oscars producer.
Los Angeles, Mar 5 (PTI) Actor Warren Beatty has been praised for how he handled the Oscars Best Picture drama by the shows producer Michael De Luca. The 79-year-old actor and his "Bonnie & Clyde" co-star Faye Dunaway, 76, were given the wrong envelope at the Academy Awards last month, leading Faye to mistakenly announce "La La Land" as the winner, instead of "Moonlight". And the Oscars producer believes Warren is the "unsung hero" of the night, according to The Hollywood Reporter. Referring to when Warren hesitated and showed Faye the card with the winners name, Michael says, "I actually think Warren Beatty is the unsung hero here, completely heroic. I think he was showing her (Dunaway) the card, like, hey are you seeing what Im seeing? I think a mistakes been made here. To me, they are heroes and completely in the clear." And Michael believes PricewaterhouseCoopers accountant Brian Cullinan, who handed Warren the wrong envelope, and his colleague Martha Ruiz, could have done more to smooth things over. "If I was in that job, and I know Im Monday morning quarterbacking, which I detest, but I feel like if its my one job, if I heard the wrong name, Id walk directly to Warren Beatty and say you got the wrong envelope, heres the right envelope, and make a charming moment out of it."
