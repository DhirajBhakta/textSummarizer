An off-duty Delhi police constable was shot at and another was hit with a pistol butt in a case of road rage in Narela on Wednesday night. The victims have been admitted to a city hospital and hunt is on for the accused.   The incident took place in front of the main gate of a housing colony in Narela when the two men   Constable Pawan Kumar and constable Vikash  who were in their private vehicle asked a man in a Fortuner to move his car. This angered the driver. He took out a pistol and shot Pawan in his leg. He hit the second constable with the pistol butt, said DCP Rohini Rishi Pal. The driver also boasted that he is gangster Monu Dabodia. Police suspect that the accused could be related to slain gangster Neetu Dabodia who was in the list of top Delhi criminals.
