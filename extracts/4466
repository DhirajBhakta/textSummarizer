JD(U) to contest against AAP in MCD polls.
New Delhi, Feb 26 (PTI) Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar will address two rallies in the national capital ahead of the municipal polls, where JD(U) will contest all the 272 seats, taking on the AAP on its home turf. The partys Delhi in-charge Sanjay Jha announced it an event where few district-level Aam Aadmi Party workers, mainly from east Delhi, joined JD(U), accusing the AAP of neglecting Poorvanchalis in MCD ticket distribution. Jha said JD(U) aims to tap the "discontent" among the AAPs poorvanchali voters base. He said the Poorvanchalis here have been "let down" by the Arvind Kejriwal government despite having extended every possible backing to it over the last two years. "Nitish Kumar will address two rallies, one each in north and south Delhi after Holi. The first list of our candidates will be out within a week," he said. BJPs decision to appoint Bhojpuri artiste Manoj Tiwari as its Delhi unit chief is also being seen as an attempt to woo the Poorvanchali community, comprising the people from the eastern part of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. The Delhi unit of JD(U) was constituted during Kumars visit here on December 3 last year. Jha brushed aside Kumars perceived closeness with Kejriwal, saying JD(U) will work for expanding its base and work towards ensuring "fair" representation of the Poorvanchali population. AAP had supported JD(U) in the 2015 Bihar Assembly polls and the two parties often cooperate in Parliament.
