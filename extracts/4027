I am dating but I feel single: Arbaaz on relationship status.
When Arbaaz Khan and Malaika Arora announced their decision to end their 17-year-long marriage, it sent shockwaves through the industry. Even as speculation was rife that a reconciliation was on the cards, given their frequent outings and parties together, it was not meant to be. Arbaaz opened up in an interview with DNA and said that there was no chance of them getting back together. "I guess if that was to happen it would have happened in the first six months, or one year. It didn't and it's been almost three years now," he said.He added, "I wouldn't want to speak for her. I kept my option open despite us parting ways, and I gave it a little time, whether it was a year or two years before I moved on in certain ways. Even as far as dating somebody is concerned."Arbaaz was also linked to a mystery girl who was a frequent feature in his Instagram photos. While he said that Yellow (the woman he was rumoured to be in a relationship with) is just a friend, the actor admitted that he is dating someone. "I am dating, yes. But we are not... As of now, there is still a long way to go," he said.At ' Go with the flow ' with the lovely @yellowmehra ð super lunch, great chat, wonderful time ðA post shared by Arbaaz Khan (@arbaazkhanofficial) on Jul 20, 2016 at 4:26am PDT
