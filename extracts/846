Didn't quit Twitter after reactions on GoT cameo: Sheeran.
Singer Ed Sheeran insists he didn?t quit Twitter because of the negative reaction to his Game of Thrones cameo and says it was just a coincidence.The 26-year-old Galway Girl hitmaker says he isn?t worried about what other people think of his role.?Last I?ll say on this. I came off Twitter Coz I was always intending to come off Twitter, had nothing to do with what people said about my game of thrones cameo, because I am in game of thrones, why the hell would I worry what people thought about that. It?s clearly awesome. Timing was just a coincidence, but believe what you want (sic),? reads a post on his Instagram.This comes after the episode?s director Jeremy Podeswa defended Sheeran?s appearance.?I think Ed did a lovely job - he?s a lovely actor and a lovely person. He was appropriate for the part because he needed to sing. If people didn?t know who Ed was, they wouldn?t have thought about it twice.?Follow @htshowbiz for more
