Haven't thought that much ahead: Varun on marrying Natasha.
Although Varun Dhawan has never announced that he is dating Natasha Dalal, their relationship is an open secret. The actor opened up about his relationship on Neha Dhupia's podcast, #NoFilterNeha, and said that he has found the one.Varun said, "I have never hidden it from anyone that I have been in a relationship. I have just never spoken about it openly." He talked about how being a public figure, speculation about his relationship has always made headlines. The Badrinath Ki Dulhania actor said, "She is not from the film line, so as much as I can, I protect her from the media frenzy."When Neha asked Varun if there would be wedding bells in the near future, he said, "Honestly, we have not thought that much ahead. Sometimes in life, when you find someone and that connection is formed, then everything else that you thought was the be-all and end-all of life, doesn't actually matter."On the work front, Varun will be seen next in his father David Dhawan's Judwaa 2 in a double role.
