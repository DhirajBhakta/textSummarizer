Delhi cop masturbates at woman constable in training academy.
A Delhi police cop has been suspended for getting drunk and flashing in front of a woman colleague at the police training college. The incident was reported by the woman officer who informed her seniors on Saturday night. Police sources said the cop, posted at the police training college in Jharoda Kalan, had also inappropriately touched two women constables at dinner. At around 6pm, inside the mess, the cop who was reportedly reeking of alcohol touched two women constables. They threatened to inform their superiors if he did not apologise. An hour later, another woman constable alleged that the cop had stripped and masturbated in front of her. The woman informed the police after which senior officials reached the spot. Investigation revealed that after being warned by the two women in the mess, the policeman returned to his room and drank more liquor. Later, he went to his terrace and stripped. Senior officers who reached the spot held an informal test identification parade during which the complainant identified the man. A senior police officer confirmed the news and said they are conducting a departmental inquiry.
