Aussie players sledged me during warm-up game: Shreyas Iyer.
Attacking young batsman from Mumbai, Shreyas Iyer, said he was sledged by wicketkeeper Matthew Wade and David Warner during the course of the day two of the ongoing three-day practice match between India A and Australia.Iyer slammed an unbeaten 85 off 93 balls against Australia to power India A to 176/4 in reply to the visitors' 469/7 declared.Iyer revealed that he was sledged by Wade and vice captain Warner when he was going great guns but it did not affect him as he was used to it following tours to Australia with the India A team in the past."They started to sledge and said 'this guy does not have defense, he can play only attacking shots'. It was first Wade and then Warner too joined in. But I am used to this type of sledging, having toured Australia with India A teams in the past," Iyer said.Iyer also said he was confident that one day he will definitely get to play for India."I don't think much on that, I try to play and score as many runs as possible. The side is packed at present, but I know I will get a chance definitely to play for the country," said the 22-year-old. Iyer has had a phenomenal run at the domestic level in his first two seasons before his form took a slight dip in the current season. Today, Iyer started in brilliant fashion by hitting Australia's leading off-spinner Nathan Lyon for a first-ball six over long on.Later Iyer often stepped out to Lyon and left-arm spinner Stephen O'Keefe to hit them for a total of five sixes over long-on in an impressive display of attacking batting and was the biggest contributor to India A's first innings score.Iyer said the lofted shots he played against Lyon and O'Keefe were not predetermined."I am happy they were not predetermined shots. It was important to take charge early on and spread out the field. It worked out well," Iyer said.
