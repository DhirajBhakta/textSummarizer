I've been a possessive girlfriend in the past: Shraddha.
She might play a half-girlfriend in Mohit Suri's upcoming film, but in real life Shraddha Kapoor claims to be single. Despite being in the news for her rumoured relationship with Rock On 2 actor Farhan Akhtar, the 30-year-old actor says that she is happy focussing on her work. In an interview to Filmfare, Shraddha said, "I'm happy being single and focussing on my work. Agar boyfriend hota toh main distract ho jaati. Right now I don't feel it's necessary.""Yes, sometimes it's difficult to give time to a relationship. But I don't believe it's impossible. If you want to have a relationship, you will manage to balance it with work," she added. Shraddha might not be looking for a boyfriend right now, but she believes that love can happen any time. "Earlier, I was like, my man should have a good sense of humour, a sense of adventure. But now I realise that love can happen with anyone, any time, anywhere. And when it happens, I won't be checking for those qualities in him. Because when you connect with someone, that's all that matters."When asked if she has been a possessive girlfriend, Shraddha said, "Yes, I have been one. But I don't want to be a possessive girlfriend anymore. I want to give space to that person. Allow them to do what they want."Shraddha's love life has made headlines in the recent past and the actor revealed the rumours of her dating Farhan have affected her in a certain way, but now she has learnt to ignore them. "What I can't control, I ignore. Because there's no truth in it. And my focus is films. I don't focus on rubbish stories that people write about me. As actors we work hard to deliver a good performance. Reporters should be responsible when they write about us. Link-up rumours are not fair. It affects my family also. But now I have learnt to ignore it," she added. On the work front, she will be seen romancing Arjun Kapoor in Half Girlfriend.
