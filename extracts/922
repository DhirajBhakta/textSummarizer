Rail officials propose installing CCTVs at Mumbai stations.
As part of the Centre?s cleanliness campaign Swachh Bharat Abhiyan on the suburban railway stations, the Central and the Western railway authorities are looking to monitor cleanliness through Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) cameras. However, for this purpose, they would need an additional 2,800 cameras on both the suburban railway sections.A proposal has been prepared by WR and CR officials which has been sent to the ministry of railways for approval. The proposal includes setting up the network of CCTV cameras in the station premises to monitor cleanliness at each station. TV screens are proposed to be put up inside station master?s cabins for the same. As of now, pilot projects have been undertaken at Churchgate and Mumbai Central stations, said the officials. Earlier, the ministry of railways had issued instructions to the Zonal Railways to extend the use of the CCTV?s apart from surveillance by the Railway Protection Force (RPF). During the meeting the ministry had asked the officers to try to implement the use of the cameras for monitoring cleanliness. The plan was prepared accordingly.
