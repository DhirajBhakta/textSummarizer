Govt allows people to apply online for passports in Hindi.
By Ashwini Shrivastava New Delhi, Apr 23 (PTI) The Ministry of External Affairs has made a provision enabling people to apply online for passports in Hindi. The move comes after President Pranab Mukherjee recently accepted recommendations made in this regard by the Committee of Parliament on Official Language via its ninth report. The report was submitted in 2011. The panel had suggested that bilingual forms should be made available by all passport offices and forms filled in Hindi should also be accepted. It had recommended that entries should also be made in Hindi in all passports being issued. These recommendations have been accepted by the president recently, as per an official order. People can download the application form available in Hindi, fill it in and upload it while applying for the passport. The printout of filled-in form will not be accepted by Passport Seva Kendra and Regional Passport Offices. The panel on the official language had also recommended that information regarding passport and visa should be made available in Hindi on the official website of the ministry. "This recommendation is accepted," the order said.
