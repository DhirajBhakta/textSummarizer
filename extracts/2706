Bengaluru hotel denies room to Hindu-Muslim couple.
A hotel in Bengaluru turned away a Hindu-Muslim couple and refused to give them a room as the husband was a Muslim and his wife a Hindu.Shafeeq Subaida Hakkim and Divya DV, a couple from Kerala, were in Bengaluru for some official work. They needed an accommodation to stay but  refused a room at Olive Residency on Annipuram Main Road in Sudhama Nagar.  The receptionist at the hotel said that a Hindu and Muslim cannot live together. The receptionist went on to make his point saying that he has instructions not to give rooms to Hindu-Muslim couples as there may be problems.Shafeeq said that they were shocked by the behaviour as they have never faced such a situation before. "I wanted the room for just 2 hours since my wife Divya had come here for an interview with a prestigious law college. Divya is an LLM graduate and was looking to do her PhD here,"  Shafeeq told India Today. He said the hotel explicitly told them it's their policy not to allow inter-religion married couples. When Divya asked him to show the hotel policy in print, the management flatly refused. Shafeeq and his wife then got into another hotel and she managed to attend her interview. He now plans to file a complaint with the Kerala Human Rights Commission.ALSO READ:
