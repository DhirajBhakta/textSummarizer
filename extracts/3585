Sachin should aid in cricket administration: BCCI panel head.
After the embarrassing loss of vote and face for Board of Cricket Control for India (BCCI) at the International Cricket Council (ICC) and left to deal with defiant office bearers, the head of BCCI Committee of Administrators (CAO) Vinod Rai urged legends of Indian cricket to speak up to ensure cricket administration improves. Rai was speaking at the launch of a biographical book of cricket icon Sachin Tendulkar. Closing his speech Rai addressing Tendulkar said, "I think Indian cricket is once again at its peak, you would agree. We have a remarkable young team. They are aggressive, they are dedicated. Their commitment on the field is wonderful. We go to see these matches because cricketers perform remarkably on the ground. We need to ask ourselves if we are providing them with the right support in terms of logistics, administration. All that you must be reading in the newspapers is unfortunate and I don't think we are doing good service to the excellent team we have." He went on to urge the former greats of Indian cricket to take a stand over administrative matters using their position of influence to clean the system. "I would suggest that because of the fact that they deserve something far better, legends like Kapil (Dev), Sourav (Ganguly), Anil Kumble, Rahul Dravid, Sunil Gavaskar and Sachin Tendulkar need to in some ways mentor these people and also speak up and ensure that cricket administration in this country improves.
