Jet Airways pilot body meets over 'obscene' WhatsApp scandal.
Mumbai, Jun 6 (PTI) Jet Airways domestic pilots body NAG will convene a meeting tomorrow to chart out an "action plan" following the questioning of some of its members by the Delhi Police over alleged posting of obscene messages on a WhatsApp group. The National Aviators Guild (NAG), which claims representation of around 1,000 of the Jet Airways 1,500 pilots, would also coordinate with the two pilot unions of government-run Air India -- ICPA and IPG -- over the issue, a Guild member said today. Sources at the Guild said the emergency meeting would be held at Chennai tomorrow to chalk out its action plan following todays development. "This is unprecedented as our members (pilots) were called by the DGCA for a meeting for some other issue and they had no idea that this was for some thing," the Guild member said. In a rare move, aviation watchdog DGCA has filed a police complaint against 34 pilots of Jet Airways, IndiGo, SpiceJet and GoAir for allegedly posting "obscene" messages on a WhatsApp group against its officials. Acting on the complaint, Delhi Police today questioned 13 pilots, including those of Jet Airways. The member also said the pilots were questioned by the police even without any "preliminary inquiry" into the alleged complaint or a prior information to them about the complaint. The Guild has taken up the issue with the airline management and it is waiting for its "response" as well, he added.
