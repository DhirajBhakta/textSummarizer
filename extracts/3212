Kapil takes a dig at flight brawl with Sunil on his show.
Recently Ali Asgar was seen teasing Sunil Grover about the plane incident on Sony TV's Sabe Bada Kalakar. Now it's Kapil Sharma himself taking a jab at the incident.   In a recent promo of The Kapil Sharma Show, the TKSS team is in a plane setup. Everyone's seen fighting, when Kiku Sharda dressed as an air hostess asks Chappu aka Kapil Sharma to intervene. To which he says, "Main flight mein nahi bolta aajkal."
