I'm disappointed: Kabir Khan on Tubelight's performance.
Kabir Khan and Salman Khan duo gave the year 2015 its most successful Bollywood movie-- Bajrangi Bhaijaan. This year, audience was expecting a similar kind of collaboration between the two, when their film, Tubelight, arrived in cinema halls on June 25.But it all turned out exactly the opposite. The film failed to impress the critics and the audience, so much so that some of them even dubbed it as Salmans worst film.I am disappointed, Kabir says in an interview with PTI.    Bhaigiri!  #4DaysToTubelight @SohailKhanofficial @kabirkhankk @man_on_ledge @TubelightKiEid A post shared by Salman Khan (@beingsalmankhan) on Jun 18, 2017 at 10:30pm PDTYou make a film with a lot of love and conviction and if it doesnt do well the way it was expected to do, its disheartening.The filmmaker, however, says Tubelight will always remain special irrespective of what response it received at the box office.

Every film of mine is put against Bajrangi Bhaijaan and it is unfair. I am extremely proud of Tubelight.Its too early to analyse what went wrong with the film. Maybe people were not able to identify with the character of Salman. But I was happy with what Salman did and even he was playing this part.    Zhu Zhu, what a beautiful Lady!! #Tubelight #MainAgar @kabirkhankk @man_on_ledge  @TubelightKiEid @sonymusicindia A post shared by Salman Khan (@beingsalmankhan) on Jun 14, 2017 at 10:30pm PDTRecently, it was reported that Salman would refund distributors to compensate for the losses incurred by Tubelight.When asked about it, Kabir says, I am not a producer, I am a line producer of the film. I cant talk about it as its about business. I think it is a great thing. Its a good gesture by Salman. (But) For the film itself the cost is successful.Follow @htshowbiz for more
