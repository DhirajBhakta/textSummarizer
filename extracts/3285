WhatsApp launches feature to pin chats at the top on Android.
WhatsApp is making it easier for people to keep their most important messages in sight. The instant messaging app on Thursday rolled out the Pinned Chats feature for Android allowing users to pin their three most  important message conversations on top of all the other chats. " With pinned chats, you never have to worry about scrolling through the long list of conversations to text your family members or your best friend. Users can now pin up to three of the most important group or individual chats to the top of their chat list for easy access -- simply tap and hold a chat, and then tap the pin icon at the top of your screen, " WhatsApp said in a press release.Also Read:  WhatsApp Pin Chats feature to help you keep important chats in sightThe Pinned chats was previously available in beta phase and is now available as an update.
