K'taka Min caught on camera ordering cop to book RSS leader.
The Karnataka Assembly came under fire over a video in which the state's Forest Minister Ramanath Rai is seen ordering the Dakshina Kannada Superintendent of Police (SP) Bhushan Gulabrao Borase to arrest Kalladka Prabhakar Bhat of the RSS. Raising the issue in the Assembly, Former chief minister of Karnataka Jagdish Shettar alleged 'Rai has interfered in political investigation and has no moral rift to continue as a minister. He should be asked to resign.'In his defence, Rai denied having issued specific instructions on Bhat's arrest. Rai claimed that members of the sangh parivar were allegedly involved in the murder of a gram panchayat member and his move was to ask the police to arrest the man in question."There has always been a pattern whenever communal violence has broken out in Dakshina Kannada especially in Kalladka. The pattern is such that the conspirators and the men who defend the accused are the same. There is evidence that sangh parivar members were involved in the murder of a panchayat vice-president. Provocative speeches made by Bhat often lead to communal violence in the region. I only asked the SP to book cases against the instigators," added Rai. The opposition in Karnataka alleged that Ramanath Rai instigated the police officer. The BJP leaders alleged the same adding that Rai's aim was to target Hindi organisations in the coastal region. Referring to the communal violence in Kalladka, the opposition feared that such allegations could further fuel the situation.As the issue rocked the Assembly, the speaker intervened and assured that the state home minister will take stock of the situation.However, the Vishwa Hindi Parishad and the Bajrang Dal took out protests demanding the resignation of Rai. Nearly 18 Hindu organisations were seen participating in the protest which took place in Mangaluru. The protesters were arrested but later released.
