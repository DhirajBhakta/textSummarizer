Best b'day gift was when my dad gifted me my first car: Huma.
Actor Huma Qureshi has had quite a busy year so far. It began with the Akshay Kumar-starrer Jolly LLB 2, which did well at the box-office. After this, she got busy promoting her debut Hollywood film at international film festivals in London. Currently, the actor is looking forward to the release of the film in India. On her birthday today, asked if there are any special plans in store, she says, ?Well, since I am busy shooting here and there, and I have been really busy travelling too, so it will be a very low key affair this year, with just family [in Mumbai only].?Besides promoting her international project across India, Huma is also busy with the shooting of her Tamil film Kaala Karikalan (in Chennai) where she?s paired opposite superstar Rajinikanth.While all birthdays have been special for Huma, she shares that the most cherished was the one when her brother, actor Saqib Saleem did something special for her in their childhood days. ?Saqib gave me a handmade card, where he had pasted a picture of the whole family together and wished me happy birthday. For me, it was the cutest thing ever,? recalls Huma, adding, ?I?m always up for surprises.?
