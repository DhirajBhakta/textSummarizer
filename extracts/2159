Delhi govt schools to hire retired teachers.
Retired school teachers will now be appointed in Delhi government-run schools in case of shortage of teachers or temporary vacancies.Deputy chief minister and education minister Manish Sisodia on Tuesday said school principals can appoint retired teachers without getting prior approval from the education department.?If there is shortage of teachers in any school, then the principal need not ask the deputy director or send the file to him. Now, the principals will be able to appoint retired teachers of government schools for such vacancies,? Sisodia said.He said the decision has been taken to ensure children do not suffer due to lack of teachers or in case existing teachers go on leave or training.Sisodia announced the decision during the annual function of a Sarvodaya Vidyalaya in Mayur Vihar Phase I.?It is often difficult to permit teachers to go on leave due to shortage of teaching staff. Appointment of retired teachers as per need will solve this problem,? Sisodia said.Retired TGT and PGT teachers of government schools will have to register themselves on the education department?s website if they want to apply for these posts.?They can select a school of their choice,? officials said.The government also plans to hire visiting teachers to meet the shortage.The policy being worked out by the government will allow principals to hire subject teachers for a period of three months. ?I will give principals the power to hire teachers for a fixed period.These teachers will act as substitutes for those on leave. But, we have named them visiting teachers,? deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia told HT.
