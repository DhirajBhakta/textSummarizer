SRCC student slaps professor after scoring low marks.
Reacting to low marks assigned to him, a student from Shri Ram College of Commerce (SRCC) slapped and physically assaulted his professor on Friday evening, sending a wave of shock across the college faculty. Ashwani Kumar, an assistant professor at SRCC's global business operations in Delhi University, was attacked by his student of management discipline who resorted to kicking the professor's car and slapping him multiple times over being awarded low marks in his internal examination. The professor has left the city and gone to Haryana following the incident. "The student - who fought with Ashwani and slapped him - holds a record of irregularity in academics. The incident took place in the parking area and in the presence of the college principal R P Rustagi," said professor Alok Kumar, calling it a heinous crime. ASSAULT ON PROFESSORS NOT NEW FOR SRCC"How will we inculcate discipline on the college premises if teachers are attacked for nothing but performing their duty?" wondered Alok, who is an assistant professor in the commerce department. SRCC's officiating principal and professor Ashwani Kumar did not answer to Mail Today's calls.
