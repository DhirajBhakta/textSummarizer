Ex-Australian PM sends signed bat to Modi through Indian man.
These days if you just happen to wait outside the Parliament, there is a fair chance of meeting an immaculately dressed young Sikh gentleman walking around with a framed bat. His ultimate mission is to reach the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) and give the bat to Prime Minister Narendra Modi "personally." However, stopped by Kalashnikov-toting soldiers in the country's most secured zone, the closest point he has been able to get to in South Block remains Vijay Chowk.   Indeed, as the security guys too found out, the bat Manpreet Singh "from Sydney" is carrying is rather special. It has been sent by Tony Abbott, the former Prime Minister of Australia. Yes, the same man who took Modi on a tour of the Melbourne Cricket Ground in 2014.  Abbott is no longer the Australian Prime Minister but the friendship between the two leaders - they famously addressed each other by their first names in 2014 - remains intact. So, the latest 'to-Narendra-from-Tony' gift is a special MS Dhoni series bat with a hand-written message through 'messenger' Manpreet."I was the brand ambassador for 'Festival of India in Australia' event when the Indian PM visited Australia. I have know the Australian PM for long and, because cricket is loved equally in both the countries, he sent this bat as a gift for Mr. Modi through me," Manpreet told India Today. Abbott writes on the bat: "To Narendra, it was an honour to work closely with you to strengthen the historic ties between our countries. I will always cherish our friendship." Singh, who works as a mall manager, is actively involved in NRI events down under. These days, he and his cousin travel from Faridabad to Delhi with a hope of finding a way to meet Modi.
