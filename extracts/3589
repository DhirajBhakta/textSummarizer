Australian players reject Cricket Australia's new pay offer.
Australia's professional cricketers rejected a pay offer from the sport's governing body on Friday, saying the proposal was "a win for cricket administrators but a loss for cricket".The already protracted and sometimes rancorous negotiations between the players' union and Cricket Australia (CA) precede the expiry of the current five-year deal, which runs out at the end of June.CA released their proposal last month, offering large salary increases, particularly for women, but breaking with the 20-year model of a fixed percentage of revenue from the game going to the cricketers.That break and a number of other factors proved unacceptable to the Australian Cricketers Association (ACA), who laid out a counter-proposal in a statement on Friday."The ACA on behalf of Australia's cricketers has today rejected Cricket Australia's pay and conditions proposal," read a statement."The ACA also expresses frustration that what should be a relatively simple and good faith negotiation has not proceeded in this way."The fact that CA has, despite various attempts to do so, produced no logical reason to break the successful partnership model and longstanding relationship with players, leaves the players unclear as to CA's objectives."
