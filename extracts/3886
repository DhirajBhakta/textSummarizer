Naam Shabana banned a day after its release in Pakistan.
By now, we all know that Aamir Khan's Dangal will not have a Pakistan release due to their censor board's objection to scenes featuring the national flag and national anthem. Now, Taapsee Pannu and Akshay Kumar's spy thriller Naam Shabana has been stopped from playing in theatres, if a report in DNA is to be believed.Apparently, the film was released smoothly, but officials put a stop to the screening after realising that the film contains references to terrorism. Pakistan has long been accused of state-sponsored terrorism, but authorities have always denied any involvement in the same.A source close to the development was quoted as saying, "The Pakistani authorities seemed fine with the film. But a day after the film released they woke up to the fact that the theme of terrorism could reflect badly on Pakistan."Naam Shabana revolves around Shabana Khan (Taapsee) and her journey of becoming a secret agent. She is trained to eliminate any threats to the national security of the country and is involved in a mission to eliminate the largest arms supplier to terrorist groups, played by Prithviraj Sukumaran.
