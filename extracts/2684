Bengaluru witnesses its first lesbian marriage.
At a time when the Indian society has just begun to come to terms with  homosexuality, case of an alleged lesbian wedding in Bengaluru has become a point of discussion .It is believed that a 25-year-old woman married another 21-year-old woman at a temple in Koramangala.The parents of one of the girls had filed a missing complaint only to later find out that their daughter was not only in a lesbian relationship , she had also married another woman at a temple in the city.The 21-year-old girl is allegedly now being counselled by the Vanita Sahaya Vani, the women's grievance cell of the police. The marriage is not legal after Supreme Court decriminalised section 377 in 2013.The story of the two women is just like any other love story. The older lady was fascinated by the younger one and have been together as they are distant relatives.The older lady said that she was so in love with her wife that she used to take her shopping and buy her expensive gifts.At one point of time, the older lady expressed her love only to meet with rejection. The older woman pursued and convinced the younger one to marry her. Today, they claim to be a 'couple madly in love' with each other.  COUPLE TRACED TO KORMANGALA APARTMENT Based on the missing complaint filed by the younger woman's family, the police initiated a search operation and traced them to an apartment in Koramangala.The couple tried to seek help of an NGO to fight their case and also to let their family and police know that they are happy together and as adults have taken their own decisions.As of now , the police is perplexed as to how to pursue this case, while the 'wife' is undergoing counseling.While many feel that the whole idea of criminalising homosexuality was to bring sanity in society, but legal experts feel that the SC order was clear that one cannot be booked for being lesbian or gay. It needs to be taken on a case by case situation.But to legally take action or even arrest, one of them needs to file a complaint or else it will not stand strong in the court.Also Read:
