New Delhi, Jun 18 (PTI) Ex-gratia compensation for paramilitary personnel, injured in action leading to 100 per cent disability, has been increased from Rs 9 lakh to Rs 20 lakh. The enhanced compensation will be applicable to all central paramilitary personnel whose disability is attributed to or aggravated in service on or after January 1, 2016, the home ministry said in an office memorandum recently. "It has been decided to revise rate of ex-gratia lump sum compensation from Rs 9 lakh to Rs 20 lakh with effect from January 1, 2016 for 100 per cent disability to CAPF and Assam Rifles on the basis of recommendations of the 7th Pay Commission," it stated. For cases with less than 100 per cent disability, the amount of ex-gratia compensation may be reduced in proportion to the degree of disability. About 10 lakh personnel in eight forces come under the home ministry.
