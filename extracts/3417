Ranbir's pics as Sanjay Dutt shouldn't have come out: Hirani.
Ranbir Kapoor's pictures from the sets of Dutt biopic leaked online a few weeks ago, and the actor has been lauded for getting the perfect look. In fact, in most of the pictures, the Barfi! actor looks like a spitting image of Sanjay Dutt. However, director Rajkumar Hirani is unhappy that Ranbir's look got leaked. However, he is happy with the way the biopic is shaping up. "The pictures shouldn't have come out. We were shooting in Carter road (in Bandra, a suburb in Mumbai) so it came out. But I am very happy. The film is being made with a lot of happiness and when a film is made with happiness, it turns out good. Its a great story," he told PTI. If reports are to be believed, Ranbir will be seen sporting six, totally different looks in Dutt that will highlight different phases in Sanjay Dutt's life.Tentatively titled Dutt, the film will focus on Sanjay's formative years, his relation with his father Sunil Dutt, his struggles coping up with the loss of his mother, his many affairs, etc.  Hirani says that they have already shot 60 per cent of the film. However, they are yet to lock a title for the film.  ALSO READ: Ranbir Kapoor to sport six different looks for Sanjay Dutt biopic  ALSO READ: 10 events from Sanjay Dutt's life that should be in his biopic
