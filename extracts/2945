Nobody is anyone's father or son: Latif after Ind-Pak final.
Rashid Latif has extended a hand of friendship towards Virender Sehwag after his tirade on social media created a storm in India. In the course of the Champions Trophy, Latif had used derogatory language over Sehwag's witty remarks on social media. The former Pakistan wicketkeeper's choice of vocabulary had left much to be desired and his verbal onslaught left observers stunned. While Sehwag had chosen to maintain a dignified silence, India cricketer Manoj Tiwary posted a video with a like-for-like response to Latif. India had defeated Pakistan in their Champions Trophy opener on June 4 and there was the usual social media banter between supporters of the two teams. Sometimes the banter tends to get a little overboard as emotions run high. However, Pakistan came back strongly from their dismal start to first storm into the final and then defeating India, the pre-tournament favourites. "We lost one match badly in this year's Champions Trophy to India and India lost the final badly to Pakistan...this is a part of cricket and it happens," said Latif in a fresh video after Pakistan's remarkable vicotry.
