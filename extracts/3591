ICC willing to increase India's revenue share to 2,500 cr.
The International Cricket Council's USD 390 million offer to the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) still stands, ICC chairman Shashank Manohar has told India Today. Manohar said ICC recognises India's contribution but insisted that distribution has to be based on equity and good governance."ICC is still agreeable to increase BCCI's share to USD 390 million of the total net revenue of USD 1800 million. It is 21.5 percent of the net revenue," Manohar told India Today.WATCH VIDEO HERE"England which gets the second largest share is 7.5 percent. India will get Rs 1500 crores more than England. We recognise India's contribution but distribution has to be based on equity and good governance. ICC is aware and conscious of how much money is required to run the game."Manohar said no revenue model which said India were to get USD 570 million was ever discussed. He termed this hypothetical talk."To say India was to get USD 570 million is not true. Such a model was never ever implemented. It was supposed to be implemented from 2016 but many boards had objections and a working group was constituted. "It is all hypothetical talk which has no basis in fact," Manohar said. BCCI representatives had tried to play the Champions Trophy card at the ICC meeting. India badly rebuffed. Members told India, if you use a gun, we will use other firearms. According to the earlier cycle, every board got 62 million.
