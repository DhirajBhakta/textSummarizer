Stop inciting people against me: Robert Vadra to Kejriwal.
Robert Vadra, son-in-law of Congress president Sonia Gandhi, has slammed Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal for consistently targeting him. Vadra, in a Facebook post, asked Kejriwal to speak to him directly instead of making baseless charges."Robert Vadra seems to be the most referred name in the dictionary of Delhi CM. His remarks "Vadra will eat him alive" depict a strange obsession for me. I would humbly request our Delhi CM to come and speak with me directly, for all his grudges he has against me, instead of inciting other people against me. My best wishes to our Delhi CM, in all his endeavours," Vadra wrote. The businessman was referring to Kejriwal's statement in the Delhi Assembly a couple of days ago."You can only arrest Satyendar Jain, not (Sheila) Dikshit. If the PM raises a finger against Robert Vadra, I'll be convinced he has a 56-inch chest...Vadra will eat him alive...He (Modi) is taking revenge on the people of Delhi for choosing us, and has been blocking our work, but we have done so much despite the hindrance," Kejriwal had said while delivering his vote of thanks speech to the Lieutenant Governor's address in the Assembly. WHY KEJRIWAL HAS BEEN TARGETING VADRAIn 2012, Kejriwal had accused Vadra of being involved in a big land scam. He alleged that Vadra had purchased property worth crores of rupees on unsecured loans given by realty major DLF as quid pro quo for favours allegedly done to the company by Congress governments in Delhi, Rajasthan and Haryana.Kejriwal had alleged that property worth Rs 300 crore was given at throwaway prices by DLF to companies owned by Vadra with an unsecured interest free loan of Rs 65 crore from given by the realty firm.Both Vadra and DLF had then rubbished the charges.Watch the video here ALSO READ:
