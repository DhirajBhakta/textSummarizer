MNS workers attack Zara outlet for selling Pakistani clothes.
After staying out of headlines for a long a time, Raj Thackeray's party did what it knows best. Citing Pakistan's decision to sentence Kulbhushan Jadhav to death, Thackeray's Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) workers on Tuesday stormed into fashion brand Zara's showroom in Lower Parel and threw away clothes bearing Made in Pakistan tags. The party says this is their way to protest against the decision of a Pakistani court to sentence Indian citizen Kulbhushan Jadhav to death."We had written letters to them asking them not to sell Pakistani brands. Other stores in areas like Juhu had acceded to our request. But, we got information that the lower Parel store still sells Pakistani clothes. Hence, we had to protest," said Rita Gupta , MNS's general Secretary, adding "We have information about a few more stores in Mumbai who sell Pakistani goods. In next few days, we will target more such stores selling Pakistani goods." After the Uri attacks, MNS had threatened Pakistani artists and even went on to stop the release of Karan Johar's Ae Dil Hai Mushkil that starred Pakistani artist Fawad Khan. But, this time the MNS's move to mix up patriotism with hooliganism hasn't gone down well with many.BJP leader and fashion designer Shaina NC called this protest as a desperate move to grab headlines."Some parties are trying to use the sentiments to revive their fortunes. But, whatever they have done at the Zara store is nothing, but hooliganism. No one has the right to take law into their hands," Shaina said. "Our govt stand in solidarity with Kulbhushan Jadhav, but then there is a legal and democratic way to protest. The police will soon file a case and the culprits will be brought to book," Shaina said.Also read:Hope for Kulbhushan Jadhav: India to ask for defence lawyer in Pakistan
