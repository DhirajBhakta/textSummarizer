Don't know why I was against joining social media: Katrina.
After staying away from social media for so many years, Katrina Kaif gave into the temptation only a few months ago. She took her fans by surprise when she made her debut on Facebook, and later added another address - Instagram. Since then her fans cannot get enough of her gorgeous pictures. From film sets to her hot photoshoots to her mood swings, Katrina is giving a sneak-peek into her life, and we are not complaining. In an exclusive interview to India Today Television, the 33-year-old actor talked about her fear of not joining social media for so long. She said, "I don't know why I was so against joining the social media. My mind was blocked completely, I wasn't even ready for a discussion. But now that I have come on it, I really like it. I really enjoy it."However, the Dhoom 3 actor added that she should have joined social media a long time ago. "I really wish I had because I would have done much more. I would have had that much time to grow my base of people who interact with me. But so far, it has been fun for me. I have things to say, and then there are these abstract pictures and thoughts in my head. And I want to have an audience to share them with. It makes me feel not so alone," said Katrina. On the work front, she has three films in hand after Jagga Jasoos and that too starring all the three Khans. If Aanand L Rai's next has Shah Rukh, Thugs of Hindostan will see Aamir Khan and Tiger Zinda Hai will see Salman in the lead. Katrina feels happy to have good projects in her hand. "These moves are not thought out by me. After Jagga Jasoos, I had no film, and then everything kind of happened on its own," she added.
