Attack on Muslim by gau rakshaks did not take place: Naqvi.
Union minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, responding to the Alwar gau rakshak attack, said that no such incident, as was reported by the media, took place. Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi's statement came as the Opposition raised the issue of Alwar lynching in the House. Congress leader Madhusudan Mistry said law and order has collapsed in Rajasthan. Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi then spoke on the issue and said, "It is a very sensitive issue. From this, there should be no indication or message that we are supporting such incidents". The minister then went on to say that "the kind of incident that is being talked about never took place on ground".
