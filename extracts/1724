J&K discourse shifting to primacy of Islam over Azadi: Army.
Hyderabad, Jan 5 (PTI) A top Indian Army official today said the "discourse" in Jammu and Kashmir is shifting to "primacy of Islam over Azadi" adding to complexities in dealing with sectarian faultlines in the border state. "...Jammu and Kashmir indeed continues to be a challenge and its being dealt with; its getting a little more complex as slowly the discourse, as indeed the entire thrust, is taking a shift towards a primacy of Islam over Azadi. So, that clearly adds a fairly complex dynamic to stabilising the nation as it were," Deputy Chief of Army Staff (Planning & Systems), Lieutenant General Subrata Saha, said.
