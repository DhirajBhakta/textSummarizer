Punjab female police officer marries her same-sex partner.
India's criminalisation of homosexuality did not stop a Punjab police sub-inspector from marrying a woman and that too with full Punjabi style. Manjit Kaur, a sub-inspector in the Punjab Police, tied a knot with a woman and it wasn't a hush-hush affair. Jalandhar's Pucca Bagh witnessed a big fat same-sex wedding.While the cop wore a red turban, her bride rode a chariot. The marriage was solemnised according to the Hindu rituals, as reported by The Tribune. Reportedly, the wedding took place in the presence of their families, many classmates and colleagues of Manjit too were present at the ceremony.This is not the first time that a same-sex couple has gotten married. In fact, India has its very own gay marriage bureau.  Benhur Samson, an NRI, established India's first avenue where gays can find their soulmates in 2016. The bureau helps them find the right match, both within and outside the country. Samson started the arranged gay marriage service when he received numerous requests from gays regarding prospective life partners. Till 2013, he used to help gays with surrogacy. According to figures submitted by the government to the Supreme Court in 2012, there are 25 lakh gay people in India. Perhaps, it is time the Supreme Court goes ahead and takes a progressive step and decriminalises homosexuality. Also read:
