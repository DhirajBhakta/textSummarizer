Saif is a pro, he even changes son Taimur's diapers: Kareena.
Kareena Kapoor Khan showed no signs of slowing down due to her pregnancy and having a baby. Bebo, who walked the ramp at the Lakme Fashion Week finale on Sunday, said that it was no "big deal" to return to the ramp so soon after her delivery. "It's just been day 46 (post delivery) and it feels great. The idea is to do what I have been always loved to do, which is work," she told IANS.ALSO READ: Sara and Ibrahim cannot get enough of li'l TaimurPHOTOS: These new photos of Saif-Kareena with Taimur are too cute to missBut while Kareena's friends like Manish Malhotra cheered her on, her husband Saif Ali Khan was missing from the show. Kareena explained, "Because right now, he is looking after Taimur. We share the responsibility. We are the real-life Ki and Ka. He's very supportive. When he's working, I'm at home and when I'm working, he's at home. That's the way I think every man and woman should be.""Saif and I are like Ki and Ka. We share the responsibilities. He is very supportive" - Kareena pic.twitter.com/uUEeIL7yBXKareena told Indian Express that Saif is a very hands-on father. She said, "He is so hands-on because he has done it before but I feel there is an intensity with which his son looks at him, more than when he looks at me. So, there is already a bond between them. Also, Saif is a pro, he does everything, including changing the diapers."daily reminder that kareena kapoor khan is literally perfect, amazing and just an ethereal goddess ð @lakmefashionwk @anitadongre - semih kareenafc #kareenakapoorkhan #kareenakapoor #bollywoodstyleA video posted by NehAli Bhatti (@nehali_queen) on Feb 5, 2017 at 7:34pm PST
