It's girl love homage: Priyanka on Katrina line in Baywatch.
Priyanka Chopra made a fleeting visit to India to read a few scripts, finalise her next Bollywood film, catch up with her friends and most importantly, to promote her big ticket Hollywood debut, Baywatch. Starring Dwayne Johnson, Zac Efron and a bevy of beauties, Baywatch has Priyanka Chopra playing the baddie, Victoria Leeds, and she has slayed it as the bad boss lady!Priyanka uneviled the trailer of the Hindi-dubbed version of Baywatch (directed by Seth Gorden) in Mumbai during her visit. Dubbed by Priyanka herself, the trailer went viral almost instantaneously for its absurd and ridiculously funny dialgoues. You cannot miss the one where she flicks Zac Efron off by saying "Chal na Katrina," a translation of "Easy, Britney."When it's in Hindi... it's actually even more fun! #ChalNaKatrina#GirlLove#BeBaywatch#VictoriaLeedshttps://t.co/e8jsXhLBbjIn an exclusive chat with India Today Television, Priyanka Chopra confessed, "When I saw it, I laughed for twenty minutes, it was so funny." On being asked why she chose Katrina to replace Britney in the dialogue, Pee Cee said "I couldn't think of anyone else. Britney is such a huge star. So I had to find a modern day icon. I think Katrina Kaif is a major icon for Hindi cinema and I really really like her."She added, "This was my idea and I thought that it would be a fun replacment, and Katrina was really cool about it. I texted her before the trailer came out and she was like 'yeah, of course.' So I think she obviously saw the humour in it. I am really glad it has become so popular, it's my girl love homage to Katrina."
