Jat community to vote against BJP in polls: Report.
As political temperature soars in Uttar Pradesh ahead of the Assembly Polls, the Jat bodies in Haryana and western UP have decided to resume their agitation for reservation from January 29. The Jat leaders blaming the respective governments for not fulfiling their demands have said they would vote against the BJP in the polls. They have also blamed the Manohar Lal Khattar government in Haryana for not fulfiling what it had promised during the agitation in February 2016.Several districts in western UP like Saharanpur, Shamli, Mujjafarnagar, Bullandshahar, Meerut, Bagpat etc, have a large population of Jats and polarisation of these votes will be crucial for the election results. Polling in these districts is scheduled in first and second phase.BJP is already feeling the heat over demonetisation and if Jat community would go against the party, it will badly hit political equations for BJP. Hindu Jats and Muslims have significant numbers in these districts and they have the capability to turn election results in favour of particular party. SP, BSP and especially Ajit Singh's RLD are keeping close watch over the development in Haryana. Ajit Singh is a strong Jat leader from the region.The Jats of Haryana have also been garnering support from 250 Jat dominant villages of Delhi. The community leaders of Delhi organised a meeting at Nangloi's Sir Chotu Ram Dharamshala in which representatives of all 250 villages unanimously decided support the agitation for getting Other Backward Class (OBC) status.Also read | Jat reservation: SC quashes Centre's review plea"The BJP government in Haryana cheated us last time.
