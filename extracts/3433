Ex-SC lawyer alleges mother harassed by Jet Airways staff.
In a shocking case, a senior citizen's family has alleged that the woman was harrased by Jet Airways officials at Delhi's Indira Gandhi International Airport on May 3, causing her to have a blackout.A former advocate at the Supreme Court, Kawaljit Singh Bhatia, in a Facebook post the after he dropped his mother at the airport, he received a call saying that the officials didn't allow her to board as she was late. Here is what followed next:Jet Airways, however denied the charges and has now issued an official statement saying,"Jet Airways reaffirms its Guest First philosophy which is founded on principles of service excellence.The airline staff demonstrated the very same principles of concern while accepting the senior guest for boarding, despite the guest reporting late at the check-in counter.Subsequently, the guest proceeded for the boarding gate by herself, where she lost consciousness. She was then taken to the airport medical desk for first aid where investigations revealed her to be a diabetic with low haemoglobin.The above facts can be corroborated via CCTV footage available with the airport authorities, a copy of which has also been submitted to law enforcement authorities.Jet Airways strongly denies the allegations made in the social post which do not reflect the airline's service etiquette, standards and the exact nature of developments that transpired on the day."Also readThis airline is giving you 24 per cent off on flight bookings just for today
