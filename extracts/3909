Hindu community is in anger: VHP on Alwar cow vigilante case.
The ultra-right Hindutva outfit and Sangh affiliate Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) believes the Alwar killing, where a mob lynched a Muslim man over suspicions of him being a cow smuggler, was an expression of the popular and spontaneous anger of the Hindus and that it had nothing to do with any Hindutva outfit."We do not favour killing, but it needs to be understood that Hindus have long been mistreated in their own country and that such incidents are but an expression of the deep-seated anger among Hindus which bursts spontaneously. The politicians of the secular brigade are the ones who have fuelled this by teasing Hindus into a state where they might react," VHP leader Surendra Jain said."Asaduddin Owaisi stopped desecrating Hindu gods and goddesses when we told him in Hyderabad that we would be pushed to the wall and we could start the same for the Prophet," said VHPs international joint general secretary Surendra Jain. "Karnataka CM argued that he would continue to eat beef."HINDUS ARE ANGRY, SAYS JAINThe Hindu community is in anger, Jain said, and that it could express itself in spontaneous ways that we don't have control over. "These people forget that the 1857 freedom movement was sparked and based around the symbol of cow. Hindus will continue to be furious if their sentiments are hurt," he said."The Muslim community is entirely responsible for such incidents where the two communities clash over the cow. Muslims are Christians have desecrated Hindu gods and goddesses and have written such denigrating documents against Ram and Krishna and Kali to fill halls at end," Jain added.
