ISIS failed in India despite large Muslim population: Singh.
Saying that India has been successful in facing off against the challenges posed by the Islamic State, Home Minister Rajnath Singh said on Saturday, dubbing the global terror group a failure in the country. Addressing a press conference on the three years of the Narendra Modi government, Singh said the security situation in the country has largely been under control. Singh, who also spoke about the situation in Kashmir and the challenge of Naxalism, said the Islamic State (IS or ISIS) has failed to gain a foothold in India despite the country's large Muslim population."India is the second largest country as far as Muslim population in the world is concerned. I can say with full responsibility that despite such a large population (of Muslims), the ISIS has not been able to set foot," Rajnath Singh said.
