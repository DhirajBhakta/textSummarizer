85-kg calf jumps off building, falls on man in Kolkata.
There is a saying in Bengali which, roughly translated, means that someone who has had a wood apple fall on their head never goes to the orchards again. Going by that logic, this young man named Abdul Mannan will never again go near any cattle.On Sunday, 43-year-old Abdul Mannan was out and about in Kolkata's Tiljala area shopping for grocery. At one point, Mannan stooped over at a green grocer's stall to check out some cucumbers when calamity fell upon him.Only the calamity here was a calf. A living and breathing, 85-kg calf that fell out of the sky and on Mannan while he was shopping.Well, not 'out of the sky' per say. Reports have it that the calf was being kept tied up on the terrace of a four-storey building near the market were Mannan was shopping. Right at the moment when Mannan chose to stop under this building and shop, this six-month-old calf managed tear off the rope it was tied with and leap off the 70-foot high terrace.The next thing Mannan knew was that "something very heavy" had fallen on him. When he looked up, he found it was a cow lying on top of him. After that sight, the poor man fainted. Mannan later woke up in the Calcutta National Medical College with a fractured leg, several stitches and a head trauma. The calf, unfortunately, did not survive the crash-landing.Mannan, a peanut vendor and the sole breadwinner in his family, is still bedridden from the accident. The good news is that the owner of the calf is said to have paid for Mannan's medical expenses.Read more at FYI:
