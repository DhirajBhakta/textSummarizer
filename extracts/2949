SRK to have cameo in Ranbir, Katrina's Jagga Jasoos: Report.
There's some good news for fans who have been eagerly waiting for Ranbir Kapoor and Katrina Kaif's much-delayed film Jagga Jasoos to release. Apparently, Shah Rukh Khan has been roped in for a cameo in Anurag Basu's film.According to Bollywood Hungama, SRK was approached by the director earlier this year, and the actor came on board as he loved the character. Reportedly, he shot for his portions a few weeks ago in a Mumbai studio along with Ranbir, Katrina and other important characters. However, there has been no official confirmation from the Jagga Jasoos makers.Incidentally, it was Ranbir who came up with the title of Shah Rukh's next opposite Anushka Sharma - Jab Harry Met Sejal. Recently, SRK and Ranbir came together for Imtiaz Ali's birthday bash where the Raees actor gave him the promised cash reward of Rs 5000 for coming up with the film's title.Jagga Jasoos we r quits now!!! Hisaab barabar. Give @karanjohar his share for the â??Jabâ?? part in JHMS please.A post shared by Shah Rukh Khan (@iamsrk) on Jun 17, 2017 at 2:40am PDT
