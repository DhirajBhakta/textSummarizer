Kejriwal is a cunning, ambitious fraud like Modi: Katju.
Launching a scathing attack on Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, retired Supreme Court judge Markandey Katju called him a "cunning ambitious fraud" and compared him with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, calling both the leaders frauds. "Kejriwal is a cunning ambitious fraud with nothing in his head, and no different from that fraud Modi. Many people are still under illusions about him, but the time will come when their eyes will be opened to the truth," Katju tweeted on Thursday.Kejriwal is a cunning ambitious fraud with nothing in his head, and no different from that fraud Modi. Many people are still under illusionsThat was not all. Katju also logged on to Facebook to rant more on issues like the Triple Talaq debate and the use of burqa by Muslim women. "I support abolition of oral talaq and burqa, and enactment of a uniform civil code, as I believe that will benefit Muslims. But Kejriwal will never do that, as he fears he will lose Muslim votes if he does so. He will rush to Dadri and do such other drama to get support of Muslims. But I do not want Muslim votes. I will raise my voice against any atrocity on Muslims, but I will condemn the stupid, feudal and outdated customs and practices of many Muslims, just as I will condemn stupid, feudal and outdated practices of many Hindus, e.g. caste system and looking down on dalits," Katju posted on Facebook. This is not the first time Katju, with a reputation for shooting his mouth off, has attacked Kejriwal.
