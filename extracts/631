Delhi colleges may issue learners' licences to students soon.
Students in Delhi will get a chance to take a test and apply for a driving licence at their colleges, according to Delhis transport minister who spoke of a new system that is likely to be launched by September.According to a proposed plan, the government will empower educational institutions to issue learners licences. To be eligible, students will need to be above 18 and score at least 6 out of 10 marks in an online test that will be administered by the institutions. Transport minister Kailash Gahlot told Hindustan Times that the project, which will be reviewed by deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia this week, is being expedited because the demand for learners driving licence is highest among the 18-24 age group applicants.Currently, an applicant needs to visit any of the 13 motor licensing offices across the city to get a learners licence. Once implemented, it will be the first time that the government will authorise anyone apart from the MLOs to issue driving licences. More than 53% of those who took the learners licence last year were in the age bracket of 18-24 years. Those between 25-35 years constituted 25%  the second highest. So, primarily students are the ones taking these licences and authorising educational institutes will revolutionise the system, Gahlot said. The project will begin with the governments polytechnic colleges. Apart from this, seven colleges under the Delhi government such as the Ambedkar University are also being roped in. Around 88 colleges under Delhi University will also be included. Explaining the process, officials said the online test will be conducted at colleges once a week. Students will be able to take the test either in English or Hindi. The test is just of 10 minutes and will have 10 objective type questions, they said.
