Women, kids can use hotel toilets for free in South Delhi.
Starting Monday, women and children will no longer have to go looking for public washrooms to relieve themselves after a long day of shopping at South Delhi markets. Simply walking into the nearest restaurant and conveying their need to the staff will make posh toilets accessible to them completely free of cost.South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) commissioner Puneet Kumar Goel said that hotels, restaurants and eateries in the area will open their toilets to public use from May 1. However, men have been kept of out of the scheme due to privacy issues cited by various hotel associations. The move would allow women and children to access washrooms even in five-star hotels of South Delhi, Goel said, adding that the decision was taken on a suggestion from lieutenant governor Anil Baijal.We want the hotels and restaurants to take this directive in the right spirit. The facility will be reviewed on the basis of feedback provided by the catering establishments, said SDMC additional commissioner (health) Meeta Singh.National Restaurants Association head Riaz Amlani said women and children find it hardest to locate proper washrooms for use. Security concerns, coupled with the fact that some restaurants and bars dont allow single males, made us keep men out for now, Amlani said.A senior SDMC official said hotel associations were also apprehensive of allowing men because they are more likely to enter drunk. It would not be good for business if such people have to cross paying customers to reach washrooms located at the rear of the establishment, he added.
