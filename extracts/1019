PIL filed seeking 24-hr helpline against cow vigilantes.
A public interest litigation has been filed in Bombay High Court asking for a 24-hour helpline for protection of life for trade and transport during Bakri Eid and against cow vigilantism.The petition also demands that the government should collect information about the cow vigilant sanghathan and all police stations should have a list of all gaurakshaks in their jurisdiction. According to the petitioners the police stations should know who are the so called gau rakshaks who conduct illegal raids.The PIL has been filed by social activist Shadaab Patel who fears such attacks as Bakri Eid is close approaching. Patel said that it is the duty of the State government to protect its citizens, which is why he asks them to come up with guidelines to ensure safety.The petition sites lynchings of cow vigilant groups from across the country including the recent case in Nagpur. Last week a 36-year-old man carrying meat was beaten up by cow vigilant groups who insisted that it was beef. The entire instance was caught on camera by a few people. Police machinery had immediately swung into action and four people were arrested.This petition is likely to be mentioned before the Bombay High Court bench soon.Also Read
