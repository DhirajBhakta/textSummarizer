External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj once again turned a saviour for an Indian woman married in Pakistan after her father's YouTube SOS that his daughter was being mistreated by her in-laws in Pakistan. Swaraj on Monday said that the Indian High Commission had met the woman in Pakistan and was ensuring her safety and return to India.The external affairs minister posted on Twitter that she received a YouTube message from Mohammad Akbar about his daughter Mohammadia Begum who was being ill-treated by her in-laws.She tweeted, "Our mission sent a Note Verbale requesting the safety, security and well-being of Mohammadia Begum." "Our High Commission officials met Mohammadia Begum and she expressed her desire to return to India."As the Hyderabad woman's passport had expired last year, Swaraj asked the Indian High Commission to renew her Indian passport and facilitate her return to India.Meanwhile, Mohammedi Begum (the name on her passport) spoke to her mother Hajara Begum over phone and informed that her husband Muhammad Younis beat her up and locked her in a room after Indian High Commission officials met her.ILL-TREATED BY IN-LAWS The 44-year-old broke down while narrating the ill-treatment at the hands of her husband and in-laws.
