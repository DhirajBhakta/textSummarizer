Casting in films based on famous family or big name: Prachi.
Actor Prachi Desai, who bid goodbye to her TV career in 2009 after doing the popular show Kasamh Se, is miffed with the kind of content Indian television has today. She says, ?It is in a sorry state, and shockingly regressive. I didn?t want to be a part of it. The lesser said about it, the better.?Prachi started her career in Bollywood with the 2008 film Rock On! alongside actor Farhan Akhtar. She subsequently appeared in films such as Once Upon A Time In Mumbaai (2010) and Bol Bachchan (2012). However, she feels that the film industry is quick to stereotype an actor. ?I recently turned down a couple of big films, because they all wanted me to do the same kind of thing again and again. I would rather explore the actor in me than just stand there and be one among the many,? says the 28-year old. Prachi doesn?t deny that people work hard, but still feels it?s a ?gamble?.  ? Everyone here wants to do something interesting, yet be safe in their zone. Also, the people  are still not welcoming to outsiders, because casting is still based on whether you?re a big name or belong to a famous family,? adds Prachi, , who is soon going to appear in a short film, Carbon, alongside actors Nawazuddin Siddiqui and Jackky Bhagnani.Follow @htshowbiz for more
