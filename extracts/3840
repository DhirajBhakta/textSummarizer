Sushant and Kriti's rumoured relationship has been a hot topic for a while now. The couple brought in the New Year together in London with their friends. In fact, it was even rumoured that Kriti's growing proximity to Sushant was what led to the rift between Ankita and him. However, in a recent interview, Kriti said that she was single, although she would not mind being in a relationship with someone from the industry.A few days ago, Sushant took to Twitter to make the announcement about his new ride.I've been playing with the miniature model of this car since I was a kid.
