						Known for his realistic acting for which he has been lauded film after film, Nawazuddin also said he prefers playing characters with grey shades. I do not like a character that is either an extreme villain or a hero. But I think that as time goes by, things are changing. These days, even heroes are playing characters with grey shades because I believe grey characters are more real. There are bad and good characteristics in all of us, said the actor, who is very conscious abut his choice of role.Directed by Kushan Nandy, Babumoshai Bandookbaaz is slated to release on August 25. It also features Bidita Bag, Jatin Goswami and Divya Dutta.Follow @htshowbiz for more
