Lalu Prasad offers Mayawati a Rajya Sabha seat from Bihar.
Amid tension and division within the Opposition, Lalu Prasad has offered to consolidate Dalit votes by making a significant gesture: offer Mayawati a Rajya Sabha seat from Bihar, a day after the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief resigned in protest after she was not allowed to speak in the House.Lalu, who heads the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), tweeted from his handle, @laluprasadrjd: "Spoke with Mayawati Ji in (sic) length. Offered & requested her to be Rajyasabha MP frm Bihar to fight against atrocities & divisive agenda of BJP."WHEN AN ANGRY MAYAWATI WALKED OUT OF RAJYA SABHA On Tuesday, after she was not allowed to raise the atrocities against Dalits in Rajya Sabha, Mayawati tendered her three-page resignation, accusing the ruling BJP and Rajya Sabha chair of not allowing her to raise the issue. Her current term will end in April next year and her party, with just 18 MLAs in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly, is not in a position to send her back to Rajya Sabha."Today would be remembered as a black day in the history when a highly respected Dalit leader was not allowed to raise the voice of poor in the Rajya Sabha," Lalu said on Tuesday, reacting to Mayawati's resignation."If Mayawati wishes, we will send her to Rajya Sabha from Bihar," the RJD president whose party has 80 MLAs in 243-member Bihar Legislative Assembly said. "We are with her," he said."Chanakya had said that an assembly (of people) where a person is not allowed to speak through the force of brute majority is no assembly," he said.Lalu's offer to Mayawati is a part of the RJD supremo's ongoing efforts to stitch a united Opposition front to take on the BJP in the 2019 Lok Sabha election. However, the presidential election and the Goods and Services Tax (GST) rollout have divided the Opposition, with various parties having their own positions.Lalu's support to Mayawati is also being seen as a part of his efforts to bring her and Samajwadi Party leader Akhilesh Yadav together. He has invited the two leaders to the RJD's August 27 rally in Patna.
