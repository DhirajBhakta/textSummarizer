Irfan Pathan slammed for posting 'un-Islamic' pic with wife.
Indian all-rounder Irfan Pathan, on Tuesday, was criticised by many on Instagram as well as on his Facebook page, after he posted a photograph with his wife who can be seen wearing nail polish. Even though Irfans wife Safa Baig  to whom he got married to in February 2016  can be seen wearing a burqa in the photograph, her exposed hands and nail polish has enraged many fans who have posted ridiculous comments.(Read | Nasser Hussain slams abysmal England selection post Trent Bridge loss vs SA) WTF.

Keep your religion mindset somewhere else. Be it hes Muslim or not, its between him and his god, theres no you in between them, Im sure you all know that. I suggest you become a great Muslim What makes you think youre a great Muslim Because you mind someone else business are your own teachings enough to judge other Dont think so. I dont think you have the right to tell him what to tell his wife. His wife looks awesome and they look awesome together, they look like they were going somewhere nice together. Be happy, live happily. Maybe you guys can learn a thing or two if you stop looking at your wife as if shes a thing you order around, wrote Leizs Hol.Does the women hav any rights what she has to doislam k thekedar aagaye ...people r no one to advise what she or irfan does with ther life, (sic) wrote Tushar Narkhede.
