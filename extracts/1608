Sarita set to become India's first female professional boxer.
31-year-old Sarita Devi will become the first ever female professional boxer from India when she takes on seasoned pro Zsofia Bedo of Hungary in a much-anticipated bout in hometown Imphal later this month.The Manipur pugilist, an Arjuna awardee and a former world and national champion, has been training for the January 29 bout under the watchful eyes of 73-year-old American Joe Clough who has coached Evander Holyfield in the past.Sarita's opponent, World Number 29, is a veteran of 59 professional bouts and has, to her credit, 19 wins with an impressive knockout record. Perhaps that's the reason why Sarita wants to take no chances and has even opted for a male sparring and practice partner at the training camp.
