Man accused of raping, killing 8-year-old lynched by mob.
In the second such instance in a week, a man was beaten to death in Jharkhand by a mob. The man, accused of raping and killing an eight-year-old, was lynched in the Ramgarh thana of Dumka district. The lynching was separate and unrelated to Thursday's mob killing of a man suspected of carrying beef. That incident took place near Bajartand village in Ramgarh district. Dumka and Ramgarh districts are located around 300 kilometers apart. The lynching in Dumka took place after a mob after Mithun Hansda allegedly raped and later killed an eight-year-old girl, local newspaper Prabhat Khabar reported. On Tuesday this week, the girl had come to Jalwe village in Dumka district for a wedding. She along with a few others girls from the wedding party went to a nearby lake to take a bath where Hansda, in a drunken state, misbehaved with them, Prabhat Khabar reported. While a few girls managed to run away, Hansda abducted the eight-year-old, took her to the bank of a river outside Jalwe village and allegedly raped her. He is then reported to have killed her and thrown her body among the trees on the river bank. According to Prabhat Khabar, the Hansda went back to the village and joined the wedding party. However, after the eight-year-old did not return, her family started searching for him. In the meantime, the girls who were at the lake where Hansda had misbehaved with them revealed what had happened. Villagers then accosted Hansda who denied that the raped the girl. On Wednesday, villagers again accosted Hansda, tied him to a tree and beat him mercilessly, Prabhat Khabar reported. Hansda reportedly confessed to raping and killing the eight-year-old and then died due to the beating. News agency ANI today reported that the bodies of both Handsa and the eight-year-old girl who was raped were recovered by police and have been sent for post-mortem.
