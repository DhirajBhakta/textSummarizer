Mumbai Police may close AIB's PM Modi meme case: Report.
 With neither Prime Minister Narendra Modi nor any of his relatives alleging defamation or insult through the meme on Twitter, the Mumbai police are contemplating closing the case against All India Bakchod (AIB) co-founder Tanmay Bhat.On Thursday, the AIB tweeted a picture of Modis doppelganger peering into his mobile phone at a railway station.They also uploaded a picture of Modi superimposed with a Snapchat filter with #Wanderlust, allegedly meant to mock Modis frequent foreign trips. After receiving a barrage of insults and hate messages from trolls, the group deleted its post.A senior police official told HT the case is weak. He said the post against Modi led to outrage on Twitter, with a complaint on the official Mumbai police Twitter handle too. Taking note of the complaint, the police booked the group for obscenity and defamation under the IT Act and IPC. Legal experts like Majeed Memon, Abha Singh, Dr Olav Albuquerque said the aggrieved person, in this case Modi,  should file the defamation case. Albuquerque said the police can file an FIR only when they have consent of Modi or any of his relatives. Even as police officials close to the investigation are refusing to come on record they said the case may not stand in court..
