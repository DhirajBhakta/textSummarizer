NHAI cuts over 8,000 trees in Gurugram to build flyovers.
Millennium city in Gurugram is paying a heavy price for roads and big infrastructure projects. Local forest department sources told Mail Today on Friday that the NHAI has chopped more than 8,000 trees to develop a flyover and three underpasses. Environmentalists are criticising NHAI for this "eco-disaster in the name of development". Meteorological department officials too raised concerns about possible increase in temperature by 2 to 3 degrees. Sources said the road agency has not given any blueprint about developing green channels to compensate for felled trees. "Trees were chopped mercilessly and many of these were fullgrown and more than 25 years old," said Vivek Kamboj, a city based environmentalist.
