This will be a proactive approach to tackle the hate spread online, he said while speaking to the media in Patiala.He said that some forces sitting in foreign countries have nefarious design to disturb peace and harmony in Punjab. They are trying to vitiate the communal atmosphere of the state. However, people have suffered a decade of militancy, and are well aware.
