With less than 10 days to go for the MCD polls, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has released a booklet criticising the BJP's work. Titled 'MCD: Most Corrupt Department', the booklet accuses the BJP-ruled MCD of corruption, having ghost employees, pension scam, misgovernance and of having dearth of funds.
