Old story all knew, no one talked about: Comedian on TVF row.
New Delhi, Mar 30 (PTI) Comedian Radhika Vaz today said that the sexual harassment allegations against The Viral Fever (TVF) founder Arunabh Kumar were sad but not shocking. "This is sad, but not surprising or shocking. The reason I say this is because what surrounds sexual harassment has not changed. The only thing that has changed is that now we have guys in skinny jeans that are harassing us. "Personally, I dont know this guy, but I was told that this is an old story which everyone knew and no one talked about," Vaz said while addressing a session, which was held as part of the She Leads India conference by UN Women in partnership with SheThePeople.TV. The comedian drew laughs by comparing Arunabh with famous American entertainer Bill Cosby, who has been accused of sexual assault allegations by multiple women. "He is our proud Bill Cosby, now no American should think that only they have one," she quipped. Vaz, who calls herself a "feminist first" and a "comedian later", said things will remain the same unless "parents start teaching their children about how to behave with the other gender". "Rarely do I see parents talking to their children about sex, or on how to behave with girls. And then they are sent to schools and colleges which further segregate boys and girls.
