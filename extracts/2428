I'm blessed that you even know I exist: Ranveer to Amitabh.
Remember when Amitabh Bachchan sulked over Sonam Kapoor not replying to his SMS that he sent on her birthday This time, Ranveer Singh finds himself in Sonam's position. Apparently, Big B sent Ranveer a text message on his birthday, but received no response.Amitabh Bachchan wrote on one of Ranveer's replies to a birthday wish, "hey .. but what about my intention .. sent you sms greetings for your birthday .. did not get a reply .. did you see it .. !"However, while Sonam missed his message in the ocean of tweets, texts and birthday posts, Ranveer made sure he did not forget to reply to Big B's text. The Bajirao Mastani actor responded, "Except that i TOTALLY replied! I just cross checked it too! You were in fact one of the first to even wish!"Ranveer then went on to say that it's gestures like these which make Amitabh Bachchan the greatest of all time, adding, "I'm blessed that you even know I exist!"
