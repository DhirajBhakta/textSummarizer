BJP leader posts image from film to show WB Hindus' plight.
Even as West Bengal continues to simmer in the riots in the aftermath of an objectionable Facebook post that went viral, a Haryana state executive of BJP is under fire for sharing a post condemning the fate of Hindus in Mamata Banerjee's state. What makes this Facebook post by BJP's Haryana leader Vijeta Malik incredulous is that she blatantly used an image from a Bhojpuri film starring its much revered leader Manoj Tiwari. Mallik while condemning the treatment meted to Hindus in the state, shared a picture of woman getting disrobed in public. The picture is a scene from one of Manoj Tiwari's popular Bhopuri films 'Aurat khilona nahi'. The post that went viral on Twitter soon triggered a barrage of scathing criticism from twitterati. Comments ranged from calling the post outright distasteful to demanding the arrest of Malik for inciting violence.In her Facebook post, Malik said that the state of Hindus in West Bengal was unfortunate and she asked that why were they being constantly targeted. The post in Hindi says that Hindus are being maligned in public. In the Facebook post, Malik asked why there was no 'award vapsi' and why the state government was apathetic to the humiliation faced by Hindus. She accused the Mamata-led government of being a mute spectator when Hindus are being subjected to ill-treatment.
