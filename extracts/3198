Parineeti lied she was poor: Man claiming to be classmate.
At a recent event, Parineeti Chopra shared a touching story about her childhood struggles. The actor said that growing up, her family was poor and she could not afford a car to go to school. Parineeti talked about being eve-teased as she cycled to school every day, and how she has become a stronger person as a result of facing such struggles very early in her life.However, if a guy supposedly from Parineeti's school, is to be believed, the actor's rags-to-riches story is a lie. Kkanoo Gupta took to Facebook to slam Parineeti for "lying through the teeth" about her impoverished background."Shame...coming from a privileged background and lying through the teeth in front of camera. I guess this is what being a celebrity means. Create a fabricated sob story of no money no car etc etc (sic)," he wrote.He added, "Coming from the same school I probably also remember the car her father used to have. And going to school on a cycle was a trend those days and also a privilege not everyone had. My friends from CJM (Convent of Jesus and Mary) would probably understand the lies a bit better (sic)."Comments on the post seem to agree that Parineeti came from an influential family in Ambala and even cited her education at the University of Manchester as an example.
