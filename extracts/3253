Hunter dies after elephant he was hunting falls on him.
There is an idiom that elders often throw around: Pick on someone your own size. The keyword here is 'size'.A professional South African hunter in Zimbabwe, who specialised in 'big game' hunting, ended up being crushed to death under an elephant that had been shot.Theunis Botha, 51, was hunting at the Hwange National Park with his group, when he crossed paths with a herd of pregnant elephants. The elephants did not quite like this sudden meet-up with gun-carrying humans, and so, came charging at the hunters.In retaliation, Botha started firing at the charging animals. What he did not see, however, is that one elephant was coming towards him from the side. Before Botha knew it, he was up in the air by this elephant's trunk.Seeing this, one of the other hunters shot the elephant swinging Botha by its trunk, but they probably did not see how this could end. The wounded elephant released Botha, dropped him to the ground, and then collapsed right on top of him.Needless to say, Botha did not survive the crush.
