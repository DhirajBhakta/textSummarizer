BJP MP backs claim of Modi's conspiracy against Advani.
Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) chief Lalu Prasad today found an unusual support from BJP leader Vinay Katiyar over his remark that Supreme Court's revival of the conspiracy charge against BJP veteran LK Advani in the Babri Masjid demolition case was a conspiracy of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to remove the party veteran from the Presidential race. "May be his (Lalu's) statement has truth in it. I don't know," Katiyar, who is a member of Rajya Sabha, said. Katiyar's statement is certain to raise a few eyebrows in the BJP leadership, which has reportedly assured Advani that the party is with him after the Supreme Court ruling that he along with Murli Manohar Joshi and Union Minister Uma Bharti will have to face criminal conspiracy charge in Babri Masjid demolition case.Katiyar, the founder leader of Bajrang Dal, is one of the BJP leaders named in the Babri demolition case who would also face trial along with the party veterans. WHAT LALU HAD SAID: "The CBI is in the hands of the Prime Minister, and the CBI said in court that the case of conspiracy should take place against Advani in the Babri case. Advani was tipped to become President this time," Lalu had said in Patna soon after the Supreme Court's ruling."The PM has clipped Advani's chances of becoming the President. Anyone can understand that it is a political conspiracy of the Modi government to eliminate Advani from the race," he added.
