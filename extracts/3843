HC reduces sentence saying man wanted to burn, not kill wife.
Bombay High Court has reduced the life sentence of a man who set his wife on fire, saying he only wanted to burn her and not kill her.According to an Indian Express report, Justice VK Tahilramani noted in his judgement that the man convicted for killing his wife, "only wanted to inflict burns and not kill her but unfortunately the situation slipped out of control to a fatal extent."The court also took note of the man's attempts to save his wife, after he set on fire -- by throwing water on her and rushing her to a hospital -- to pass the judgement reducing his sentence to 10 years. Justice Tahilramani also referred to a similar Supreme Court order to support his judgement. The charges against him were also brought down to culpable homicide not amounting to murder."After the wife caught fire, the accused extinguished the fire and took his wife to the hospital. This conduct cannot be seen divorced from the totality of the circumstances," said Justice Tahilramani."It was obvious that the accused realised his folly and was filled with remorse, therefore, he extinguished the fire and took his wife to the hospital. In view of the evidence on record, we are inclined to think that all that the appellant thought of was to inflict burns and not to kill her but unfortunately the situation slipped out of control to a fatal extent," Justice Tahilramani noted.The order has left people fuming.poor man -- he wanted to only burn his wife. not kill her. oops galti ho gaya, says bombay HC sigh https://t.co/H0Ze9bsInfGreat.
