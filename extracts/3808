Anna Hazare to launch public protest if RTI Act amended.
Ahmednagar (Maha), Apr 13 (PTI) Amid reports that the Centre is planning to amend the RTI Act, social activist Anna Hazare has written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, urging him not to do so as it would dilute its provisions and would be an "injustice" to common people. "The central government is mulling to bring changes in the Right to Information (RTI) Act. The Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) has given information about it on its website," Hazare said in the letter made public today. "It is the fundamental right of the people to know how their money is being spent and what kind of work the government is doing. Bringing changes in the RTI Act, which people have got after years of agitations, is like damaging their fundamental right. We feel that it is an attempt to weaken this historic law," he said. The government has proposed a new set of rules for processing Right to Information applications, complaints and appeals and has sought suggestions from the public by April 15. The proposed rules, aimed at replacing RTI rules of 2012, have been placed by the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) on its website for comments from public. Hazare said he was opposed to the proposed change in allowing withdrawal of appeal to the CIC. If this is allowed, there can a situation where the applicant would be pressurised to withdraw his appeal, he said. The anti-corruption crusader said he was also against the proposal to terminate the appeal proceedings upon the death of the applicant. Pointing out that there have been 56 cases of murder of RTI applicant in the last year, Hazare said the proposed change will make the things more dangerous. Hazare also opposed the proposed limit of 500 words for an RTI application saying that it would be unjust for common people.
