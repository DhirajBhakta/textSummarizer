164% rise in terror-related civilian deaths in J&K in a year.
The killing of seven Hindu pilgrims in southern Kashmir en route from the holy cave of Amarnath is the latest bloody statistic in Jammu & Kashmir (J&K), which has witnessed a 45% rise in terrorism-related deathsand 164% increase in civilian deaths aloneover the year ending June 30, 2017 according to an IndiaSpend analysis of data from the South Asian Terrorism Portal, run by the New Delhi-based Institute for Conflict Management, a nonprofit.Unidentified terrorists reportedly opened fire on a police vehicle at around 8 pm on July 10. When police retaliated, the terrorists fired indiscriminately, and a bus full of pilgrims returning from Amarnath was caught in the crossfire, according to the police. Others said there was no crossfire and the pilgrims were targets, with later reports saying the bus was attacked twice in three minutes.The Kashmir Police blamed the Laskhar-e-Taiba (LeT), a terror group, for the attack, alleging it was masterminded by Pakistani terrorist Abu Ismail. LeT spokesperson Abdullah Ghaznavi, however, denied the charges and blamed Indian agencies for the highly reprehensible act, the deadliest on Amarnath pilgrims in 15 years.Kashmiris, including separatists, were quick to condemn the attack.#Hurriyat activists join HR groups civil society members & students to condemn killings ofYatris & express solidarity withBereaved families pic.twitter.com/a5zPE2cdjg Mirwaiz Umar Farooq (@MirwaizKashmir) July 11, 2017Widespread criticism of the terrorists in Kashmir drew a reaction from Indias home minister, Rajnath Singh.The people of Kashmir have strongly condemned the terror attack on Amarnath yatris.
