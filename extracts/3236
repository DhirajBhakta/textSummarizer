Virat Kohli is the best dancer in Indian team: Ashwin.
Ravichandran Ashwin, on the sidelines of winning the International Cricketer of the Year award at the CEAT Cricket Rating (CCR) International awards 2017, revealed that Virat Kohli is the best dancer in the Indian team."Virat and Suresh are the best dancers and singers," Ashwin spoke about the liveliness in the dressing room.Kohli was last seen dancing and enjoying himself at Yuvraj Singh's wedding along with girlfriend Anushka Sharma. Kohli has never been shy of dancing and is always seen displaying his moves in various parties of the Royal Challengers Bangalore.Ashwin is a part of the 15-man squad that is set to defend their ICC Champions Trophy title in England from June 4.On being asked about the kind of wickets he is expecting and the team's mindset regarding the competition, Ashwin said, "Limited overs format is generally not for bowlers. I expect placid wickets. I believe the way to handle pressure is to take one game at a time and we're not thinking about being defending champions."Ashwin also spoke about the changes in ODI rules and how he plans to work around them."There have been a lot of changes to the ODI rules. There is no point of going with same skills. I have been applying my mind to it all and hopefully I will be able to give something new," Ashwin said.
