Maha hikes compensation for rape survivors to ?10 lakh .
 The Maharashtra government has decided to increase compensation for rape and acid attack survivors to Rs10 lakh. This compensation, however, will be for those survivors, who have been meted with the most horrific acts of violence, including gang-rape, leading to physical and mental disability. The state cabinet on Tuesday took this decision to increase the compensation offered under the 2013 ?Manodhairya? scheme to provide financial assistance to survivors. The scheme offered assistance of up to Rs3 lakh. ?In cases where women face gang-rape or permanent physical or mental disability through violent actions, such survivors need the maximum amount of help for rehabilitation. But there may also be other cases where rape is attempted on the pretext of marriage or the crime doesn?t lead to permanent physical trauma or disfigurement. Considering this, we have categorised compensation for different cases,? said Vinita Singhal, principal secretary, women and child development department.?In the most cruel crime, where the survivor faces permanent disability, financial assistance will be Rs10 lakh. Of this, 25% or Rs2.5 lakh will be disbursed immediately to the survivor while the remaning Rs7.5 lakh will be a fixed deposit in the bank and the survivor will continue to get monthly interest on it,? she said.For other cases, the monetary help will be Rs3 lakh, Rs2 lakh and Rs1 lakhUnder the old scheme, the state government would give a maximum of Rs3 lakh to survivors who suffered from complete disfigurement of the face or physical handicap in case of an acid attack, while those with minor injuries were getting Rs50,000.Apart from the monetary compensation, the government, under this scheme, also provides counselling to the survivors and vocational or educational training.
