CBSE denies textbook said 36-24-36 was ideal female figure.
The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has denied reports that its Class 12 textbook has suggested 36-24-36 figure to be the best body shape for females."The reference to CBSE in this news is vehemently denied. It is totally incorrect and does not have any credible base," a statement issued by the board said.The book referred to in the media reports is titled 'Health and Physical Education' authored by Dr VK Sharma and published by New Saraswati House."CBSE does not recommend books by any private publishers to the affiliate schools. Rule 15.1 (d) of the Affiliation-bye-laws of the Board clearly states that the school will follow the syllabus on the basis of curriculum prescribed by NCERT/CBSE and textbooks published by NCERT or CBSE as far as practicable," the statement said.According to the rules, schools have to exercise extreme care while selecting books of private publishers."The content must be scrutinised to preclude any objectionable content that hurts the feelings of any class, community, gender, religious group in society if prescribing books having such content, the school will have to take the responsibility of such content," the CBSE said."The action seems to be wilful and only to malign the name of a responsible organisation like CBSE," it said.The textbook had even reasoned that Miss World and Miss Universe beauty pageants take the 36-24-36 body shape into consideration while judging their contestants.
