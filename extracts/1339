Bombay High Court to appoint committee to review Jolly LLB 2.
The Aurangabad bench of the Bombay High Court has ordered a three-member committee to review the Akshay Kumar-starrer Jolly LLB 2 on Wednesday. The court also asked the committee to find out whether the allegations levelled by petitioner Ajaykumar Waghmare are true.Waghmare is a practising lawyer from Nanded, who had said that the film is "nothing but an attempt to portray the Indian Legal Profession and Judicial System as a laughing stock to the society at large."

The characters jumping on the judge's dais and fighting in court shows mockery of the court.Waghmare had formed his opinion after watching the trailers. He also attached a copy of the trailer in his petition as well. However, senior lawyer P M Shah appearing for the filmmaker has quashed the baseless allegations and said that the complete picture of the film cannot be formed on the basis of trailers. The bench, consisting of justices VM Kanade and Sangitrao Patil said, "We have seen  the photographs; one of which shows a lawyer jumping on the dais and arguing with the judge. The second photograph shows the judge hiding  below the dais and passing some orders by banging the gavel on the table." With this, the court felt that "prima facie, though the above referred photographs do indicate total disrespect or disregard to the high office of this court, we cannot jump to that conclusion unless the contexts in which these scenes are shown, are examined in their proper perspective".Thus, the court felt that it is necessary to appoint a committee as amicus curiae to watch the film and submit a report.
