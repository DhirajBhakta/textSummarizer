They were elated to lift me: MLA carried by people in mud.
Biju Janata Dal (BJD) MLA Manas Madkami loves his sparkling white shoes so much that he wouldn't mind being lifted and carried by his supporters to prevent them from getting dirty.This was evident when he allowed a couple of men carry him across a muddy patch during a visit to his home constituency - Malkangiri on Tuesday (July 11). The video of the incident has now gone viral.The act was captured on camera when MLA Madkami and Nabarangpur MP Balabhadra Majhi had visited some panchayats in Motu area in the district to take stock of welfare projects. #WATCH: BJD MLA Balabhadra Majhi carried by his supporters to cross a waterlogged stretch in Odisha's Malkangiri yesterday pic.twitter.com/GZV8MCdSYw While Nabarangpur MP crossed the muddy water without the help of supporters, MLA Madkami preferred to be carried by his supporters to keep his shoes and crisp white dress clean and dry.
