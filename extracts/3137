I would like to adopt children, no uncertainty about it: Dia.
While Bollywood celebrities like Karan Johar and Tusshar Kapoor have gone the surrogacy route to become parents, Dia Mirza might opt for adoption. The actor told Deccan Chronicle that she has given it a lot of thought and is keen on it."This has been a recurring thought, and I have been discussing and thinking about it for a while. Procreation is such a natural human process, yet see the population density on the planet, and you are forced to question whether we need to procreate," she said.Dia added, "It's a serious dialogue we've engaged in, but honestly, we haven't arrived at any conclusion. But we would like to adopt children. There's no uncertainty about that."The actor wants to have a family, but is conflicted about whether she should "add to the exploding population" or adopt a child. "So many questions between the head and the heart,  but I am sure we will arrive at a conclusion because I want to," she said.On the work front, Dia Mirza will play Maanayata Dutt in Rajkumar Hirani's Sanjay Dutt biopic featuring Ranbir Kapoor.
