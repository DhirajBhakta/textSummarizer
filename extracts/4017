I do want to settle down early in life, says Alia Bhatt.
The nation's favourite 'dulhania' Alia Bhatt is just 24, but marriage might not be very far off into the future for her. In an interview with Hindustan Times, Alia said, "I do want to settle down early (in life) because I have an advantage of having started off (in career) very early. That way, I can get done with it (getting married) and continue (in my career). Also, I don't want to settle down too late in life because that also has its own issues." However, the Dear Zindagi actor added that she is not "thinking about it or planning as of now."Ever since she made her debut with Student Of The Year, Alia's name has been linked with her co-star Sidharth Malhotra's. Although the two have been in denial mode, several hints have been dropped. When Varun Dhawan was asked on Koffee With Karan what Sidharth had that he did not, he looked suggestively at Alia. Last week, the rumoured couple walked hand-in-hand out of a recent award show. In fact, Sidharth was even clicked entering Alia's house on Valentine's Day. When it comes to marriage, Sidharth seems to have somewhat different views. He had told DNA, "In today's day and age, marriage has become just a tagline. I think I will only get married when I want to have babies." We wonder how Sidharth will react to Alia's admission that she wants to get married soon.
