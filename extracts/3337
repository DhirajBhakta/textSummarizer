Rajamouli, I'm sorry for my wrong review of Baahubali 2: KRK.
Self-proclaimed critic Kamaal R Khan incurred the wrath of Baahubali fans when he called Baahubali 2: The Conclusion a "ch*tiyapa" film. KRK had also said that the film's "real audience" down South might like the film, but claimed that Hindi audiences would not tolerate such a film. Well, the joke is on him, because the Hindi-dubbed version of SS Rajamouli's film created the existence of the Rs 400 crore club.As of now, Baahubali 2 has made Rs 413.75 crore in Hindi alone, with a worldwide collection of Rs 1330 crore. Kamaal R Khan was forced to take his words and apologise to SS Rajamouli, who he had referred to as the "greatest ch*tiya director of the decade (sic)." Taking to Twitter, he wrote, "I m very sorry for my wrong review of #Baahubali2! I didn't like it but ppl like it n Janta Ki Awaaz means Nakkare Khuda. Sorry @ssrajamouli (sic)."I m very sorry for my wrong review of #Baahubali2! I didn't like it but ppl like it n Janta Ki Awaaz means Nakkare Khuda. Sorry @ssrajamouli
