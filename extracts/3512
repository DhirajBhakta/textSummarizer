Incredible heights of fiction: Shraddha on dating rumours.
Shraddha Kapoor and Farhan Akhtar's rumoured relationship continues to be the hottest topic of discussion for gossipmongers. That Farhan is now legally divorced from Adhuna Bhabani has added fuel to the fire and it was being said that he is planning to make his relationship with Shraddha official soon. This comes after reports that the couple had moved in together, which led to Shraddha's father Shakti Kapoor forcibly dragging her back to their house."The level of fiction can go to incredible heights. I choose to ignore them and just focus on my work," Shraddha told Mumbai Mirror, responding to the reports of her alleged affair. She admitted that Farhan was a friend, however.The OK Jaanu actor had earlier slammed the media for going "overboard." She had told PTI that she is usually unfazed but involving her family was unfair. "The link-up rumours have not affected me at all, but this time it did as it involved my family. If you paint a wrong picture and involve family, it's not fair," Shraddha had said.On the work front, Shraddha will be next seen in Half Girlfriend opposite Arjun Kapoor, which is set to release on May 19. She will also be seen in Haseena (based on the life of Dawood Ibrahim's sister Haseena Parkar) and Saina (the biopic of ace badminton player Saina Nehwal).
