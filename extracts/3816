Denmark recycles urine to make beer.
Will you prefer this lager made using the urine of music lovers?Danish Agriculture and Food Council announced the relaunch of a bizarre recycling project taking help from music festivals.This year, people taking leaks at the music festival called Roskilde, will be helping out by providing a key ingredient for the production of liquid gold pilsner (lager beer originally brewed in Czech Republic).The plan is to collect urine from special urinals and storage tanks, which will be used to fertilize malting barley, which may further create pisstory.For now, the lager is called 'pilsner' but the Danish Agriculture and Food Council has posed other suggestions like 'Yellow ale' and 'Pale piss' on its official Twitter page. Pale piss, seriously Denmark?I 2015 startede #beercycling på Roskilde Festival - Nu skal vi fra pis til pilsner, men hvad skal øllen hedde?? #cirkulærøkonomi cc @drp3pic.twitter.com/MYwE2yP9Xj"Just as we have seen shops sell goods that would otherwise have been thrown out, Beercycling allows us to recycle a product that is normally flushed down the drain,"Ruptly quoted Karen Haekkerup, CEO of the Danish Agriculture and Food Council."When it comes to the circular economy, Danish farmers are some of the best in the world. If you can brew a beer with urine as fertilizer, you can recycle almost anything," she said. Watch 'beercycling' here:
