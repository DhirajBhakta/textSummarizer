US thought India will capture PoK after 1971 Bdesh war: CIA.
New Delhi, Jan 27 (PTI) The US government had thought that the then Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi might order an attack on West Pakistan to capture Pakistan-Occupied- Kashmir after Indias operation to create Bangladesh got over, recently declassified CIA documents say. As per CIA reports and minutes of high-level meetings in Washington on Indo-Pak tensions, it was clear that the US government was readying a strategy should India smash military power of West Pakistan. US President Richard Nixons National Security Adviser Henry A Kissinger discussed various possibilities due to deteriorating Indo-Pak ties in the wake of Indias military offensive in East Pakistan. However, some top security officials in Washington felt the possibility of India launching a strike on West Pakistan was remote. At one of the meetings of Washingtons Special Action Group, the then CIA Director Richard Holmes said, "It is reported that prior to terminating the present hostilities, Mrs Gandhi intends to attempt to eliminate Pakistans armour and air force capabilities," as per papers which are part of nearly 12 million documents CIA declassified last week. According to the documents, though Nixon had "warned India to cut off economic aid in case of war in East Pakistan, the US administration was clueless on how to implement it.
