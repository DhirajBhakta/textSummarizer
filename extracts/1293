It was a fairytale romance - they even kissed for the first time after watching Romeo and Juliet! And while she was smitten, her parents hated him. It is no surprise, because she went on to reveal that her father actually caught them making out.Sunny elaborates, "I was at school, and I lied that I had to do after-school stuff. I was at one end of the hallyway, sitting on his lap and we were making out, and I hear my dad walking down the hallway. And he goes, 'Gogu (her nickname)!' I was like, 'Oh my god, my dad just caught me making out with this boy.' It was the WORST, and the car ride home was even more horrible."
