Congress calls Kashmir 'Indian-occupied Kashmir' in booklet.
In a major goof up, the Uttar Pradesh Congress today released a booklet in Lucknow in which Kashmir has been labeled as Indian-occupied Kashmir. The booklet, which targets the BJP-led NDA government as it completes three years and highlights its failures, was released by Ghulam Nabi Azad  and Raj Babbar.The 11th page of the 16-page booklet talks of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and carries a map of the project. The map, seen by India Today, carries the label 'India-occupied Kashmir' for the area of Kashmir. Text appearing alongside the map says that the $54 billion CPEC will pass through Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir to connects Gwadar Port in the Arabian sea to China. In a bid to target the BJP, Congress wonders if the project raises questions over India's claim on PoKAt the press conference, Ghulam Nabi Azad raised issues of national security being jeopardized by the BJP and spoke about a spurt in terror-related violence in the country. The Congress also targeted the BJP saying that the ruling party has been lax in securing India's borders and that the defence preparedness of India has been compromised under the Narendra Modi government. Azad also indicated that the state of Jammu and Kashmir is in turmoil and that Naxalism has been rearing its ugly head and their attacks have become more spectacular in nature. Meanwhile, Congress leader Ajay Maken said it was a "printing error" but admitted that it was his party's responsibility to ensure that such a mistake was not allowed."We apologise for this and will ensure that such a mistake is not repeated," he said.ALSO READ:Indian map includes Pakistan, Bangladesh in Morocco university goof-up while hosting Hamid Ansari
