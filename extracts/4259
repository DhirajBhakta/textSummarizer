16 yrs since Laxman and Dravid's 376-run stand against Aus.
Back in the summer of 2001, India were far removed from the modern-day Test giants they were - even on home soil, when a mighty Australia came to visit for a three-Test series.India, it would seem, were hardly prepared for the men from down under. They had been whitewashed 3-0 by the Aussies the previous summer and on their return home, South Africa drubbed them 2-0.There was then the one-off Test against Bangladesh and two more Tests against Zimbabwe. India managed two win two of those but not without stiff resistance from the opposition.And when the much-hyped series against Australia got underway in the March of 2001, there was little doubt who would triumph. The Aussies, led by Steve Waugh, steamrolled India in Mumbai to extend their winning streak.Things looked just as bleak in the next Test at the Eden Gardens. Australia had piled up 445 and India were knocked out for 171 and following on, were tottering at 115/3 when Rahul Dravid joined VVS Laxman in the middle. The Eden crowd was aghast. Sourav Ganguly and Sachin Tendulkar, the most established batsmen in the team, were gone and Australia were breathing fire.Laxman had shown class in his 21 Tests up until that point - few would have forgotten his 167 in Sydeny. Dravid was considered to be extremely talented but India had yet to see the flair they would go on to produce for the next decade.March 14, 2001 was when they first saw what these two could do. With their backs against the wall, India roared back as Laxman and Dravid orchestrated one of the greatest comebacks in Test cricket. They were 254/4 at stumps on day 3. When the duo resumed proceedings on the fourth day, Australia would have hoped to wrap things up quickly.
