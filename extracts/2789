JD(U) slams Modi for making cow an agenda to polarise votes.
The Janta Dal United (JDU) has slammed Prime Minister Narendra Modi after he made an emotional pitch in Gujarat on Thursday asserting that killing in the name of cow protection was unacceptable. The JD-U, hitting out at the prime minister, said that there has been a spurt in incidents of lynching and killing in the name of "gau raksha" across the country because the BJP government made cow a national agenda for seeking and polarising votes.Speaking to India Today, JD-U spokesperson Neeraj Kumar said that PM Modi was more interested in votes in the name of cow rather than "gau seva"."PM has had to appeal the gau rakshaks for the second time not to kill people in the name of cow. This is because PM has made cow the national agenda for doing politics and this had to be the result. PM was not interested in gau seva but polarisation of votes in the name of gau," said Kumar. MOST LYNCHING INCIDENTS HAPPENED IN BJP-RULED STATES Kumar said that it was BJP-ruled states like Haryana, Maharashtra and Jharkhand which reported most of the cases of killing and lynching. He demanded that making emotional appeals was not enough and the government should ensure harshest punishment for people accused of indulging in killings in name of cow protection."It seems that the authority of PM Modi is declining, especially in BJP-ruled states where there are several fake gau rakshaks. PM should feel ashamed of this. Has he become so weak that he has to make appeal to gau rakshaks He should take strict action against such fake gau rakshaks and speedy trial should take place so that justice is done, and these fake gau rakshaks are sent to jail," added the JDU spokesperson.Neeraj Kumar said that the Narendra Modi government was not bothered about development and employment but only about gau, gobar and beef.
