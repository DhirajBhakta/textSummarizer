First met SRK with a drunk girl hanging on to him: Imtiaz.
Even after two and a half decades in Bollywood, Shah Rukh Khan continues to make women go weak in the knees just by flashing his dimpled smile. Jab Harry Met Sejal director Imtiaz Ali told DNA about the time he first met SRK, and it will have the actor's female fans fall more in love with him."It was in London for a film festival. We all were hanging out and I saw Shah Rukh coming up a very narrow aisle somewhere in the hotel, with a drunk girl hanging on to him. He was dealing with her so gracefully without demeaning her," the filmmaker said.Imtiaz said that Shah Rukh was extremely gentle with the girl and did not lose his cool at any point of time. "Gauri (Khan, Shah Rukh's wife) was also with him and everybody was trying to deal with this crazy fan. He was particularly being nice to the girl. When he saw me, he stopped, and we had quite a long conversation even as the girl kept murmuring 'Oh Shah Rukh, Oh Shah Rukh' all over him. He was dealing with her like how one would deal with a scarf. He put her arm on one side of the shoulder and continued to talk to me," he added.Shah Rukh and Imtiaz are collaborating for the first time in Jab Harry Met Sejal, which also features Anushka Sharma. The film is set to release on August 4.ALSO READ: Shah Rukh Khan almost had us believing Varun Dhawan and Alia Bhatt are in love
