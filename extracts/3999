Messi denies abusing officials, says he was yelling at air.
Argentina star striker Lionel Messi has asserted his innocence after being hit with a four-match international ban for verbally abusing an official, saying that he was yelling `to the air`.The action has been taken by FIFA's disciplinary panel against Messi for his insults aimed at - and comments about the mother of - Brazilian assistant referee Dewson Silva during Argentina's 1-0 win over Chile last week.The Barcelona forward was caught on video invoking "the c*** of [Silva's] mother" as he appeared livid against an officiating decision. Match referee Sandro Ricci did not include the incident in his report but FIFA confirmed they were investigating regardless after being made aware of the footage.
