Been working since I was 19, so break was torturous: Akshaye.
impact Mumbai, Jun 25 (PTI) Actor Akshaye Khanna, who has starred as a lead in several films, says he has consciously decided to take up smaller but effective roles in his second innings in Bollywood. Akshaye was recently seen as a baddie in Varun Dhawan- John Abraham starrer "Dishoom" and is now busy promoting his next film "Mom" that features Sridevi in the lead. "I decided, having taken an off of four years, I wanted to start off with slightly smaller roles to get into that zone. But I was sure I wont do it by compromising on the quality of work. The role could be small, but it should have an impact in the story," Akshaye told PTI. Akshaye, 42, who has been working since the age of 19, was away from the silver screen for four years due to personal reasons. The actor says he felt tortured while he was not doing films. "There was a reason why I took a sabbatical. I had some personal reasons which didnt allow me to work. But there has never been a point in my life where I wanted to take things slow, or I dont want to work. "Besides work (acting), there is nothing I know or can do. I have been working nonstop since I was 19 so not working is torturous. That phase has gone now." Even though he was away from films for a while but Akshaye refrains from calling the phase as his comeback. "I wont say its my comeback. There were some reasons because of which I couldnt work. Now, it doesnt matter what adjectives people give it. I am enjoying working now. "I am glad people enjoyed my role in Dishoom and my role in Mom is fantastic. In a way, both Nawazuddin Siddiqui (co-star) and I have extended cameos in the film. We may have had only 20 days of work but the impact (of our characters) is huge," says Akshaye, who is playing an investigative officer in the movie.
