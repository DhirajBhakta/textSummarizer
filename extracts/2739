In a shocking case of medical negligence, a newborn who was declared dead by doctors in a hospital in Telangana, was found alive before it was to be buried. The incident took place at MGM Hospital in Warangal district on Sunday. As the parents were preparing for the baby's funeral, they observed some movement in the baby's body. They immediately rushed to the hospital for treatment. After a few hours of treatment, the baby was declared dead.Responding to the incident, the doctors said ECG machines were not working in the morning.Last month, a similar case of negligence took place at Delhi's Safdarjung hospital, when the maternity ward attendants at the hospital told 27-year-old Rohit Tandon that his wife Shanti had given birth to a stillborn baby.The doctor and the nursing staff sealed the body in a packet, labelled it and gave it to the father. It was at home when Rohit unfolded the sheet to take a last look at his 'lost' son, he felt signs of life in the frail body.However, the case took a tragic turn as the newborn died after struggling to survive for 30 hours. The institute said that the medical procedure was actually an "abortion" and not a "delivery", as the mother was 20 weeks pregnant and the foetus weighed 460 grams.
