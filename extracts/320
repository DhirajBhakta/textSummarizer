Colbert said in a statement about the pick-up. ?I?ve seen some of the footage, and I look forward to sharing the man behind the MAGA.?The show will also feature animated versions of the president?s family members, featuring ?truish adventures of Trump?s confidants and bon vivants ? family, top associates, heads of government, golf pros and anyone else straying into his orbit?, while ?intrepidly exploring their histories and their psyches, revealing insights into what makes them so definitively Trumpian?.Colbert is among a litany of entertainers who?ve mined the White House goings-on for small screen comedy, including Anthony Atamanuik, who plays Trump in Comedy Central?s The President Show, and Saturday Night Live, which regularly features Alec Baldwin?s famed Trump impersonation alongside cast members and guest stars reprising their roles as various members of the president?s inner circle.David Nevins, the president and CEO of Showtime Networks, praised Colbert in a statement about the upcoming series: ?Stephen and Chris have an uncanny genius for deconstructing the world of President Trump, and this series opens a new realm for them.
