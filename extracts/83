DU college to start child care facilities for staff kids.
In a first, a Delhi University college is starting a crèche for its teaching and non-teaching staff, who have to juggle between work and taking care of their young children.Lakshmibai College in Ashok Vihar will start the crèche in August. Teachers can bring their children to the crèche, which will be functional between 9am to 5pm.College principal Pratyush Vatsala said the move will help teachers focus on their work without constantly worrying about their children.As a young teacher, I was constantly worried about my kids. If I had a crèche at my work place then it would have made my life so much easier. A young child needs constant care, she said.The crèche will have a working pantry and at least two support staff to take care of the children.There will be two rooms, one play area and a pantry. We are also planning to renovate an empty garage to be used for older kids where they can do their homework and other things, she said.Permanent teachers get a maternity leave of six months and child care leave of two years, which they can take in breaks or one go.Sonica Sihngvi, a teacher of Economics at the college who is currently on childcare leave, said the crèche will be of great help to her and other parents with toddlers.I was really worried about leaving my child in the care of a nanny. Now I can take my classes without having to worry about my child as I can check on him in the crèche in between classes and breastfeed him, she said.Vatsala said work places need to have such facilities for their employees as it will lead to better results. If the employee is free of tension then he or she can focus on work better. It is good for the individual as well as the institution, she said.Teachers will have to pay Rs4,000 per month for availing the facility. The initial building cost is being borne by the college but the recurring expenditure will be borne by the teachers availing the facility, she said.
