Will gherao MU if results not declared by July 31: Congress.
Mumbai Congress chief Sanjay Nirupam has issued an ultimatum to Mumbai University administration and the Maharashtra government to declare university results on or before July 31, failing which party cadres and NSUI workers will gherao the Mumbai University campus on August 2.According to Congress, over 20 lakh answer sheets are yet to be checked by the university. Students, who had planned to go abroad for further education, are suffering due to this delay.The evaluation of answer sheets has got delayed because of a faulty online paper checking system which Mumbai University hired this year. MeritTrac Services is the firm which made this online paper assessment system. Sanjay Nirupam has alleged that MeritTrac Services got the contract for this paper assessment system without following a proper tendering process due to the tacit support of the BJP.CONGRESS CLAIMS BJP INVOLVED IN MUMBAI UNIVERSITY RESULTS MESS"The information I have got is this. This company is a part of Manipal University. Mohandas Pai is related to Manipal University and everyone knows about his inclination towards BJP. That is why this company is getting contracts in BJP-ruled states, Nirupam alleged. He added, "When Mumbai University was not ready for this system, why did the vice-chancellor award a contract to this particular firm? Before getting the final tender, MeritTrac officials had come to Mumbai for some training to teachers about their online paper assessment system."A few days ago, Yuva Sena Chief Aditya Thackeray had raised this issue with Governor Vidyadagar Rao and demanded action against Maharashtra Education Minister Vinod Tawde and Mumbai University Vice-Chancellor Sanjay Deshmukh for this delay in declaration of Mumbai University results.
