My current girlfriend is not from the film industry: Sooraj.
Sooraj Pancholi, whose relationship with late actor Jiah Khan stirred up a storm, has finally moved on and found love again. Talking to Filmfare, the actor said, "I'm in a relationship. She's not from this industry. She's a nice girl... I always wanted my partner to be a simple person. She can do what she wants, wear what she wants, work wherever she wants. I wanted a simple soul and I guess I've found her."Sooraj, unlike most of his contemporaries, does not mind being in the news for his link-ups. However, he does have a problem if his family is made a part of it. "If I've decided to be a celebrity, I know that it comes at a cost. But people should understand where to draw the line. I don't like it when my family is dragged into things... I walked out of a restaurant with my sister Sana and the next day it was all over the media, 'Sooraj seen with a mystery girl'. That mystery girl was my sister. It's not fair. They should have some protocol."On the work front, Sooraj was last seen in the 2015 film, Hero (also his debut), opposite Athiya Shetty. He will be seen next in a film written by Farook Kabir, based on a true story. Talking about why he took so long to sign on his second film, he said, "It has been a long wait. I wouldn't say a lot of films were offered to me. But yes, there were some offers. I didn't feel convinced enough to do any of those films though."
