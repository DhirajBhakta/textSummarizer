There have been reports saying that the company defaulted on its loan obligations with more than 10 local banks. RCom said that the Rs 25,000 crore that it plans to pay will cover not only all scheduled repayments, but also include substantial pre-payments to all lenders on a pro-rata basis. "RCom is presently engaged in discussions with its lenders to obtain their requisite consent for the two transactions and to refinance scheduled instalments falling due in the interim period up to September 30, 2017, to facilitate expeditious closing of both transactions in the best interests of all stakeholders," an RCom spokesperson added.
