Why was the Lodha Panel set up?.
The Board of Control for Cricket in India has finally had to pay for ignoring Supreme Court's order by not implementing the Lodha Committee reforms as the board president Anurag Thakur and secretary Ajay Shirke have been sacked from their posts by the top court. The apex court on Monday fired the BCCI top brass, and asked Thakur and Shirkey to demit office. All BCCI office bearers who have not followed the norms of Lodha panel to demit office. The Apex court has also issued a show cause notice to Anurag Thakur and Shirkey and asked why they should not be tried for perjury and contempt.   The BCCI and the SC-appointed Lodha Panel have been at loggerheads for a while now. It all started when the spot-fixing scandal broke out during the Indian Premier League in 2013 leading to developments that forced the top court to intervene.Subsequently, the Mudgal Committee was appointed by the Supreme Court, which submitted its report and pointed out irregularities pertaining to the IPL. To help things move further, the Supreme Court appointed a panel in January 2015 headed by former Chief Justice of India, RM Lodha. In July, the panel suspended IPL franchises Chennai Super Kings (CSK) and Rajasthan Royals (RR) for two years, while the teams' co-owners Gurunath Meiyappan and Raj Kundra were banned for life from cricket.

A few of those recommendations were challenged by BCCI and then the apex court had a final word and set a deadline for the the board to implement the suggested reforms in its totality. But, the BCCI continued to stand its ground. Meanwhile, the apex court also asked Thakur to file an affidavit to explain why he had asked the ICC to interfere in the proceedings and submit it to the court on October 17. SGM's were held and the BCCI decided to decline certain orders of the Lodha panel.
