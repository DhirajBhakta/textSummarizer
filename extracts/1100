Saif's daughter Sara replaces Disha Patani in SOTY 2: Report.
Earlier there were reports that Tiger Shroff's girlfriend Disha Patani was going to play the lead opposite Tiger in Student Of The Year 2, directed by Punit Malhotra.However, now, it has been confirmed that Sara Ali Khan, daughter of Saif Ali Khan and Amrita Singh is going to play the role Disha was supposed to play. In short, Sara Ali Khan is making her Bollywood debut with Student Of The Year 2.A source close to the production of the film told DNA, "Disha was finalised as Tiger was keen to have her in the film. It would mean that this off-screen pair would finally woo each other on-screen and that's also interesting for the audience. Producer Karan Johar and director Punit agreed to Disha, as she has a pleasing personality and is confident on screen, as seen in her last release MS Dhoni: The Untold Story and Kung Fu Yoga with Jackie Chan. But for reasons best known to the makers, Disha has made way for Sara."The source added that this is yet another instance of an outsider losing out to a star kid. Karan Johar was indeed planning to launch Sara Ali Khan in a project but her name was attached to the remake of The Fault In Our Stars, which will also star Ishan Khattar, Shahid Kapoor's brother.Interestingly, this is not the first time Disha has lost out on a role opposite lover Tiger Shroff, who is also a star kid. Before this, Disha lost the opportunity to act in Baaghi. Shraddha Kapoor, daughter of Shakti Kapoor stepped in.
