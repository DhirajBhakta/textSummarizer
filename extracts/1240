Air hostess reveals she rescued human trafficking victim.
Though many might dismiss the role of a flight attendant or an air hostess, this story will throw much-needed light on some of the heavy responsibilities these women carry on their shoulders every day.A flight attendant named Sheila Frederick rescued a victim of human trafficking recently. Yes, human trafficking. An attendant for Alaska Airlines, which was running from Seattle to San Francisco on the day, Sheila noticed a 14 or 15-year-old girl looking "dishevelled" sitting next to a fairly well-dressed man, according to 10 News."Something in the back of my mind said something was not right. He was well-dressed. That's what got me because I thought why is he well-dressed and she is looking all dishevelled and out of sorts" Sheila told the news channel.When Sheila tried to talk to them, the man reportedly became defensive and the girl refrained from saying even a word. In a hushed tone then, Sheila told the little girl to go to the toilet, where Sheila had left a note for the teenager, which she later responded to with the message, "I need help".The flight attendant informed the pilots, who were then able to communicate the message to the police in San Francisco, and the man was arrested as soon as the flight landed.
