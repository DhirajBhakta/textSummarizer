Thieves loot Mumbai jewellery store by drilling hole in wall.
A group of thieves enter a jewellery shop by drilling a hole from the store next door, steal jewellery kept on display but dont touch a safe full of gold, and they do so when the CCTV cameras were switched off  all on a night of heavy rain. They also leave behind their tools.The Palghar police feel something doesnt add up and are now probing if the theft could be an inside job. The shop from where the thieves drilled the hole had been closed for three months. They entered through the back room of the jewellery shop and stole Rs8.5 lakh worth of jewellery, while leaving behind the Rs20 lakh worth of gold kept in an iron safe. The CCTV cameras were switched off since July 5.Inspector Kiran Kabadi of the Palghar police said they used an iron rod, screwdriver and other small weapons to break the wall and entered the shop through the same hole. But they left behind their weapons, Kabadi said.The police said there are several loopholes, from the switched off cameras to the heist being timed when the stores owner was hospitalised. We are questioning workers and the store staff. We feel it is an inside job as the shop has been robbed the same way thrice before, Kabadi said.
