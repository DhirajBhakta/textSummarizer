Saw Satyendar giving 2 crore to Kejriwal: Sacked Delhi min.
Rumblings in the Aam Aadmi Party continue today with sacked Delhi Water Minister Kapil Mishra making a dramatic allegation, accusing Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal of corruption. Speaking to reporters at Rajghat today morning, Mishra claimed to have seen Kejriwal accept Rs 2 crore in cash from Delhi Health Minister Satyendra Kumar Jain. The allegations come just a day after Mishra was shunted out of the Arvind Kejriwal cabinet. Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia, however, said Mishra was fired because of mismanagement that resulted in a major water crisis during the MCD polls.The Bharatiya Janata Party and Congress both responded to Mishra's claim by saying that Kejriwal should step down as Delhi chief minister. Meanwhile, the Aam Aadmi Party rubbished Mishra's claims, calling the allegations baseless and undeserving of a response.
