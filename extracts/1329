Sadhvi Pragya, 7 others acquitted in RSS member murder case.
A Dewas court in Madhya Pradesh today acquitted Sadhvi Pragya Singh and seven others in former RSS pracharak Sunil Joshi murder case. Joshi, who had worked as an RSS pracharak for a significant part of his life, was shot dead a few hundred meters from his rented house in Chuna Khadan area of Dewas on December 29, 2007.Only the next day on December 30, a particular community was targeted and four members of a family were killed as Joshi's associates tried to give the murder a communal colour.Later it was suspected that Joshi was eliminated by his own associates so that the police could not track down the saffron terror trail that was allegedly involved in several blasts, including the Samjhauta blasts. Sadhvi Pragya, who was alleged to be in an integral part of the saffron terror network, was later arrested in connection with Sunil Joshi's murder.MURDER CASE TRANSFERRED TO NIA IN 2011The Sunil Joshi murder case was transferred to the NIA in 2011, which probed its connection with terror strikes that were linked with right-wing Hindu extremist organisation Abhinav Bharat.A few months after the NDA came to power at the Centre in 2014, the NIA filed a chargesheet in the Joshi murder case in a special court in Bhopal and ruled out any connection with other terror strikes allegedly carried out by extreme right-wing groups.
