BJP MP equates Priyanka Gandhi to 'special utensil of steel'.
Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi was yet again on the receiving end as BJP leader and union minister Mahendranath Pandey took a jibe on her saying she is like special tool brought by Congress to impress voters in Uttar Pradesh Assembly election.During a poll campaign in UP's Hamirpur, the Union Minister of State for Human Resources Development said, "In houses of Uttar Pradesh villages we keep some special utensils of steel. Whenever special guests visit us then we clean it and keep it on the eating table. After they go away we keep it back"."Whenever election comes, then Congress brings out Priyanka and then keeps her back later on. It would not make a difference (in elections)," Pandey said.
