Pride Parade held in Lucknow for the first time.
18 years after India put together its first Pride Parade (in Kolkata), Lucknow has now joined the club.Lucknow held its first Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Intersex, Queer and Asexual - Pride Parade on Sunday. In a proud moment for the state, LGBTIQA members were also joined by their family members, who came out in support of the participants."Lucknow was the epicentre of gay culture in the Gangetic plain which was evident in even its literature such as Umrao Jan Ada and was suppressed by the British. We are only keeping the tradition alive though the modern Indian political class is ashamed of it," Ashok Row Kavi, chairman of Humsafar Trust, told The Times of India.A lot of people were "surprised" at the size of the turnout. Kavi called the participation "fabulous".Rainbow flags fluttered on the streets of Awadh as a huge crowd marched for 1.5 km from Sikanderbagh Crossing to Gandhi Park at Hazratganj. People from Mumbai, Kolkata, Chandigarh and Jaipur showed up to give Lucknow support And MAAAAAN were they dressed to kill This dude slayed And a LOT of fun was had At the end of the day though, their message was clear
