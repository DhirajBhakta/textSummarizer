Dangal didn't apply for nominations at IIFA: Show organisers.
Cinelovers were shocked when Aamir Khan's Dangal did not make it to the list of the IIFA 2017 nominations. Dangal not only received rave reviews from critics, but also went on to become the highest grossing Indian film in cinematic history. Naturally, fans were shocked at the snub and expressed their disappointment on social media.However, the organisers have clarified that it was the makers of Dangal who did not send in an entry. Andre Timmins, the Director of Wizcraft International, told IANS, "So basically, in IIFA, forms are sent to various production houses. They fill those forms up and send it back to us. Those forms are then put out to the industry for voting and from there it becomes a nomination. Dangal has not sent their entry in."He added, "We would love Dangal to be a part of it. I think it's a movie that's broken all records. We love Aamir Khan and the two little girls. They did a great job. But unfortunately, they didn't send their entry in. We feel sad."The IIFA Awards were held at the MetLife Stadium in New York last week. While Neerja took home the award for Best Film, Aniruddha Roy Chowdhury won Best Director for his hard-hitting courtroom drama, Pink. Udta Punjab actors Shahid Kapoor and Alia Bhatt won the awards for Best Actor and Best Actress, respectively.
