TVF CEO Arunabh gets anticipatory bail in molestation case.
After playing hide and seek for long with the media, CEO of The Viral Fever online portal finally appeared before the Dindoshi Sessions Court. The court today granted an anticipatory bail to Kumar.The court heard Kumar's anticipatory bail application in the cases of sexual harassment filed against him by a former employee and another woman who alleged that he behaved inappropriately when she went to his office.Arunabh's lawyer Abad Ponda told the court that not only were these cases falsely registered against him but there were no merits in the cases which were registered more than an year after the alleged incidents. The prosecution also told the court that Kumar had been interrogated at least eight times since the cases were registered.Considering that Arunabh has been cooperating with police in their investigation, the court granted the anticipatory bail. About 10 days ago, the same court had granted interim relief to him. ARUNABH ASKED TO COOPERATE WITH THE PROBE Arunabh has been asked by court to appear before the investigators as and when called and to cooperate with the investigation. Immediately after the order Arunabh left the Dindoshi court premises.
