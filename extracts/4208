Don't lose faith, hum honge kamyab: Kejriwal to AAP cadre.
Aam Aadmi Party chief Arvind Kejriwal has written a letter to party workers, demoralised after the AAP's recent loses in Punjab and Goa Assembly elections. The party was especially betting big on Punjab, which sent four AAP leaders to the Lok Sabha in the 2014 general election. The party won 20 constituencies in Punjab, narrowly beating the Shiromani Akali Dal-Bhartiya Janata Party combine's 18 seats to emerge as the principal opposition in the state. In Goa, on the other hand, AAP failed to open its tally, losing in all the constituencies the party contested in. Delhi chief minister Kejriwal's morale-boosting letter, sent to all APP volunteers, comes just ahead of Delhi municipal polls, scheduled for April 22.ALSO READ | Congress to use Punjab Assembly elections results against AAP in MCD poll campaigns
