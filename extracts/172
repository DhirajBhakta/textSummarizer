Gurugram civic body puts free parking signs outside malls.
The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG), which earlier waived off property tax for several malls on the condition of providing free basement parking to city residents, has decided to put up free parking signboards at entry points of malls on MG Road.The move has come after MCG received complaints that malls continued to charge visitors for parking despite their commitment to provide the service for free.V Umashankar, MCG commissioner, said, In case people find mall managements violating the free parking commitments, they can lodge complaints instantly. We have issued instructions to mall managements in this regard.Visible display of free parking signboards will help people. Our purpose is to translate commitment of free parking into a reality for visitors, said Umashankar, adding that he is working on a plan to improve the Mall Mile at MG Road.Earlier, in March, the MCG had decided not to levy property tax on commercial spaces of malls and other office establishments if they provided free parking in their basements.Prominent among these establishments are DLF City Court shopping centre-cum-office, Grand Mall, Mega City Mall, Vipul Agora Mall and Solitaire Plaza Hotel on MG Road. Such establishments onSohna Road are JMD Megapolis, JMD Galleria and Ninex City Mart.The idea of free parking would help reduce parking hazards on the roads too. People will straightaway enter basements and will never like to park a car on the road. It is a win-win situation for all, said YS Gupta, additional municipal commissioner.Abhey Poonia, a Suncity resident, said, We appreciate the MCG for free parking arrangements in malls and offices. We wish every commercial establishment, including malls, used its basements for free parking. It would help resolve the parking problem to a great extent.
