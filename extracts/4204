Congress-led UPA made economy strong: President Mukherjee.
President Pranab Mukherjee may have just served a reminder to Prime Minister Narendra Modi about the economic growth rate. He also praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for being very observant.Delivering the special address at the India Today Conclave 2017 in Mumbai, President Mukherjee said, "Four of the five years during the UPA-I the growth rate was more than 8 per cent. The base of Indian economy was so strong that it sustained 2008 global economic crisis."He said that rate of investment was about 38 per cent of the GDP with sound rate of savings.Mukherjee emphasised that the various governments (led by Congress party) worked hard to streamline and strengthen the fundamentals of Indian economy.'INDIA WAS ASSERTIVE EARLIER ALSO'President Mukherjee seems to have served another reminder to PM Modi by referring to 'aggression' shown by Indira Gandhi during 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War."That was the highpoint of assertion and aggression. If that was not aggression, then what is aggression of Indian nation," Mukherjee asked.Indira Gandhi expressed India's concerns through 1971 assertion, Mukherjee underscored, adding that it was India's strong response that Pakistan was forced to declare unilateral ceasefire.PM Modi has been talking about surgical strike as the first real assertion by Indian state against the rogue behaviour of Pakistan.President Mukherjee reminded the nation of the contributions of first Prime Minister of India Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru for laying the foundation of democracy in India.MUKHERJEE PRAISED MODIShowering lavish praise on Narendra Modi, Mukherjee said that he has acquired mastery over external affairs, foreign economy."He is observant. I appreciate when he said that you can win election by majority but to rule you need consensus," Mukherjee said about Modi.He related a story about Atal Bihari Vajpayee when he requested Pranab Mukherjee not to be very harsh on the then George Fernandes, who was being attacked in Parliament over coffin scandal after Kargil war.Mukherjee served under four Prime Ministers as ministers beginning with Indira Gandhi and followed by Rajiv Gandhi, Narsimha Rao and Manmohan Singh.DISRUPTION IN PARLIAMENTPresident Mukherjee expressed concerns over continued disruption in Parliament."Enormous power is vested in members elected to Parliament and Legislative Assemblies. Their primary job to make laws," Mukherjee said.Talking about Anna Hazare's anti-graft movement, he said that agitation was a message that the Lok Sabha had failed in doing its primary duty of framing an anti-corruption law, a Lokpal law despite several committees recommending for it."In the first Lok Sabha during 1952-57, total 677 sittings of Parliament were held and 319 bills passed. But, in contrast the 15th Lok Sabha saw only 357 sittings and only 180 bills were passed because the disease of disruption has crept in," Mukherjee said."Disruption in Parliament and law making is unacceptable to me," President asserted adding, "In 15th Lok Sabha, as much as 46.1 per cent of allotted time was lost to disruption."A visibly upset President said Session after session lapsed without passing a law. Who will make law then, he asked. CAG report is presented to the Lok Sabha. Who will examine it, he wondered.The first annual Budget of India was of Rs 397 crore only while the today India's Budget stands at Rs 17 lakh crore, Mukherjee said.
