Shiv Sena promises vote to NDA's Presidential pick Kovind.
The National Democratic Alliance?s (NDA) presidential candidate Ram Nath Kovind visited Mumbai on Saturday for a brief campaign stop, ahead of Monday?s election. Kovind spoke to MPs and legislators from the BJP and its allies in the state, including Shiv Sena, at Churchgate?s Garware Club. Sena MPs and ministers attended the function, ending speculation about the party top brass being miffed over Kovind not meeting Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray during this visit. Kovind skipped the customary visit to the Thackeray residence ? current President Pranab Mukherjee and his predecessor Pratibha Patil had done so to seek support ? but called Thackeray to thank him for his party?s support. Thackeray confirmed this at a press conference later.
