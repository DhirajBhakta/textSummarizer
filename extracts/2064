Work on world?s largest Hindu temple to begin in 2017.
Work is set to start soon to build what could well be the world's largest Hindu temple -- in Bihar.Those behind the idea say no more hurdles are left for the construction to begin after Holi festival next year, now that the original plan was modified following objections from the Cambodian government."We modified our original plan after Cambodia raised objection to our Viraat Ramayan Mandir, saying it is a replica of Angkor Wat," said Acharya Kishore Kunal of the Patna-based Mahavir Mandir Trust."We are set to start work after Holi, which will be an auspicious time," he said.A former Indian Police Service officer, Kunal said the design or architecture of the proposed temple will have nothing to do with Angkor Wat, visited by millions every year.Also read: Cambodia's protest hinders Virat Ramayan Mandir construction in BiharThe Cambodian temple complex was built in the 12th century during king Suryavarman's rule and is now a Unesco World Heritage site.The proposed temple will come up over 165 acres at Janki Nagar near Kesaria in West Champaran district, about 150 km from Patna.

Kunal and his team then re-exmained their plan. The modified plan was sent to Phnom Penh last year and again early this year through the Ministry of External Affairs.The Cambodian embassy in New Delhi reportedly indicated that in case of any objection, it will suggest modifications. NO RESPONSE FROM CAMBODIAN EMBASSY"I have been informed by our government that there is no response from the Cambodian embassy," Kunal said. "So, a decision has been taken to start the construction work."He said the temple design has been influenced by over a dozen famous temples in India and abroad, particularly Thailand and Indonesia.
