Need battery-run cars and buses to check pollution: Kejriwal.
Battery-operated buses and cars could soon be a reality in the Capital with chief minister Arvind Kejriwal saying on Saturday that his government was exploring the idea.Addressing e-rickshaw drivers at an event organised by the government for the payment of subsidy to them, Kejriwal said there was a need to reduce the number of diesel and petrol-run vehicles to check pollution. ?We want more vehicles should run on battery and electricity so that the number of diesel and petrol vehicles could be reduced. At present, pollution is the biggest problem in Delhi,? he added. The government had flagged off one e-bus last year on a trial basis for six months. Talking about the e-rickshaw drivers whose number in the Capital has risen to over one lakh, the chief minister said they are doing a favour for the people of Delhi as their vehicles help fight pollution. The subsidy of Rs 15,000 and Rs 30,000 is intended to promote these eco-friendly three-wheelers mostly used by commuters for short distances or last mile connectivity. The Delhi government in its current financial year budget earmarked Rs 1.06 crore for providing subsidy to e-rickshaw owners. In total, around 6,000 applicants were given financial aid.To avail of the scheme, e-rickshaw drivers can submit the required documents to the transport department till July 22. Subsequently, the government will transfer the subsidy amount to their bank account by July 31.Last month, the transport department had made Aadhaar card details compulsory for those seeking subsidy on e-rickshaws registered in the city, in order to ?prevent duplicacy? in grant of the financial assistance.
