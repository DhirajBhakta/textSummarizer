Mulayam campaigns for Shivpal, seeks votes for Lok Dal.
The spring may have gone out of Mulayam Singh Yadav's step after he was unseated from the leadership of the Samajwadi Party by his son Akhilesh Yadav, but he still retains his ability to sting. Evidence of that came at the rally that he addressed this afternoon at Jaswantnagar in his home district of Etwah. He  came here asking for votes for his brother Shivpal Yadav but what was more interesting was his open support for a Lok Dal candidate from the Etwah seat.Mulayam rooting for the Lok Dal candidate is significant. The party exists mainly on paper and is distinct from the Rashtriya Lok Dal, which is headed by Ajit Singh. After Mulayam Singh Yadav was tossed out as the president of his party, he, along with Shivpal, toyed with the idea of taking over the Lok Dal, but ultimately decided against it.Speculation abounds in political circles that close to 40 of the duo's loyalists who were denied tickets by the SP are now contesting on the Lok Dal ticket. If a handful of them manage to win, they could strengthen Mulayam's hand in the event of a hung Assembly.Also read: Samajwadi feud: Mulayam-Akhilesh fight leaves Shivpal supporters in limboYADAV CLAN ABSENT AT SHIVPAL RALLYAlthough Etwah happens to be the family bastion of the Yadav family, not one member of the larger Yadav clan has been out seeking votes for Shivpal. Conspicuous by their absence from today's rally were the chief minister and MPs Ram Gopal Yadav, Dimple Yadav, Dharmendar Yyadav, Tej Pratap Yadav and Akshay Yadav.A significant feature of Shivpal's campaign and today's rally was that votes were sought in the name of Mulayam Singh Yadav and the development work that has taken place in the district during his time as chief minister and by Shivpal as the state irrigation and PWD minister. No mention was made of Akhilesh Yadav or any of that development work done by his government.
