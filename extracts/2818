Nestle, Reliance milk products contaminated, claims Minister.
Tamil Nadu Milk and Dairy Products Developments Minister Rajendra Balaji once again stirred a controversy by alleging that the products of private milk producers are adulterated. In a press briefing at his home today, Rajendra Balaji held two packets of milk products - one by Nestle and the other, a product of Reliance and affirmed that he had laboratory results which shows they are contaminated.The dairy minister alleged there are contents of caustic soda and bleaching powder in the milk products. Balaji was not worried about the health secretary's earlier report to the court claiming that no such adulterants were discovered. He stated that he has with him laboratory results, which prove his claim. "The samples were tested in Pune to see if the firms were following the Centre's food regulation norms," Balaji said.The minister also stated that he came under pressure when he took his stance and he had to fight many hurdles. A verbal spat ensued between Balaji and former education minister Vaigai Selvan over the ordeal wherein the dairy minister Selvan "someone who will speak anything if you give him a mere Rs 500 rupees". Selvan retaliated by stating that it was AIADMK which pushed Balaji from rags to riches and hence, he should not apeak against a party member in such a manner.
