Government denies any plan to build wall between India, Pak.
Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) told Parliament that there was no proposal with the Central government to build a wall along Pakistan border. This was stated by Minister of State (MoS) for Home Kiren Rijiju in a response to an unstarred question by Rajya Sabha MP Harivansh.Internationally, "the wall" is a term often used by United States President Donald Trump while referring to the physical barrier his government aims to build along the border with Mexico. According to reports, after Home Minister Rajnath Singh's visit to Israel, the MHA was planning to build a "strong wall" along the India-Pakistan border to check terrorist infiltration. It was learnt that the Ministry of Home Affairs was keen to build a wall similar to the Israeli West Bank wall with Palestine. However, the Home Ministry informed the upper house that the Narendra Modi government is not considering any such proposal. HI-TECH PLANS TO BOOST SECURITY The government instead has adopted a multi-pronged approach for enhancing security arrangement at the India-Pakistan border. This includes deployment of Border Security Force (BSF), construction of border fence and border roads, installation of floodlights and construction of border outposts (BOPs), introduction of hi-tech surveillance equipment and providing weapons and specialised vehicles to security forces.In another statement, MHA informed Parliament that approximately 250 km of India-Pakistan border has not been covered under fencing primarily due to riverines, ditches and marshy terrain, and in some cases due to pending land acquisition.The MHA said India has sanctioned a pilot project for deployment of technological solutions and force multipliers, physical patrolling, laying of concertina wires, laser infra-red system, among several other measures along the border.
