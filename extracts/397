JNU students should take oath to protect nationalism: BJP MP.
New Delhi, Jul 27 (PTI) The students of JNU must take an oath of protecting the shine of Indias pride and nationality, a BJP MP said today while supporting a demand by the Vice Chancellor to install a battle tank inside the campus. Meenakshi Lekhi, raising the issue during zero hour in the Lok Sabha, also criticised attempts to create a "controversy" following the call by the Jawaharlal Nehru University vice chancellor Jagadesh Kumar to install the tank. She said "anti-India" slogans like India will be broken were raised inside the campus and such activities cannot be allowed to continue. "It is very unfortunate. A controversy is being created following the vice chancellors views. The JNU is run by tax- payers money. Anti-India slogans were raised inside the campus. It is an insult of those protecting the border," Lekhi said. The BJP MP from Delhi said the JNU students should take an oath that they will protect the countrys pride and nationality. Justifying the JNU vice chancellors demand, she said replica of aircraft were installed at various places including schools and students find them very interesting. "There was an aircraft in my sons school. It was encouraging for the students. There is nothing wrong in the VCs demand," she said.
