Hrithik wanted industry people to sabotage my career: Ranaut.
Hrithik Roshan and Kangana Ranaut have cemented a place for themselves in the Wall of Fame for having one of the most ugly spats in the history of Bollywood. A subtle insult ("silly ex") snowballed into a full-blown mudslinging match, where legal notices were exchanged, private emails were made public and accusations were made.ALSO READ | Kangana on spat with Hrithik: I was threatened, my parents were concerned about my safetyALSO READ | Timeline of the Hrithik-Kangana legal warALSO READ | Rakesh Roshan breaks silence on Hrithik-Kangana fight, says truth will shock everyoneWhile Hrithik has maintained a dignified silence, Kangana has been vocal since day one, insisting that Hrithik was in a romantic relationship with her "behind closed doors." In an interview with Firstpost, Kangana said that even though a private affair between two people was made public, no third person could "help that situation." She revealed, "there were instances when he (Hrithik) was going and crying to the entire industry, wanting them to sabotage my career, and people were calling me and saying - 'He met us, he has showed us proofs and (do you) want to meet us because we want to know your side of the story as well?'  But I was like, it is none of your business."The Rangoon actor had earlier said that she was threatened and her parents were concerned for her safety. She elaborated, "The threats were quite open, weren't they? They said they would release some statements, they would reveal something, say something... 'We will expose her and everyone will be shocked'... something along those lines... It is not that I knew this sort of game plan that would be unleashed against me. So I thought there would be some reveal but there was none and obviously those were just threats."
