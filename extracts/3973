China to launch 156 minisatellites for better internet.
From K J M Varma Beijing, Mar 31 (PTI) China will launch a network of 156 mini-satellites to facilitate global broadband coverage as part of the countrys effort to give a wider push for commercial space development. This is the first low orbiting, networked satellite project, which will orbit 1,000 km above the ground, state-owned China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation (CASIC) said. "The network is a general satellite platform," said Bei Chao, a CASIC engineer. Small satellites are easy to mass produce and upgrade at low cost. The project is part of Chinas effort to give wider push to commercial space development. Low orbit helps avoid signal delay and satellite communication services with frequencies from 26.5 to 40 hertz improve Internet access.
