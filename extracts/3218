Saif's daughter Sara to make acting debut opposite Sushant.
Speculations were rife about what Saif Ali Khan's daughter Sara Ali Khan's debut project would be.At various times, she was attached to Karan Johar's Student of the Year 2 and at one time with a film opposite Hrithik Roshan. The list also included a possible Abhishek Kapoor project starring Sushant Singh Rajput.Now, Abhishek Kapoor himself has confirmed exclusively to India Today that Sara Ali Khan will indeed be making her Bollywood debut opposite Sushant Singh Rajput in a film called Kedarnath.Earlier, in an interview to Mumbai Mirror, Saif Ali Khan had said that even though she understands his daughter Sara's willingness to join the profession, he is also worried."Who's to blame, it's in her genes. I remember on the first world tour we were on together, I spotted her peeking through the curtains backstage to watch the actors dancing on stage, mesmerised. That's when she decided this is what she wanted to do. Cinema has changed since and she's also realised there's a lot of angst in the profession, specially if you have not quite arrived yet. I worry about that, but what can I do?," Saif said.
