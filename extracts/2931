ICC mulls scrapping Champions Trophy for an extra World T20.
International Cricket Council (ICC) chief executive David Richardson has revealed that Champions Trophy  could be scrapped to make way for the World T20 every two years.India slumped to a crushing 180-run defeat at the hands of their arch-rivals Pakistan  at the Kennington Oval on Sunday, with an estimated viewing audience in hundreds of millions.However, some officials argued that the recently-concluded eight-team marquee event is too similar to the World Cup, which the ICC has decided will be contested with just 10 teams from 2019 in England.And Richardson admitted that there should be some differentiation in global events and, therefore, the 2021 Champions Trophy, scheduled to be held in India, is not guaranteed to go ahead, the Dawn reported."What we want to do is differentiate our global events from each other so that they can be standalone and create maximum interest every time the event happens," Richardson told reporters via telephonic conversation on the eve of the ICC's annual conference in London."At this stage, the next Champions Trophy is still scheduled for India in 2021. Whether that gets changed, the consideration has been given to changing to two T20s in a four-year cycle which would mean swapping the Champions Trophy for a World T20," he added.Richardson believes that World T20s attract a lot more attention than ODI tournaments and also generate significant revenue for the television companies.He further insisted that the idea is to give opportunities to more teams, hinting at the possibility of 20 teams featuring in World T20s in future.
