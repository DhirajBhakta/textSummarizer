Andhra capital will be bigger, better than Hyderabad: CM.
Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu today said he will build a "bigger, better city" in Amaravati than Hyderabad when the latter becomes the capital of Telangana in 2024. "I will build a bigger, better city than Hyderabad. Amaravati, the Andhra capital, will be the best city in India," Naidu told Consulting Editor Rajdeep Sardesai at the India Today South Conclave in Chennai. When Telangana was formed in 2014, it was decided that Hyderabad will remain the shared capital between the two states till 2024. "A water grid, world class capital city Amaravati and human resource development are the three top priorities of my government. Rest all will fall in place," he said. "People should remember me forever. I will make an Andhra Pradesh model," the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) chief said at the session titled 'The Great Digital Leap'.ON DEMONETISATIONMaking a U-turn, Naidu today said demonetisation was good for the country. The BJP ally at the Centre had earlier questioned the move to ban Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes, saying he did not know if there is a solution to the cash crisis.
