Demonetisation has not affected me: Aamir Khan.
Superstar Aamir Khan has remained unscathed by demonetisation because he does not happen to have any black money. The actor recently spoke his mind on Prime Minister Narendra Modi's initiative at an event."I wont lie, I will be honest... demonetisation didn't affect my life much. I believe it affected those people who have black money... I don't have any black money... I have been paying my taxes till date. So I don't have any black money at all," Aamir Khan said at an event in Mumbai.ALSO READ | Focus on national interest, ignore short-term effect of demonetisation, says Aamir KhanALSO READ | Prime Minister Narendra Modi's demonetisation move claims 25 lives in a weekOPINION | Here's why Shah Rukh, Salman, Aamir supporting demonetisation is laughableAamir added that he spends only using credit card and cheque and therefore, lacking cash on account of demonetisation doesn't really affect him much."I know many people had problems and I feel sad for them but I am also happy that our Prime Minister has taken an initiative, so we should support him," Aamir said.Earlier in November, while launching Dangal's first single Haanikaarak Bapu in Mumbai, Aamir said that people should focus on the long-term impact of demonetisation for national interest and ignore short-term hiccups.On that note, since November 8 when Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced his demonetisation move, 25 people died all over the country for being unable to obtain cash from banks or ATMs for basic day-to-day activities. In media, up to 55 deaths were linked with PM Modi's demonetisation move in the first ten days.
