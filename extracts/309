RSS-backed group sings rap song targeting Goa CM Parrikar.
RJ Malishkas Sonu song, a viral video that mocks Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) over pot-holed roads, has inspired a political outfit in Goa. The Goa Suraksha Manch (GSM), which is backed by state Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Subhash Velingkar, has used a similar sing-song routine to question chief minister Manohar Parrikar over his purported support to the casino lobby and failure of governance.The video Mannu Aamka Tuzyawar Bharosa Nai Hai, which has gone viral, features workers of the organisation questioning Mannu (Manohar Parrikar) backing the casino industry.Mannu we do not trust you, Mannu is your humanity no more, You are a protector of casinos, You are a destroyer of Goa, says the video. The manch, has been critical of Parrikars functioning and policies in the past as well.The song is in protest of a new casino-housing vessel, promoted by Haryana politician Gopal Kanda, which beached at the Miramar beach near Panaji a few days ago. It has been a subject of controversy, especially in the Goa legislative assembly, during the ongoing monsoon session.Parrikar, who as opposition leader, had led a seven-year campaign against the casino industry, is now accused by the Congress of going back on his words to ban casinos from Goas rivers.We had thought that he would move casinos from the Mandovi. Goas educated society does not want casinos at all. He does not bother or love Goan culture. This song should remind people about all failed promises and political treachery by Parrikar, Goa Suraksha Manch spokersperson Anand Shirodkar said on Wednesday.A few days ago, Red FM and comedian José Covaco had released videos slamming the BMC and supporting RJMalishka.Inputs from IANS
