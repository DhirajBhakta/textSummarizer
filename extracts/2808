Jinder Mahal to fight Randy Orton in Punjabi Prison match.
Jinder Mahal and Randy Orton will face each other for the WWE Championship belt on SmackDown pay-per-view, WWE Battleground, in Philadelphia on July 23 in a Punjabi Prison match, as SmackDown Live commissioner Shane McMahon announced on this week's episode. The 'Modern Day Maharaja' will be defending his title for the second time after successfully defeating the 'Viper'  at Money in the Bank, and as Champion got to decide the match stipulations."The name WWE Battleground is very fitting, because...it will be you and me locked in a Punjabi Prison match," he said.Up until now, there have been two Punjabi Prison matches in the history of the WWE and was introduced by The Great Khali. The Punjabi Prison match, very much like a steel cage match at Hell in a Cell or Elimination Chamber, is where two or more Superstars are locked inside to battle it out for supremacy without outside intervention.The difference being that there is a cage made of bamboo which is again surrounded by another octagonal bamboo structure while being  topped with a series of razor-sharp bamboo spikes.You have to escape not one, but TWO dangerous structures in a #PunjabiPrison match! #SDLivepic.twitter.com/KI6pbvj1Ij
