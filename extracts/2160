Bakery serving chocolate replicas of old ?500, ?1000 notes.
Dessert lovers in Kolkata are in for a treat after old currency notes went on a retreat post Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the demonetisation drive on November 8. Stacks of scrapped Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes are being used for various purposes. While some are making stationary like calendars, paper weights, files and boards, some are planning to use it in construction of roads. Letting the imagination run wild is what it depends on. In the past, according to various reports, people have even used them as toilet paper while some used them to serve 'chana garam/bhel puri'.IT HAPPENS ONLY IN KOLKATAOld notes are now etched in sugar and chocolate forever, all thanks to a Kolkata-based bakery's creative twist to the demonetisation move.The bakery has come out with dark chocolate replicas, made using scrapped notes and each thin slice of the chocolate is priced at Rs 100. "The base is chocolate and the layout of the notes is painted with edible sugar paint. They were introduced right after demonetisation was announced," an official of Krazy for Chocolates, a bakery specialising in chocolates, pastries, customised cakes among others, said.At its outlets across numerous city malls, salespersons have been assailed with questions over its edibility."Some people give it a second look because they think it's incredible. It has raised a lot of eyebrows and the curiosity is good for business," a salesperson manning a counter at City Centre 2 mall, said.
