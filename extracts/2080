Those disrupting Parliament should be suspended: Tharoor.
Thiruvananthapuram, Dec 12 (PTI) Congress MP and former Union minister Shashi Tharoor today took exception to continued disruption of Parliament and said those disrupting the House should be suspended automatically. "I do not think people have sent me to disrupt the House. However, the culture of Indian politics since independence, has sadly taken this shape," he told a meet the press programme here. "I have not changed my views on this and my party also know this. Debate and discussion should be held in Parliament and not disruption," the former UN diplomat said. He was reacting on stalling of the House by Opposition over the demonetisation issue. Tharoor said an all-party consensus should be arrived at to see that any member who disrupted the House got automatic suspension. "This can be done only when all political parties agree to it," he said. The Congress leader also hit out at BJP and said the party had disrupted the House, when it was in opposition and had now become "high advocates of Parliament proceedings." "Disruption of Parliament has become a vicious circle", he said. To a question on the Manmohan Singh-led UPA governments alleged involvement in the AgustaWestland scam, Tharoor said nobody would believe that former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh would commit a mistake. "Manmohan Singh is a man with strict financial integrity. I do not think that he will do any financial mistake," he said.
