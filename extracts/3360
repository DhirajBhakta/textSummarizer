Topic is redundant: Madhuri on rumoured ex-boyfriend Dutt .
It is a known fact that Madhuri Dixit was dating Sanjay Dutt back in the early 90s. But as soon as Dutt was arrested in 1993 Bombay blasts, Madhuri started to maintain her distance, and as they say, rest is history. But decades later, filmmaker Rajkumar Hirani has decided to bring Sanju baba's life on 70mm. And if reports are to be believed, Madhuri's existence in his life has been carefully cropped in the biopic. There were rumours a few months ago that Dhak Dhak girl had requested Hirani to chop off her part. However, in an interview to Mid-Day, Madhuri rubbished the rumours and said, "For where I am today, this [the topic of Dutt] has become redundant. Life has come a long way since then. I don't know where these reports are coming from. In any case, it doesn't make a difference to me."There were reports that Karisma Tanna was supposed to essay the role of Madhuri in the biopic. However, it was later revealed that Sonam Kapoor's character will be an amalgamation of Dutt's love interests in the early 90s. Ranbir Kapoor has stepped into the shoes of Sanjay Dutt for the biopic. Tentatively titled Dutt, the film will focus on Sanjay's formative years, his relation with his father Sunil Dutt, his struggles coping up with the loss of his mother, his many affairs, etc.
