Who is BJP to give sanctity to Muslims, asks Owaisi.
A day after Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad's "sanctity for Muslims" comment created a stir, AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi reacted saying it's a minister's duty to ensure justice and equality. "Is the minister (Ravishankar Prasad) trying to patronise or threaten us Yes we didn't vote for you and will continue to do so...but it's your constitutional duty to ensure justice and equality as you have taken oath of constitution," the Hyderabad MP said."Who is the minister to say BJP gave us sanctity it is the constitution who gave sanctity. Government and parties will come and go but constitution will remain as it is supreme," he added.Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad was speaking at the Mindmine Summit in Delhi where he said, "We have got 13 chief ministers of our own. We are ruling the country. Have we victimised any Muslim gentleman working in the industry or service Have we dismissed them We don't get Muslim votes. I acknowledge very clearly, but have we given them proper sanctity or not"
