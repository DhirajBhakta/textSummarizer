Mohalla clinic report showing blood sugar at 9500 goes viral.
A six-month-old medical report from a mohalla clinic in Delhi showing an abnormally high blood sugar level of 9,481.7 mg/dl for a patient, has gone viral on social media.The normal level is usually less than 140 mg/dl, post meals.The AAP government, which runs the clinics, has however dismissed the report as forged, saying such messages are being spread to discredit the mohalla clinic system.The HbA1c test result, which measures the average blood glucose level over a period of time, shows the glucose levels of the patient are 332%, whereas a healthy person should have below 6%.This report resurfaced on Twitter on Friday, days after Delhis vigilance team started investigation into mohalla clinic doctors, calling patients for unnecessary follow-ups.Twitterati went berserk with comments, blaming doctors and the labs for botched tests and treatment.OMG!!! This is shocking. (Arvind)Kejriwal ji PM ki degree ko chodo, zara mohalla clinics ke doctors ke bhi degree check karo (Kejriwal, forget the PMs degree, check the degrees of the doctors of mohalla clinics), read a tweet from the account of Pune-based Dr Majboor Gulati.Delhi governments health department officials, however, said that the report is most likely a fake one as there have been cases of forging reports in the past.I have not seen the report. However, a similar report had been doing the rounds on social media last year and we found that it had been forged using stationery from the labs, an official said, adding that labs have been asked to be careful about their stationery.Noting that the mohalla clinic system, which provides consultation, medicine and tests, has benefitted several people, the official said these messages are being spread to discredit the system.He also said that even if such a report a came from their labs, there is a doctor to check it. And, the doctor would never treat based on such a test report they would resend the samples.Last year, BJP MLA Vijender Gupta had questioned the quality of healthcare provided at mohalla clinics, citing the example of a pregnant woman who was diagnosed with thalassemia at one clinic and the report was allegedly incorrect according to a private lab.A D-10 haemoglobin electrophoresis by Bio-Rad, the accepted golden standard test, was performed for the woman and she was found to be carrying thalassemia trait, an official had informed HT.Carrying the trait does not mean that a person is suffering from thalassemia, but, if the husband also carries the gene, there are 25% chances that the baby suffers from the genetic blood defect, the official explained.
