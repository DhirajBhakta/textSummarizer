Dubai launches world's fastest free airport Wi-Fi.
Dubai, Mar 19 (PTI) Dubai Airports has announced worlds fastest free Wi-Fi service across its terminals to provide millions of passengers superfast internet access while they wait for their flight. Aptly called WOW-Fi, the service offers a top speed of up to 100 megabits per second (mbps), about ten times faster than what many internet users would get at home in the UAE. The service provides internet connection surpassing all other airports, according to a statement released here by Dubai Airports. The launch of the service follows Dubai Airports launch of an upgraded free unlimited high-speed Wi-Fi connection across Dubai International (DXB) and Dubai World Central (DWC) in December last year. The unlimited free Wi-Fi at DXB connects with just one click and offers speed that sets a new benchmark for airports globally.
