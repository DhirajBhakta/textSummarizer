Do not raise 'Narendra Modi Murdabad' slogans: Rahul Gandhi.
At a rally in poll-bound Uttar Pradesh today, Rahul Gandhi stopped people from hurling invective against Narendra Modi, saying he is the Prime Minister and "we must not say 'murdabad' (down with) for anyone".As Gandhi began his speech at the public rally in Jaunpur, some people from among the crowd started shouting slogans against Modi over demonetisation.Gandhi asked them not to do that. "We have differences of opinion with Modi and the BJP. Do not use the word 'murdabad'... Narendra Modi is the Prime Minister. Political fight is there," he said."That is for the RSS people to say, not for us," the 46-year-old leader said. The RSS (or Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh) is the ideological mentor of the BJP.'MODI TOOK BLOOD OF 99% INDIANS OUT' The Congress vice-president said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has taken blood out of the veins of 99 per cent Indians with its demonetisation decision. He said the Congress would have assisted any move of the government to weed out corruption and black money from India but "the decision on demonetisation was neither against corruption, nor against black money".He said: "We want to root out corruption from India. If the government takes any decisions against corruption, we will support it 100 per cent."
