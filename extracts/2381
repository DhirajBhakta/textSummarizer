Most importantly, he will talk to people and sensitise them about environmental issues, cleanliness and garbage disposal,? Dr Khan said.Talking about his new post, Dar said, ?I am very happy. I will go around as the brand ambassador and tell people that if we keep our surroundings clean and follow garbage disposal mechanism, it will benefit all.?
