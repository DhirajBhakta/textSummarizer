They shouted but nobody from the hospital administration paid attention to them. I had come to attend my relative. I jumped upon the gate and shooed the dogs away, said Tikam Sharma, a resident of Indore.Other visitors who witnessed the scene said despite repeated attempts to contact the hospital superintendent, VS Paul, the latter neither answered the call nor came to the hospital. .Indore Sanyogitaganj police station in-charge Manju Yadav said, In the preliminary investigation, it was found that the body was of a newborn, who died after just after his birth. The body was kept carelessly in the mortuary from where it dragged by the dog. The body was sent for post mortem and things will be more clear after the report comes.
