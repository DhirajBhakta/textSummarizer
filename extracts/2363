						The 30-year-old actor recalled talking to his director Miguel Sapochnik that the Lord Commander of the Nights Watch secretly thrives when he is on a war front, according to The Hollywood Reporter. I actually think secretly deep down, hes a bit of a psychopath, weirdly. He looks for violence. In a strange way, and I said this to (Sapochnik) during Battle of the Bastards, I think that in a weird way this could be Jons natural home, on this battlefield, where he comes to life. For all of his good, hes a violent man, says Harington.The actor adds Jons character does not have much to do with happiness.I think happiness is a very strange term to associate with Jon. He has a very odd sense of what happy is. It might not be everybody elses happy. I dont know what happiness is for Jon, he says. Follow @htshowbiz for more
