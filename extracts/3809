Hema Malini drinks daily, does she commit suicide, asks MLA.
Farmers' suicide is a big political issue in Maharashtra, but dragging the 'dreamgirl of Bollywood' into the row is something what the BJP Lok Sabha MP won't like.This is what happened when Maharashtra Independent MLA Bacchu Kadu courted controversy after he dragged Hema Malini into a row over farmers' suicides."Hema Malini drinks everyday, but does she commit suicide" Kadu said addressing a press conference in Nanded district.Kadu, who is not new to making controversial statements, while countering the general claims that farmers commit suicide because of their drinking habits said, "75 per cent MLAs, MPs, journalists drink... even Hema Malini drinks heavily... but have they committed suicide" he asked.The MLA, who represents Achalpur (Amravati) constituency, didn't even spare Union Road and Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari. "The expenditure of Gadkari's son's wedding was around Rs 4 crore, should we wait for him to commit suicide" DNA quoted Kadu, as saying .Last year, Kadu was arrested for allegedly assaulting a government officer at the Mantralaya.BJP FURIOUS OVER KADU'S REMARKThe MLA's comments haven't gone down well with the BJP. Party leaders said that Kadu's statements don't just defame Hema Malini, but every women."Malini is a well-known figure across the globe, apart from being a member of Parliament. These statements are uncalled for. Farmers commit suicide not just because of bad crops. There are various reasons behind it," Priti Gandhi, national executive member of BJP's Mahila Morcha, said.According to reports, over 200 farmers have committed suicide only in the Marathwada region of Maharashtra in the first three months of 2017.
