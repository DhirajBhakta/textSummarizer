Sonu shaved his head as he wanted to get rid of lice: Maulvi.
Sonu Nigam and Kolkata cleric Syed Sha Atef Ali Al Quaderi appear to be in no mood to put an end to the ongoing ugly spat between them. Hours after the Bollywood singer 'accepted' the challenge from the Muslim cleric to shave his head, Quaderi said Sonu Nigam probably wanted to get rid of lice."Sonu Nigam wanted to get rid of lice...and wanted to escape the summer heat, so got his head shaved. He has completed on a part of my challenge. Two conditions remain to be accepted," Quaderi told reporters during a press conference in Kolkata.The Muslim cleric, who was flanked by Kalighat Temple priest and Keshav Chatterjee and Father S. Chatterjee during the press conference, said Sonu Nigam should leave India if he has issues with azaan and mandir ka ghanta. "If he wants to stay in India, he will have to follow the norms of the land. He must tolerate azaan and mandir ka ghanta alike," Quaderi said, adding," Sonu Nigam must complete the remaining two challenges - wear a garland of old torn shoes and a tour around the country - to win the Rs 10 lakh prize money that I had announced." 'I SALUTE MODI' Citing an instant when Prime Minister Narendra Modi stopped his speech midway for azaan, the Kolkata cleric said one should learn from the prime minister. "I salute PM Modi. He stopped speaking as soon as azaan was heard from a nearby mosque and waited till it got over. Both PM Modi and Mamata Bannerjee respect the Constitution of the country and know how to show respect to every religion," he added.Canvassing for West Bengal Assembly elections 2016, PM Narendra Modi had stopped his speech midway after hearing azaan in West Midnapore district. "Excuse me, azaan was on. Because of me, there should not be any problem to anyone's worshiping, so I paused for a few minutes," PM Modi said, before resuming his speech.
