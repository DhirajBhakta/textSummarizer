30-foot-long whale found dead on Odisha beach.
Morning walkers on the beach of temple town Puri were in for a shock on Monday when they discovered the body of a dead whale that had been swept ashore by the waves.The 30-feet-long carcass was seen lying on the beach near the Pantha Niwas. Locals suspect that the whale may have died after being hit by a vessel in deep sea. Later, forest officials reached the spot to recover the carcass. The carcass resulted in a foul smell that spread across the area and a crane was brought in to lift the dead whale away.This is the second such incident in less than two months on the Puri beach. Earlier in February, another such whale carcass was found at Puri's Balukhanda beach.Last year, in December another 42-foot-long whale carcass was recovered from the Baidhara Pentha beach in Puri.Scientists are worried about the trend given the sudden rise in the number of such mammals being killed. Forest department officials have sent the body for post-mortem to ascertain the exact reason for the deaths.(With inputs from Mohd Suffian)A 32-feet-long whale carcass found on Odisha's Puri beach near Panthanivas earlier today.
