Uber CEO announces scholarship for baby named 'Uber'.
Do you remember Uber? No, not the cab but the baby boy who was named after the cab company Uber. The big daddy, Uber CEO Travis Kalanick met the baby and announced a scholarship fund of USD 12,000, approximately Rs 8.14 lakh, for the baby's higher education. Uber India President Amit Jain attended the birthday celebration Uber hosted for the baby. The baby was accompanied by his mother, father, grandparents and cousins for an intimate celebration. The money announced as scholarship is meant for his higher education when he turns 18 years of age. Travis also gifted the baby a bunny stuff toy, very similar to what he had as a child. "We are poor people and to be rewarded with scholarship is a blessing. To get Rs 8 lakh for his education is huge. They also hosted a private party in a 5 star hotel, we are overwhelmed" said Babli, Uber's mother.Last December, Babli hired an Uber after repeated calls to arrange an ambulance went unanswered. On her way to the hospital, Babli gave birth to her second child in the Uber cab. The blessing in disguise was the driver, Shahnawaz Khan, who extended all the help. On December 9, 2015, Khan received a request in the evening from Babli's husband to take his wife to a hospital. At that time he did not know that his passenger was in labour pain. Even after refusing he reached to pick her from the location and picked her along with two other women.Post-delivery, the cab driver Shahnawaz Khan jokingly suggested that the baby could be named after the cab company, and this, Babli took rather seriously.
