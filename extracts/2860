Lynching not new, it's being overhyped: Union Home Secretary.
Post the lynching of Deputy SP Mohammed Ayub Pandith in Kashmir, certain sections of public and some politicians have raised concerns about the situation in the Valley turning from bad to worse. However, Union Home Secretary believes lynching incidents are over-hyped and do not deserve the kind of attention they have received.While speaking in Jaipur, Rajiv Mehrishi, the Union Home Secretary, stated, "I don't think it (hate crime) is new in India. It is feudal in nature. Today, they shake the conscience. You cannot say lynching or hate crimes are something new. I think they are over hyped and over reported."Deputy SP Pandith was lynched to death near Jamia Masjid in Nowhatta area in Srinagar. Pandith reportedly had, fearing for his life, opened fire at an enraged mob. He was beaten to death after some people believed he was an informer after he was seen clicking pictures at the mosque. The incident, that of a police officer being lynched by civilians, is being considered unprecedented in Kashmir. While condemning the incident as regretful, the Union Home Secretary claimed it won't change the entire complexity of the Kashmir situation.He also said that an entire paradigm shift in policing is needed to drastically improve the situation in the country.
