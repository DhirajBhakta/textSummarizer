I toed and froed. I had days where I thought, right, Im definitely applying for it, Im going to have a crack and see how far I get. Other days where I wasnt so sure. In the end I just felt I wasnt quite ready for that opportunity. I think it would have been a wonderful job and I congratulate Ravi Shastri on getting that job.

If its a local guy, its a local guy. If its an international, then so be it. You certainly dont want to get up in the politics of all that. All you can do as a coach is present your case on how you think you can make a difference and help the team perform better, he said.If youre the best man for the job, then you should get offered that opportunity. Speaking as a coach, you only want to be judged on whether you think you can make a difference and help the side, and thats how it should be. Well have to wait and see on what jobs come up in the future, Gillespie concluded.
