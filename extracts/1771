"There is no other way. Supreme Court is the apex court of the country. We have to accept the verdict," he said.However, Mathew said that former cricketers would not necessarily make good administrators. Former India captain Sourav Ganguly is the front-runner to take over as the new president after the elections are held. "There are former cricketers who are eligible. Just one cricketer cannot be a good administrators. There are proven cases in other bodies where players have not necessarily been good administrators."This decision has come hours after the Supreme Court cracked the whip on a defiant Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) for not complying with its orders to implement the Lodha Committee report. The court sacked its President Anurag Thakur and Secretary Ajay Shirke. (RM Lodha hails victory for cricket as Supreme Court sacks BCCI president Anurag Thakur)
