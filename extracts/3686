Only 1 actress supported me: Abhay on fairness cream post.
Abhay Deol shocked everyone when he took on the who's who of Bollywood and slammed them for promoting racism through their fairness cream endorsements. From Shah Rukh Khan to Deepika Padukone, Vidya Balan to Shahid Kapoor, Sidharth Malhotra to Sonam Kapoor, Abhay spared no one. The actor finally opened up in an interview about the posts that made everyone sit up and take notice.Talking to Outlook, Abhay said, "This may be my first such post on Facebook, but I have tweeted about the issue in the past. I have been making an effort in my own space... Honestly, I was just expressing my views - I did it for awareness, though with a bit of fun... The FB post was a little provocative, to make people think."He added, "My appeal is to those in high positions, who have power and lead very comfortable lives. It is not to a struggling actor who is new on the scene, and for whom endorsement of a product (s)he doesn't perhaps believe in fetches money. There should be a tacit code or understanding among privileged people not to endorse things that give others an inferiority complex."Abhay's posts targetted some of the most powerful names in Bollywood, but he did get some support for his cause. The Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara actor said, "I received a lot of support from people and media. From corporates and filmmakers, no. Why would they? I am calling them out for their practices. No one wants to rock one's own boat. I got one call from an actress saying I am doing the right thing, that's it."
