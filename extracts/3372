No special prosecutor needed on Russia scandal: White House.
Washington, May 11 (PTI) The White House has ruled out the appointment of a special prosecutor to investigate the allegations of Russian interference in last years general elections. "We dont think its necessary. Youve got a House committee, a Senate committee and Department of Justice all working on this," White House Principal Deputy Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters. Sanders said Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein has strong bipartisan support and is "independent enough" to carry out the investigation. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump yesterday met Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe to discuss the situation and morale at the agency after the firing of the James Comey a day earlier. The White House also issued a timeline claiming how Trump lost confidence in Comey over the course of the last several months. "After watching Director Comeys testimony last Wednesday (at Capitol Hill), the President was strongly inclined to remove him."
