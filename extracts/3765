Udta Punjab wasn't made with aim to win National award: Alia.
Mumbai, Apr 16 (PTI) Actress Alia Bhatt, who played the role of a Bihari migrant in "Udta Punjab", said the film was not made with the intention of winning a National award. Abhishek Chaubeys "Udta Punjab", which dealt with the issue of substance abuse in Punjab, failed to win an award in the 64th National Film Awards. When asked how she felt on the film not getting recognition at the National awards, Alia said she did not feel bad, as the film had already been well received by the audience. "When the film released, it got that appreciation and recognition from the people. Its not that National awards are not prestigious, but it doesnt take away the fact whatever the film has achieved. "We did not make a film for that purpose, so its ok. An award is given when your efforts are rewarded. So, the people who have won, have put in more efforts and have been rewarded, so you shouldnt feel spiteful to somebodys elses win. Thats the wrong way of looking at it," Alia told reporters here. She was speaking on the sidelines of International Indian Film Academy (IIFA) awards press meet of voting weekend. "Udta Punjab" also had Shahid Kapoor, Kareena Kapoor and Diljit Dosanjh were in key roles. Alia, who made her acting debut with Karan Johars "Student of the Year", has delivered great performances in films like "Highway", "2 States", "Udta Punjab", "Dear Zindagi", doesnt feel a sense of fulfilment yet in her career. Alia says there is still a lot for her to achieve.
