Proud of my relationship and the person I'm with: Taapsee.
Taapsee Pannu is one of the rare Bollywood actors who has mostly steered clear of link-ups with her co-stars. However, sometime back, there were rumours that she was dating Olympic silver medallist badminton player Mathias Boe, who hails from Denmark. In an exclusive interview with IndiaToday.in, Taapsee opened up about her relationship.While she did not confirm that Mathias was the man in her life, she said, "I'm in an extremely good state in my personal life. Now, why I don't talk about it in the media is not because I'm ashamed to accept it, but because if I do, then everything will be centred around that and people will start talking about that more than the work I do, which I don't want. That is the only reason I don't want to talk about it. Otherwise, I'm extremely proud of my relationship status and the person I'm with."Coincidentally, Mathias is currently in the Indian capital for the India Super Series. Taapsee was in Delhi yesterday with her Naam Shabana co-star Akshay Kumar for the promotions of their upcoming film.A bit of shopping with @ViktorAxelsen at khan market, love the weather, ð®ð³ðð. pic.twitter.com/75ajdWthNTOn our favourite song, in our favourite city for the favourite film of this season #NaamShabanapic.twitter.com/eKYekWM23s
