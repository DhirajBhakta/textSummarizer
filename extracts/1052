Shobhaa De mocks a cop, Mumbai Police corrects her.
On a day when Mumbai went to the polls and recorded its highest voting percentage, author Shobhaa De tweeted an image of an overweight man in uniform and mocked the city police's 'heavy' arrangements. When the targets of her pun found out what she'd done, they swiftly denied that the man in the photo worked for them, and said they "expected better" from De. Here's De's tweet. Heavy police bandobast in Mumbai today! pic.twitter.com/sY0H3xzXl3And here's the message tweeted by the Mumbai Police, and pinned to De.We love puns too Ms De but this one is totally imisplaced. Uniform/official not ours. We expect better from responsible citizens like you. https://t.co/OcKOoHO5bXDe posted her tweet after voting was in over in Mumbai. It has been re-tweeted over 150 times and received over 400 likes. Some marked the tweet to the Mumbai Police, who took it seriously and responded promptly.Mumbai police sources said the photograph De posted was giving the department a very bad name, and that it was a question of its image. That's why the reply was so speedy.NO OFFENSE INTENDEDSince the tide turned against Shobhaa she replied to the accusations. In her tweet she said that she did not intend to offend the police force. In fact, she said that if the image belonged to Madhya Pradesh Police then they should consult a dietician.
