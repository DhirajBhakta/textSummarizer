Explain delay in action against Sena MP: Air India to police.
Air India has asked Delhi Police to explain the delay in action against controversial Shiv Sena MP Ravindra Gaikwad who is accused of thrashing an elderly airline employee.The national carrier informed the police that no action against the parliamentarian was impacting the morale of its staff, nearly a month after the alleged incident. ?Any delay in taking action will give a wrong impression. The morale of the staff will also be affected,? Air India said in a letter.AI also asked the Delhi Police commissioner to take the two complaints made by the airline to a logical conclusion.Gaikwad was taken off a no-fly list by Air India and five other airlines earlier this month following an intervention from the civil aviation ministry, which had said legal proceedings against the Osmanabad MP would continue. The FIR was filed on March 23. There was no comment from police or the airline.Gaikwad sparked nationwide outrage last month after a video apparently showing him hitting a 60-year-old AI staffer went viral on social media. The MP has expressed regret to Parliament but has refused to apologise to the staff.
