Delhi biker injured as manja cuts throat.
A 35-year-old motorcyclists throat was slit on the Geeta Colony flyover on Friday afternoon after his neck got entangled in a manjha (kite flying string).The man, who lives in east Delhis Gokulpuri with his family and works as a supervisor at a private university in Noida, was headed to work on when the accident occurred.Eyewitnesses told police that the biker nearly collided with a truck passing by after the manjha slit his throat. While the trucker managed to prevent a collision, the victim fell off his motorcycle and collapsed.He was taken to a nearby hospital where he is undergoing treatment. The police said they will register a case against unknown persons. It was not immediately clear if the manjha was made in India or was a Chinese variant.On July 11, the National Green Tribunal had banned the use of manjha across the city. The green body passed the order following several deaths reportedly due to getting caught in the manja. Incidents of birds getting caught in the manjha are fairly common in Delhi.A bench headed by NGT chairperson justice Swatanter Kumar said: There shall be a total ban on the manja, which are made of nylon or any other synthetic material or are coated with synthetic non-biodegradable substances.
