World's only floating national park is in India.
A proposition to travel to the North East is always exciting, and Manipur is a place that provides a gateway to this picturesque part of the country. Most of us have heard about the iconic Loktak Lake, located in Bishnupur district, at a distance of 53km from Imphal. More so, because it is considered to be the largest freshwater lake in the eastern part of India. It is known among travellers and photographers due to the round-shaped floating swamps, called Phumdis in the local language.But that's not all that this lake has. Very few travellers are aware of Keibul Lamjao, which is the only floating national park in the world. Accessible only by the dugout canoes, this green beauty is perched in the middle of the Loktak Lake. This forest is home to the sangai, or the brow-antlered deer, which is one of the most endangered species of deer in the world. The sangai is the state animal of Manipur and is an important part of the sociocultural life of the people. There is even an annual festival of dance and music that is named after this rare animal. According to a census done in April 2014, the total number of sangais in Keibul stood at 204. If media reports are to be believed, the number fell in 2015, but it's not confirmed as the forest officials didn't have enough funds to carry out a head count that year.
