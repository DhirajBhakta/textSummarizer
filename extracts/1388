"I couldn't play in Aleppo, it was the city of death. Right now in Turkey, I can go out and enjoy. I can go to school although I didn't yet. That is why peace is important for everyone including you. However, millions of Syrian children are not like me right now and suffering in different parts of Syria. They are suffering because of adult people", she wrote to the newly inaugurated president.
