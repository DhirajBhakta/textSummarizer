India must aspire to become global power of happiness: Prez.
By Laxmi Devi Bengaluru, Apr 14 (PTI) President Pranab Mukherjee today underscored the need for India to be a global powerhouse not just in terms of economic parameters but also Gross National Happiness. "If we aspire to be one of the leading economic powers of the world, yes, we can be, but merely in statistical terms, in terms of gross domestic product (GDP), in terms of skill are not adequate," Mukherjee said after laying the foundation stone for the Bengaluru Dr B R Ambedkar School of Economics here. The President said the concept of development has changed now and international organisations like the World Bank and IMF are talking about development in terms of GDP as well as Gross National Happiness (GNH). "Along with GDP, GNH is considered as one of the important factors of development," Mukherjee emphasised. He expressed concern over unemployability of the youth in India, saying "600 million youth are entering the job market, but their employability is not adequate".
