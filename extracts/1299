Just working with me doesn't make anyone an actor: Shah Rukh.
Mumbai, Feb 4 (PTI) Making debut opposite Shah Rukh may be every Bollywood aspirants dream, but the superstar says working with him does not make anyone "an actor". Most of the actresses, including Deepika Padukone and Anushka Sharma, who made their debut with SRK, are doing fairly well in their careers, but the 51-year-old actor says they were experienced in some or the other way before starting their Bollywood journey.
