Record for highest last-wicket Test stand was set vs India.
198 Anderson & Root Eng v Ind, Trent Bridge, 2014163 Agar & Hughes Aus v Eng, Trent Bridge, 2013151 Collinge & Hastings NZ v Pak, Auckland, 1973143 Best & Ramdin WI v Eng, Edgbaston, 2012133 Bari & Raja Pak v WI, Bridgetown, 1977133 Khan & Tendulkar Ind v Bang, Dhaka, 2004130 Foster & Rhodes Eng v Aus, Sydney, 1903128 Higgs & Snow Eng v WI, The Oval, 1966137 Mailey & Taylor Aus v Eng, Sydney, 1924 The stand of 198 between James Anderson and Joe Root surpassed the previous highest of 163, curiously at Trent Bridge exactly a year ago to the week. Australias debutant No11 Ashton Agar made 98 alongside Phil Hughes at the start of the 2013 home Ashes. After 110 years the record for Englands best 10th wicket stand was finally overhauled. Wilfred Rhodes and RE Foster put on 130 in Sydney in 1903-04. Andersons maiden half-century completed the first instance in Test history of two No11s making 50 in the same match, after Mohammed Shamis unbeaten 51 for India on the second day. Root and Anderson established another first in cricket history, as this became the only Test to feature two century 10th-wicket partnerships  after Shami and Bhuvneshwar Kumar put on 111 together in Indias first innings. Andersons 81 is the highest score by an England No11, beating the 59 not out scored by John Snowagainst West Indies at The Oval in 1966. In 130 innings in his 94-Test career, Andersons previous career-best score was 34. He began this match with a Test average of 10.20, and in 210 first-class innings had never before made more than 37 not out. He had never previously made a half-century in any senior cricket for club, county or country. His career-best had stood for 13 years at 49 not out, opening the batting for Burnley at Todmorden in the Lancashire League in April 2001. So his 81 rates pretty well by comparison. And finally  Anderson has now made 98 Test runs this calendar year - one more than Alastair Cook.
