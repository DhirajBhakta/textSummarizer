Firefighter revives dog rescued from fire by performing CPR.
When a disaster like fire or earthquake strikes, our first reaction is to grab our dear ones and run. But what about the times when we get separated from someone we love in a moment of such crisisThat's where real life heroes come in.After an apartment in Santa Monica, California, caught fire recently, somebody's pet dog got trapped inside the burning building. When firefighter Andrew Klein noticed, he climbed into the building and rescued the poor dog.However, the dog, who's called Nalu, was no longer breathing and didn't have a pulse. Nalu had been "overcome by heat and smoke," the Santa Monica Fire Department said in a statement.Klein, a fireman from the Santa Monica Fire Department, did not give up. He performed a CPR on Nalu as people and his colleagues looked on. Nalu was also given oxygen through an oxygen mask designed for animals. Around 20 minutes after the CPR, as Klein and others kept coaxing him, Nalu began to breathe on his own again. "It was pretty amazing because I've been on a number of animal rescues like this that did not come out the same way that Nalu's story did," Klein told KTLA 5. "It was definitely a win for the whole team and the department that we got him back."Like Dr Derek Shepherd used to say on Grey's Anatomy, "It's a beautiful day to save lives." It always is.|| Read more at FYI ||Is culling the solution to stray dog menace in KeralaChandigarh youth spins dog and mercilessly hurls it against the wall
