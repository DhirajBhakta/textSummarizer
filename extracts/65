Kriti replies to Hate Story actress Bhairavi's remark on her.
It was last week that Kriti Sanon posted a video where she is dancing to a song from Mubarakan. Immediately Kamaal R Khan, the serial offender, posted a tasteless comment on the actor targeting the poor box office performnce of Kritis last cinematic outing, Raabta. Adding her voice to the chorus was actor Bhairavi Goswami who last appeared in Hate Story.Taking to Twitter, Bhairavi wrote, she is really behaving like a deranged woman. How did she become an actress. No headlight, no bumper. Even college students look better. The crass tweet soon got a serious backlash on Twitter with many questioning who Bhairavi was.But the best reaction, by far, has been that of Kriti herself. On Tuesday at an event, Kriti was asked by the media about Bhairavis tweet. Who is Bhairavi Goswami Kriti enquired. When told about Bhairavis filmography, the Bareilly Ki Barfi star said, I think, Im just happy for her. She got a lot of publicity. Now you guys know her name also, so yeah.Now, that is badass.Follow @htshowbiz for more
