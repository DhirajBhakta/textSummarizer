WhatsApp to bring back old text status.
WhatsApp may soon bring your good old status. The chat app recently killed the old status to launch a new Facebook-like Status tab to its interface. The update received mixed reactions from the users with many backlashing the company for removing the old status and turning the app into Facebook. But a latest beta released by the app hints that the feature may soon come back on the app. The new update which bumps the version up to 2.17.95 allows beta testers to put up a status text message, which is reflected on their profile page. And this status won't vanish unlike the photos, videos and gifs shared under the Status tab that disappear after 24 hours.  To view or set a status, user has to tap on three dots given at the top right corner of the WhatsApp interface and then go to Settings. Next tap on the display picture and go to 'About and phone number'. Set your status just like earlier and same options like Busy, Available and others to choose from.  Also Read:  WhatsApp's beta update finally adds separate buttons for voice and video calls
