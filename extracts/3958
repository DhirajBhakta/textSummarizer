Ex-Delhi Minister AK Walia quits Congress before MCD polls.
Dr. AK Walia, veteran Congress leader, has quit the party alleging that tickets for upcoming MCD elections were being sold for money. Walia, who held several major portfolios in the Sheila Dikshit government in Delhi, claimed that some of the tickets were given to 'outsiders' in his constituency. "I am pained. I have worked tirelessly for the party for years and now no one listens to me," Walia said."Every time a new committee was formed, they interviewed us like class 8 students. What is my use if they are unable to understand me," Walia said, adding, " I will now sit at home and work. Will look for other ways to serve Delhi." Walia's resignation just days ahead of MCD elections comes as a big jolt to Congress. The leader, who represented Laxmi Nagar constituency in his last stint as an MLA, enjoys a massive support in  East Delhi. A doctor by profession, Walia owns a nursing home in Laxmi Nagar.  The Congress has so far announced names of 267 candidates for the civic polls. Congress has fielded majority of first timers in the elections giving preference to youth over experience and also factoring winnability. There are 272 wards in three municipal corporations in the city, including 104 each in South and North Delhi Municipal Corporation and 64 in East Delhi Municipal Corporation, which are going to polls on April 23.
