But it is actually carrying only tomatoes.With tomato prices going through the roof, there is a scramble to procure whatever is available and the risk of theft has increased.Ironically, many farmers in Madhya Pradesh dumped tomatoes on the roads after a bumper production brought its price to lower than Re 1 per kg about a month ago. But now it is the most expensive vegetable and at Indore?s Devi Ahilya Bai Holker vegetable mandi.The sudden shortage has meant that the vegetable is being quoted at Rs 100 per kg.?Security of tomatoes with its skyrocketing prices is of considerable concern for wholesalers. Thieves attacked a tomato laden truck and looted 2600 kg tomatoes in Mumbai on July 15. This has added to Indore businessmen?s concerns,? said Santosh Narang, a wholesaler of the mandi.
