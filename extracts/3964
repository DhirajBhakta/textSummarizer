Kerala BJP candidate promises good beef supply if elected.
Even as the BJP-ruled Gujarat imposes life term for cow slaughter and Uttar Pradesh witnesses massive crackdown on illegal slaughterhouses, a BJP candidate in Kerala seems to be going against the party's tenets. Kerala is among the few places in India that place no restrictions on the consumption of cow meat.While most other BJP-led governments have been unequivocal in their support to measures that ban the sale and consumption of cow meat, one of the party's candidates in Kerala is making headlines for luring voters with the promise of "good beef" if elected. N Sreeprakash, the Bharatiya Janata Party candidate for the upcoming by-election in Malappuram, has promised that he will ensure the supply of good beef from clean slaughterhouses in his constituency."There will be efforts from my side to ensure good-quality beef at clean abattoirs," Sreeprakash  was quoted as saying by the Indian Express. Sreeprakash went to on to slam the Congress for banning cow slaughter during its tenure in Kerala. Sreeprakash's comments come just a dat after All India Majlis-E-Ittehadul Muslimeen Party president Asaduddin Owaisi slammed the Bharatiya Janata Party for its "hypocrisy" on beef and banning cow slaughter. 'The BJP's hypocrisy is that cow is mummy in Uttar Pradesh and yummy in the Northeast," Owaisi said.His comments were in reaction the Yogi Adityanath government's drive to strictly enforce Uttar Pradesh's ban on cow slaughter, even as a BJP member in Nagaland said that a ban on beef like the one in UP would not be enacted in the north-eastern state if the party came to power. Om Saturday, Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Raman Singh said that anyone found committing cow slaughter should be hanged.Notbaly, there is no ban on cow slaughter in Mizoram, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Tripura, Sikkim and BJP-ruled Arunachal Pradesh.
