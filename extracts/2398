HC stays women panel's order summoning Delhi Golf Club Secy.
The Delhi High Court on Thursday stayed the Meghalaya State Commission for Women?s (MSCW) order summoning the Delhi Golf Club secretary over the incident involving a Khasi woman being asked to leave the premier club allegedly because of her attire.Justice Vibhu Bakhru also sought response from Meghalaya women?s commission by September 8, the next date of hearing, on a petition filed by the Delhi Golf Club challenging the commission?s July 3 order. ?Prima facie, this court finds merit in the submissions of the counsel for the petitioner (the Delhi Golf Club). Consequently, the notice is stayed till further order of this court,? the High Curt said. The commission had directed the secretary of the club to appear in person before it on July 14. Challenging the commission?s order, the club said that the commission in Meghalaya did not have jurisdiction to issue such direction on an incident, which had happened outside that state. The commission acted upon a complaint made by Tailin Lyngdoh, a governess, who accused the club and its members of allowing racial profiling of people, which was tantamount to racial discrimination of tribal people, which is a punishable offence. On June 25, staffers of the Delhi Golf Club had asked Lyngdoh, an invited guest, to leave the dining room because her traditional Khasi attire ?jainsem? looked like a ?maid?s uniform?. Last week, the National Commission for Scheduled Tribes (NCST) also issued a notice to the Delhi Golf Club.
