Jet Airways passengers protest over non-functioning AC.
A Jet Airways flight scheduled for departure from Mumbai airport to Bhopal was stopped from taking off after it had reached the runway when around 130 fliers started protesting about the non-functional air conditioning system.Around 130 passengers were onboard the Jet Airways flight 9W 7083 (S2 4621) which was, scheduled for departure at 5:55 am from Mumbai and was to arrive in Bhopal by 7:25 am, was delayed by over an hour.After boarding the flight, several passengers started complaining of suffocation and non-functioning of the air conditioners. The cabin crew was contacted by several passengers who did nothing about the complaints. The pilot then proceeded from the bay to the runway and was about to take-off when all the agitated passengers reportedly stood up and started protesting. The aircraft was then forced to turn back towards the bay where the technical team looked into the issue and rectified it.An angry passenger shot a series of tweet about the incident.Agitated  passengers force @jetairways#9W7083 return to bay from runway in #Mumbai because the AC was not working. Pathetic@awasthisThe @jetairways flt #9W7083 was going to Bhopal. Why was the plane allowed to close door & proceed 2 take off if there was snag 1/2
