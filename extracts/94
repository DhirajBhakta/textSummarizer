Online assessment delayed Mumbai University results: Maha CM.
The Maharashtra government on Tuesday admitted that adopting online assessment system  by the University of Mumbai (MU) for evaluating answer papers delayed declaration of results. The state has now promised to implement the system gradually to avoid similar problems in the future.    It is a serious issue. The MU had recently shifted to an online system for assessment of answer papers, which caused a delay in completing the assessment work. Scenario would have been different if it had been implemented in stages, chief minister Devendra Fadnavis said.    Fadnavis was replying to a query raised by Nationalist Congress Party legislator and former deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar. The NCP leader said the university had failed to meet the July 31 deadline given by the governor Ch Vidysagar Rao for completing assessment work. Of 477 courses offered by the varsity, it declared results for only 173 courses on Monday. Asking the chief minister to intervene, Pawar said the issue had tarnished the universitys reputation in the country. Further delay in declaring results may also impact students who want to pursue higher education abroad, he added. Fadnavis said the online assessment system is the need of the hour and has been adopted worldwide. The system ensures that evaluators assess answer papers online, thus bringing transparency. The government will make sure that the system is implemented smoothly in phases, he said.   He also informed the assembly that of 17.50 lakh answer sheets, 14 lakh have been evaluated so far. The governor has now set a new deadline of August 5 to declare the pending 304 results.   Mark sheets of students, who wish to pursue higher education abroad, will be made available by August 15, Fadnavis said.
