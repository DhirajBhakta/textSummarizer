One of my haters hacked my Instagram account: Rakhi Sawant.
Actor Rakhi Sawant Instagram account has been a source of entertainment to her fans.  Rakhi regularly uploads  a number of hilarious videos and posts. Users were  shocked to find out  that her page suddenly got deleted on Monday morning.  It turns out that she isnt the one who has deleted her account. Rakhi, who has always spoken out her mind on various political issues on social media, claims that her Instagram account has been hacked by a hater. We  contacted Rakhi to find out what happened to her Instagram account that had more than 1 lakh followers. Mera Instagram account hack ho gaya hai. (My account has been hacked. I am very upset.  One of my haters have done this. This was a way I used to connect to my fans and so many stars including Salman Khan and Sohail Khan have told me that whenever they are depressed, they watch my videos for entertainment, she says. The 38-year-old doesnt plan to come back on Instagram any time soon because she feels that people have been humiliating her a lot on social media. Mein jab bhi koi post share karti hoon, log mujhe gandi galiyan dete hai. (Whenever I share a post, people use the filthiest abuses for me.) They think I am a slut. They have even bad mouthed my mom so many times. These things do affect me, adds Rakhi.
