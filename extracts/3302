Ending a three-decade-old howitzer drought, the Indian Army is all set to receive its first heavy ordnance as the first two guns out of the 145 M777 ultra light artillery guns it ordered from the US will be arriving today, a month ahead of schedule.The two 155mm/39 caliber ultra light howitzers will be firing at the Pokhran field firing range in Rajasthan today. "In fulfillment of the United States' Foreign Military Sale of 145 M777 ultra light weight howitzer to India, we are pleased to confirm that the first two weapon systems will land in India ahead of schedule over this weekend," a BAE Systems spokesman said in a statement."We continue to support the US government in integrating this new weapon system with the Indian Army's artillery modernisation program," he added.The acquisition of the 'Ultra Light Howitzers', thus called because at 4.2 tons, they weigh only a third of normal 155 mm howitzers. The guns, which can be carried underslung by heavy lift helicopters like the Chinook, will give the army tremendous flexibility especially along the mountainous border with China. The Bofors scandal that broke out nearly 30 years ago had badly hit the artillery modernisation of the Indian Army.  WATCH | All you should know about India's Rs 5000 crore M777 howitzer deal with US
