Nude Ayyappa devotees stopped from worshipping in K'taka.
4 Ayyappa devotees took their vow a bit too seriously and had been worshipping being nude in Kalghatgi village in Dharwad.This form of worship was criticised by the villagers, who sought this practice to be stopped immediately. Anil Patil, Prakash, Ganga Ram and Manjunath have been performing these rituals being nude, for the last 15 days. Their group leader, Ramesh Guruswamy said that this was their way of worshipping Lord Ayyappa. They thought by this unique way they would be able to please the deity.According to the tradition, Sabarimala devotees follow a 41-day austerity period where they maintain vegetarian diet, observe celibacy and stay away from liquor and other temptations.
