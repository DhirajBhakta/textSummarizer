Who is Bharat Arun, Indian cricket team's new bowling coach.
Bharat Arun has made a comeback into the Indian dressing room as he has been appointed bowling coach by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) on Tuesday.The unnamed BCCI committee comprising acting president CK Khanna, acting secretary Amitabh Choudhary and CoA member Diana Edulji met at the board headquarters in Mumbai.WATCH VIDEOSanjay Bangar and R Sridhar will remain the assistant and fielding coach respectively. All appointments have been made for a two year term.Arun has been handed a full-time role as bowling consultant Zaheer Khan will only be available for 150 days a year."I was very clear in my mind what my core team would be and you have just heard that," Shastri said after Choudhary announced the appointment in a press conference.His appointment marks a complete u-turn for the BCCI, which had named Zaheer as bowling consultant initially before clarifying that it was for specific overseas tours.There is also, no clarity on Rahul Dravid's position as batting consultant either."All depends on their availability, it depends on individuals, the number of days they want to give but their inputs will be invaluable and they are most welcome," was Shastri's cryptic response on queries regarding Zaheer and Dravid. The 54-year-old had previously served in the same capacity during Shastri's tenure as team director from 2014 to 2016. The former India bowler was also Shastri's teammate from their Under-19 and India days.Shastri, who was in London when his appointment was announced, also thanked the Cricket Advisory Committee -- comprising Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly and VVS Laxman -- for picking him for the high-profile job."I would like to thank the CAC because it is a privilege and honour to be India's coach. And I would like to thank the CAC for considering me worthy enough for the job," he said.
