Nehra talks about his 'scooter days' with Virender Sehwag.
Delhi boys Virender Sehwag and Ashish Nehra go back a long way with each other. They started playing for Delhi together in the 1997-98 season. The two young men were close off the field as well and formed a bond that would last for decades.Twenty years and incredible careers later, Sehwag, now happily retired, is wooing fans with his Twitter antics while Nehra is still going strong in international cricket.

He only picked up three wickets but his experience and abilities contributed largely to India's 2-1 series victory.Nehra, understandably, has been in the news, thanks to his key role in India's performances in the shortest formats of the game.

Good old days," Nehra said ESPNcricinfo. "We had a deal: Viru would drive on the way to the ground, while I would drive it on the return journey. As a bowler, I had a small bag, but his kit bag was big. So I would rest my head on that and nap while he was driving."It was also said that Sehwag would always end up eating Nehra's breakfast but the strapping fast bowler laid to rest these rumuors and revealed Viru would gulp down his share of milk instead.
