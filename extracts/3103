CBI denies NDTV charges, says it respects freedom of press.
Responding to the NDTV's allegations that the CBI raided its premises "without even conducting a preliminary enquiry" indicating "a witch-hunt against independent media", the central investigation agency today clarified that the searches were carried out based on search warrants issued by a competent court."It is clarified that searches have been carried out at the premises of the promoters and their offices based on search warrants issued by the Competent Court. CBI has not conducted any search of registered office of NDTV, media studio, news room or premises connected with media operations," the CBI said in its statement today."The CBI has registered the case based on the complaint of a share holder of ICICI Bank and NDTV after carrying out due diligence. Denigrating the allegations at this stage of investigation and wrongly accusing the agency of acting under pressure is uncalled for and an attempt to malign the image of the CBI," it said."It has been mentioned in the statement of NDTV that NDTV and its promoters have never defaulted on any loan. The allegations under investigation are not regarding the default in loan repayment, but relate to the wrongful gain of Rs 48 crore to the promoters (Prannoy and Radhika Roy)," the CBI said.CBI HAS JURISDICTION OF CASES OF PRIVATE BANKS On the NDTV's questioning of jurisdiction over a case involving a private bank, the CBI said, "It is clarified that the Honourable Supreme Court in the case of Ramesh Gelli vs CBI of 2016, held that the provisions of Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 are applicable to the officials of private banks. Therefore, CBI has jurisdiction to take up investigation of the cases of private banks." On Monday, shortly after CBI sleuths raided NDTV offices and homes of the Roys in New Delhi, Dehradun and Mussourie, NDTV issued a statement accusing the CBI of a "blatant political attack on the freedom of the press"."It is clearly the independence and fearlessness of NDTV's team that the ruling party's politicians cannot stomach and the CBI raid is merely another attempt at silencing the media," the NDTV statement said."The CBI has been compelled to file an FIR based on a shoddy complaint by a disgruntled former consultant at NDTV called Sanjay Dutt, who has been making false allegations and filing cases in courts of law with these false allegations," the news channel said."Even though lakhs and crores of rupees of dues have not been paid by several industrialists and no criminal case has yet been registered against any of them by the CBI, the CBI has chosen not only to register an FIR, but also conduct a search for a loan which has been duly repaid to ICICI Bank. Moreover, ICICI is a private bank," NDTV said in its statement.Dismissing the charges, the CBI today said it "fully respects the freedom of press and is committed to the free functioning of news operations".Also read: CBI raids residence of NDTV founders in criminal conspiracy, cheating case
