Indrani to oppose son Mikhail's claim on Sheena's property.
Mumbai, Mar 16 (PTI) Indrani Mukerjea, accused in the Sheena Bora murder case, today told the special CBI court here that she would oppose her estranged son Mekhails claim on Sheenas share of ancestral property. Mekhail Bora has moved the Guwahati district court, seeking probate (verification by court) of the will of his grandmother, Indrani told the court in Mumbai today. The Guwahati court directed that if Indrani, who is lodged in a prison here, had any objections she should submit them in person or through a lawyer. Indrani, who was present before the special court here, told the judge that she planned to object to Mekhails claim on Sheenas share of grandmothers property. Her (Indranis) mother had nowhere said that in the event of Sheenas death her share will go to Mekhail, Indrani said.
