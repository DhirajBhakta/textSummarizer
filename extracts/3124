Kannada actress Avantika accuses producer of harassment.
Avantika Shetty, who was roped in to play the female lead in the upcoming film Raju Kannada Medium, has accused producer K Suresh of 'objectifying' her.  Taking to Twitter, Avantika wrote, "The problem started from the very first day of the schedule of the film when I sensed that it wasn't my performance the producer and the director really bothered about." Elaborating further, Avantika said that she was denied remuneration for the film. I hope no other girl has to go through this.............. pic.twitter.com/JX4roj1WcN"I had almost completed the film and a very small portion which was to be shot in Bangkok was left. The next thing I know, I was unceremoniously asked to leave back to Mumbai citing my average performance in the film as the reason, which surprisingly came up after I asked them about a bounced cheque, (sic)" she wrote.The actor, who is best known for her role in Rangitaranga, has now approached the Karnataka court for a settlement. While Avantika has registered a formal complaint with the Karnataka Film Chamber, vice-president Umesh Banakar has denied the news. Speaking about the issue, Umesh was quoted by Times Of India as saying, "We will examine the agreement signed between him and Avantika, and hear his side of the story. If he has any grievance to be addressed, we may have to call Avantika too. In any case, I hope the issue will be settled amicably."According to Rockline Venkatesh, secretary of the Kannada Film Artistes Association, Avantika Shetty is not a member of the chamber.
