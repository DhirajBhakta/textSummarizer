 A man who was on the run for 12 years after murdering a 65-year-old woman in Delhi was arrested from Dwarka sector 16-A on Saturday.The accused, Raju alias Painter (33), and his three associates - Dharmender, Arun Kumar and Vikas Yadav - had murdered Indira Devi (65) at her Vikaspuri flat late on January 25 night in 2004. Raju was a small-time civil contractor and was hired by Devi to paint her flat. He deputed Dharmender, Arun and Vikas for this work.

A trap was laid and Raju was apprehended,? said Yadav. During interrogation, Raju confessed to his crime. Raju told police that in 2003, he had painted Devi?s flat and she hired him again a year later. He said he and his associates tied Devi?s hands and legs and strangulated her.
