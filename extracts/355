Blogger slams people for abusive comments on bikini pic.
While social media allows each and every user to make their voice heard, it also has a flip side. People get away with making abusive remarks under the guise of ?trolling?. Recently, a popular UK-based fashion blogger, Callie Thorpe (149k followers) received over 900 vile comments. Her crime? Posting a happy poolside picture of her sporting a black two-piece bikini.   A post shared by Callie Thorpe (@calliethorpe) on Jul 18, 2017 at 4:53am PDTThe picture was featured on iconic fashion magazine Vogue?s website, alongside pictures of models such as Karlie Kloss, Bella Hadid and Kendall Jenner. Thorpe then did an interview with Yahoo about it. As it picked up traction, the comments came pouring in. One of them read: ?Realistically models are meant to be appealing not to make me puke.? Yahoo has since removed the comments section on that article. Thorpe has been a promoter of a healthy, body positive image and self-love on her Instagram page. Though hurt, she is undeterred. She posted a video, titled Dealing with abuse, about how she felt when she read those comments. At one point in the video, she breaks down. ?I couldn?t get it out of my brain. I couldn?t sleep because of some of the things I read about myself,? she said. But she is not ready to give up. She continues to remain proud of herself, and is determined to keep doing what she loves. Follow @htlifeandstyle for more
