Kamal Haasan should be TN CM for a day: Director Alphonse.
Kamal Haasan is well-known for raising his voice regarding matters concerning politics and artistic liberties. Be it his personal life or as an actor, Haasan has been bold and outspoken. At times, even at the cost of his own peace. Unlike Rajinikanth, Kamal Haasan has always stayed away from politics. Now, Alphonse Putharen, who shot to fame after directing the blockbuster Malayalam film Premam, took to his Facebook page and said he wanted to see the Nayagan actor as the chief minister of Tamil Nadu for a day."If there is a option like in mudhalvan film...to appoint a chief minister for one day . I think Kamal Hassan should be given one day for caring Tamil Nadu . Just one day would do . I hope it happens soon. He would take government to next level with his innovative ideas. This is just my wish . Please forgive this child if I said something wrong, (sic)" he wrote.The post has gone viral on social media. Recently, the Vishwaroopam star hit out at the state government for imposing double taxation on the film industry. "Karnataka has gone even further to facilitate the well-being of the film industry. Telangana and Andhra (Pradesh) are also doing their best for their film industries. Bihar used to be the nation's whipping boy when it came to corruption. Now, Tamil Nadu has left Bihar leagues behind. Film industry is one among the many industries asphyxiated by the prevailing systemic corruption in the state. I anticipate even stronger protests soon," Kamal said in a statement. On the work front, Kamal Haasan, who is currently busy with the Tamil version of the reality show Bigg Boss, is waiting for the release of his highly anticipated Vishwaroopam 2.
