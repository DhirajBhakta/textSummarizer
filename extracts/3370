Taking lesson from the killing of the 22-year-old Army officer Lieutenant Ummer Fayaz in Shopian, the Indian Army has directed all soldiers to strictly follow guidelines of informing the local units before going home on leave in the Valley.  Sources in the security establishment said that there is a guideline which local officers or soldiers need to follow in the Valley. As per the guidelines, the Army unit in the area is informed well in advance about officers going on leave if he is from Kashmir. This is with respect to ensuring their safety."There is an existing direction to all heads of Army units across the state to ensure that no soldier/officer leaves his unit until there is a proper go ahead in terms of safety," said a source in the Army.  Lieutenant Ummer Fayaz was kidnapped and killed by gunmen in Shopian on May 10 and his bullet-riddled body was found in Harmain village.

Since Fayaz's brutal killing has come as a shock to the Army and the nation, it is expected that the soldiers and officers strictly follow the guidelines.
