Couple drop daughter at hospital, find her body at doorstep.
A 17-year-old girl in Tamil Nadu's Erode district who was being treated for epilepsy and weight loss by a herbal treatment centre died under mysterious circumstances. BhakyaSri was left under the care of the herbal treatment centre owner and relative Naveen Balalji by her parents on June 2 to attend a wedding function. To their shock, when they returned, they found BhakyaSri's dead body in a freezer box kept at the doorstep. Her parents then rushed her body to the General Hospital in Coimbatore for autopsy and filed a complaint in the Kavundhapadi Police Station against Balaji. BhakyaSri's father believes she was administered wrong dose of medicine which turned to be fatal and is now demanding strictest of action against Balaji. He also added that when they called in between June 2-6 to inquire about their daughter's health, the authorities said she was responding well and relaxing. According to testimony of BhakyaSri's neighbours, they saw the staff of the treatment centre drop off the freezer box on June 3. To add to their plight, the parents had to face blatant apathy at the Coimbatore General Hospital, where they were asked to pay Rs 3,000 as bribe to collect BhakyaSri's body from the morgue. Clash between the family members of BhakyaSri and Balaji broke out when he visited the family at the Coimbatore hospital. BhakyaSri's relatives claim that Naveen Balaji who runs the herbal treatment centre in Erode is a fraud and has no authorisation from medical bodies or the government.
