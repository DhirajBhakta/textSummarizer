Kohli's technical weakness covered by home pitches: Anderson.
England will not look to play for a draw on the final day of the fourth Test against India but would rather try to score quickly to set the hosts a target and keep alive the series, fast bowler James Anderson said on Sunday.The touring side, down 2-0 in the five-match series, trail India by 49 runs with four second-innings wickets remaining at the close of the fourth day.On a turning Wankhede Stadium pitch, batting fourth will not be easy for the hosts, who made 631 in their first innings.

I thought they did it with real positive intent and showed you can still score runs out there," Anderson told reporters."We hope that's given the lads down the order a bit of confidence going into tomorrow - because we're certainly not going to be trying to bat out for a draw.

"Coming to the ground this morning, needing to get three wickets with them 50 ahead, if we could get them we're still well in the game."Unfortunately we didn't bowl as well as we could have first thing."
