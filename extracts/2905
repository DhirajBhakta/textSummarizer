He said at the film's press conference, "When Kabir (director Kabir Khan) narrated the subject to me, he said, 'For this role we should get Shah Rukh.' So, when I called him and I told him that there is a small role in Tubelight which I would like you to do it, before completing my sentence, Shah Rukh said, 'I will do it.' That's how he made his entry into the movie."Tubelight, directed by Kabir Khan, is set to hit theatres on June 23. Set against the backdrop of the 1962 Sino-Indian War, the film also stars Chinese actor Zhu Zhu, Sohail Khan, Om Puri and Matin Rey Tangu in pivotal roles.
