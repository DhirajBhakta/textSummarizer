Deepika to replace Varun as lead in Badlapur sequel: Reports.
Badlapur, directed by Sriram Raghavan, was a turning point in Varun Dhawan's career and established his acting credentials. Made on a modest budget, the film went on to earn thrice its budget, and brought its director Sriram Raghavan (Ek Hasina Thi, Johnny Gaddaar) much-needed commercial success.Now, according to latest reports, a Badlapur sequel is being planned and it might just star none other than Deepika Padukone. Badlapur was a bloody, revenge thriller where the hero, played by Varun Dhawan, went on a killing rampage to punish those that were responsible for the end of his family. Will Deepika Padukone, then, for the first time be playing an ambiguous anti-heroine in Badlapur 2, if she is indeed doing the film?According a report in DNA, Badlapur producer Dinesh Vijan is keen on roping Deepika Padukone in for the film."A sequel to Badlapur, with a female protagonist and a completely new cast, is being planned. Dinesh has bounced the idea off to Deepika and she has loved it. It's a character-driven role, just like Varun's was in Badlapur. The script isn't ready yet and once that's done, the producer will give the actress a full narration and get her dates blocked for the film," a source was quoted as saying.Badlapur producer Dinesh Vijan, who has turned director with the upcoming film Raabta, has collaborated with Deepika Padukone thrice; Cocktail, Love Aaj Kal and Finding Fanny. His new Raabta stars Kriti Sanon as the leading lady, but even then Deepika Padukone is the star of the title track video.
