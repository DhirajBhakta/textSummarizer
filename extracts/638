IAF rescues pregnant woman from flooded Gujarat village.
Acting with lightening speed - peculiar to the Men in Blue and their flying machines, an Indian Air Force Chetak helicopter took flight within minutes of the IAF receiving a request for immediate evacuation of two pregnant women in critical condition, 'about to deliver'.The message with the location details was received at 4:30pm and the Chetak got airborne from Jamnagar at 4:40pm to head for the site.It took barely anytime for the seasoned heads and hands at work at HQ Southern Western Air Command  Gandhinagar coordinating Human Assistance and Disaster Relief operations in the area in choosing a Chetak helicopter for this particular operation - owing to its much lesser all up weight as compared to a MI-17V5. Keeping in view - the medical condition of those to be evacuated, the aircraft would need to land to take them on board safely (in all probability on a patch of soft ground as reported by district officials at the site).While the aircraft was enroute to Nana Matra Village of Vinchia Taluka in Rajkot district - the district administration officials informed that one of the two women to be evacuated had already delivered a set of twins and needed to be airlifted immediately. By 5:15pm, the 'Saviour Chetak' was already overhead looking for a safe patch to land. The mother, with her new born twins and an attendant were instantaneously put into the aircraft and flown out to safety with due care. The aircraft landed at Jasdan helipad where they were handed over to the medical team already waiting for the aircraft on ground.The aircraft then returned to Nana Matra, this time picking up another pregnant woman bleeding profusely, in need of urgent medical attention. The lady along with an attendant was quickly evacuated and flown across the river where the medical staff and ambulance in wait took over.It is learnt that due to excessive flooding and damage to the access road, the village Nana Matra had become inaccessible for vehicles necessitating timely aerial evacuation by IAF to save previous lives.ALSO READ:IAF turns 83: PM Modi salutes Air Force's courage, determinationIndian Air Force plans to add muscle to SukhoisSukhoi-30 crash: Pilots onboard IAF aircraft confirmed dead, were unable to eject on timeALSO WATCH: Road rage shocker: IAF officer thrashed and robbed by 3 men in Delhi, video goes viral
