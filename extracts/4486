I am not afraid of ABVP. I am not alone. Every student of India is with me. #StudentsAgainstABVP"."The brutal attack on innocent students by ABVP is very disturbing and should be stopped. It was not an attack on protesters, but an attack on every notion of democracy that is held dear in every Indians heart. It is an attack on ideals, morals, freedom and rights of every person born to this nation," she said in a Facebook status."The stones that you pelt hit our bodies, but fail to bruise our ideas. This profile picture is my way of protesting against the tyranny of fear," she added.The literature students classmates and peers started sharing the post, prompting students from various universities across the country to change their profile pictures with the same placard, as the initiative went viral.Kaurs Facebook post so far has 2,100 reactions, 3,456 shares and 542 comments.
