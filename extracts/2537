						Tiger said: ?As an individual, I am little different. I want to practice and prepare to set my skill and signature as an actor different. I want to make a mark. I think only through practice you can reach perfection. Yes, I can do a lot of re-takes, but taking the extra struggle will help me to prove myself differently.?After making his Bollywood acting debut in 2014 with Heropanti, he became a star. Still, he has managed to maintain warmth with people around him.Tiger Shroff and Nidhhi Agarwal during a press conference to promote their upcoming film Munna Michael in Mumbai.

						?My dad?s (actor Jackie Shroff) personality definitely influenced me a lot. Dad didn?t change even a little bit after becoming a celebrated actor. He stayed in a ?chawl? even after the success of his films, stood in a queue for public toilets... watching dad while growing up...those things teach you a lot.? ?So yes, earning respect and staying humble is the life lesson that dad teaches us,? said Tiger.And he has many female fans chasing him.?I don?t think too much about that. Every morning I get up and thank the almighty for all the love and admiration I am receiving from people, my fans... from everyone. Then I go back to my zone... to make my skill sharper...? he said.Follow @htshowbiz for more
