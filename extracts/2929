No difference in good and bad terrorists: India to BRICS.
Minister of State for External Affairs Gen (retd)VK Singh today delivered a strong message on combatting terrorism at the first summit of BRICS foreign ministers in Beijing, urging countries "to not differentiate" between "good and bad terrorists".India hopes the bloc of emerging countries will take a strong and unified stand on terrorism. Gen Singh's message in Beijing took on added salience, considering that the Chinese government has been a prominent obstacle in other fora, such as the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), to India's attempts to sanction terrorists based in Pakistan.While not mentioning Pakistan, Gen Singh, who was attending the meet as External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj was unable to travel for health reasons, struck an optimistic note in a press conference following his summit with the foreign ministers of Brazil, Russia, China and South Africa. He said "all BRICS countries agreed that terrorism is the common enemy of humankind and are fully concerned about the threat of terrorism in its various forms and manifestations"."On behalf of India, I pointed out that terrorism remains one of the most potent global menaces. We did bring out that it threatens global peace and terrorists cannot be differentiated by calling them good or bad," he said."They are terrorists and they are criminals and we need to have a concerted action both in the region and internationally to curb their activities," he said."We have a consensus among the BRICS countries that all (forms of) terrorism must be condemned and various measures must be taken to cooperate so that terrorism does not spread and harm any one of our countries", he added.Gen Singh also called for "expediting the adoption of the Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism at the United Nations which has been pending for some time" and said that India "has the support of all the BRICS countries" on this issue.'CHINA ALSO A VICTIM OF TERROR'Yet how much India's push will find support in China remains unclear. Next month, the UNSC will revisit an application to sanction Pakistani terrorist Masood Azhar that Beijing, at Pakistan's behest, placed a "technical hold" on.China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Monday defended China's stance on terror when asked about differences with India, saying that "China opposes terror in all forms"."China is also (a) victim of terror and China is taking part in global initiatives against terror," he said. "With colleagues today including Indian colleagues China shares the same position."Gen Singh noted that BRICS launched a joint working group on counter-terrorism which held a meeting last month. He also said National Security Adviser Ajit Doval will likely travel to Beijing next month for a BRICS NSAs meet that will also discuss terror and security cooperation."The BRICS agenda has witnessed steady expansion," Gen Singh said. "The joint working group on counter terror concluded its meeting in May. Our NSAs are scheduled to meet next month. In their meeting last year, they reached significant understanding to enhance BRICS cooperation in security and counter-terrorism"."India attaches utmost importance to engagement with BRICS countries," he added. "The Prime Minister has repeatedly underscored the role of BRICS in the international arena and stressed the importance of fostering intra-BRICS cooperation". INDIA WANTS BRICS GROUP TO PUT OUT STRONG STATEMENT ON TERRORIndia will want the BRICS grouping to put out a strong statement on terrorism as it holds a summit in Xiamen, southern China, in September which PM Narendra Modi will attend.On Sunday, both countries looked to bring recently strained relations back on track as Gen Singh held talks with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi. He said "India looks forward to strengthening and deepening its strategic partnership and mutual dialogue with China."Wang was quoted as saying by the official Xinhua news agency that "China and India are both major countries with great influence, and that they should boost cooperation in the BRICS, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) and all other multilateral frameworks to make contribution to peace and stability in the region and the world at large."This is the first major visit from India after Delhi became the only major country to boycott President Xi Jinping's Belt and Road summit on May 14.External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj had been scheduled to attend Monday's first ever standalone BRICS foreign ministers' meeting. Previous interactions among the foreign ministers of the grouping had only been held on the sidelines of other summit - but as Gen Singh told Wang, "She wanted to come but then health and other restrictions on her did not permit her. But she was looking forward to meeting you."The ministers on Monday called on Chinese President Xi Jinping. Xi's government is going all out to ensure the BRICS summit in September, which Xi will host in Xiamen in Fujian province where he was earlier a provincial leader, will be seen as a success, with the Communist Party of China also hosting a key once-in-five-year leadership congress, likely to be held in Beijing the following month.
