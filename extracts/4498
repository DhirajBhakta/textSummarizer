Stop hypocrisy, open your mind: Disha to slut-shamers.
Disha Patani's outfit at Filmfare Awards this year got a thumbs up from the fashion police, but the 'sanskaaris' on social media were up in arms over it, with moral lessons to offer. The MS Dhoni actor's outfit came under scrutiny for being "too revealing". It all began when a picture of a man checking out Disha's cleavage during the awards show went viral. Soon enough, the 24-year-old was trolled on social media for her outfit. She was called names on Instagram for her choice of outfit. But she gave it back to her haters with an epic response, and said that she is "not going to be anybody's idea of an Indian girl." She added, "It's easier to judge a woman on the basis of how much they cover up their skin, but it's hard to accept your own cheap mentality where you can't stop staring at those inappropriate areas which you are asking her to cover!"Really felt a need to share this! ???? thanks to my fan clubs friends and family for always giving me the strength i hope we all can find this strength from within each other and stop suffering ???? #spreadloveA post shared by disha patani (paatni) (@dishapatani) on Feb 21, 2017 at 2:59am PST She added, "Really felt a need to share this! (sic)" And asked people to stop this hypocrisy and open their minds. Recently, singer Monali Thakur too was slut-shamed for wearing 'short-dresses' on a reality TV show.
