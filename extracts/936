In the wake of the growing tensions between India and China following the recent Doklam standoff, several people across the country have raised their voices in protest. A Gujarat-based company has chosen to protest in a unique way. The company has asked its dealers and associates to boycott their Chinese phones and promised them Indian phones instead to its 400 dealers.A poster used by the company on its Facebook profile stated that the only way to protest against Chinese incursion was to stop using Chinese phones. The company has also requested its dealers not to buy any phones made in China. The firm has announced to give away Intex S1 and Karbonn K95 phones which are made in India.In the poster, the business emphatically stated that it was the duty of the citizens towards the Indian Army guarding the borders."China has been provoking India frequently of late. If we want to fight them, we need to target their economy by not buying Chinese products. This is why we have decided to give away Indian-made phones to our dealers who are using Chinese phones. Every citizen should come forward and boycott Chinese products," Managing Director of Rudra TMX, Nikhil Gupta told  Divya Bhaskar.Meanwhile, China has reportedly moved 'tens of thousands of tonnes' of military vehicles and equipment to Tibet under the pretext of two defence exercises held on the plateau in recent weeks.
