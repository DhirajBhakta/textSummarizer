Remains on Mont Blanc may belong to Air India crash victims.
Body parts that could belong to passengers killed in one or other of two Air India plane crashes more than 50 years ago have been found on Mont Blanc in the French Alps, sources said Friday.Daniel Roche, who is fascinated by air plane accidents and has spent years combing the Bossons Glacier looking for remains, made the discovery on Thursday.I had never found any significant human remains before, he told AFP. This time however he had found a hand and the upper part of a leg.In January 1966, an Air India Boeing 707 from Bombay to New York crashed near Mont Blancs summit, killing all 117 people on board.The HindustanTimes front page on January 24, 1966.

						Roche said the remains he had found could be of a female passenger from the 1966 Boeing 707 flight, as he also discovered one of the planes four jet engines.Roche contacted local emergency services in the Chamonix valley who took the remains down the mountain by helicopter and they were due to be examined by experts.These remains are probably not from the same person, said Stephane Bozon of the local gendarmerie.They are probably from passengers, but between the two aircrafts, its difficult to say.This handout picture shows a piece of a leg, which could belong to a victim of one of two Air India crashes which occurred in 1950 and 1966, on the Mont Blanc massif, French Alps.
