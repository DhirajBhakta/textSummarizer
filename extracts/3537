Patanjali to finish multinationals in India in 5 yrs: Ramdev.
Saharanpur (UP), Apr 30 (PTI) Yoga guru Ramdev said today that Patanjali Ayurveda, promoted by him, will steal the march over multinational firms manufacturing consumer products. Comparing them to the East India Company that had entered the country with a purpose to "loot", Ramdev said that he aims to make India free from the MNCs. He said that the MNCs here were not working for the countrys development, rather their sole objective was to "loot" India. "Patanjali agle panch varshon mein in videshi kampaniyon ko moksh de degi ( Patanjali will finish the MNCs up from the Indian market in next five years)," he said.
