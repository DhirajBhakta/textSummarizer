Adopt broken schools to revamp UP's education: Yogi to MLAs.
In a mega push to the formative levels of education in Uttar Pradesh, the Yogi Adityanath government has proposed that all primary schools in the state be adopted by party functionaries, MLAs, ministers and even government officials and revamp them in just one year.Chief minister Adityanath wants to rope in all stakeholders in the state apparatus to revamp the state's education system.Since quality education is fundamental to development, the CM has ordered all party functionaries, MLAs, ministers and even government officials to adopt at least one primary school in the state and show tangible improvements in at this formative level of education and learning within a year.100 DAYS OF YOGIThe announcement came as the Yogi government completes its 100 days in power and the party apparatus, in association with the government machinery, has started organising 'Jan Kalyan Sammelans' (public welfare gathering) across the state at the mandal level to inform the people of its achievements in these first 100 days."UP has inherited a broken educational system and this has been its Achilles heel for long. Due to political considerations, vested interests within the former SP and BSP regimes have hitherto wanted to deliberately keep education in a bad shape."But, we have a different vision: we want to make education as the driver of the state's education in future and that needs some serious efforts."Adopting schools personally will get each school adequate attention. Primary level is the formative level of education and we are trying to rebuild this level for a better superstructure," said UP BJP spokesperson Chandra MohanMoreover, the UP government seems to have found itself in an advantageous position as the BJP at the Centre is also celebrating its three years in power.The coincidence of the two have allowed the state government to enumerate among its own the efforts of the Union government in UP."We are taking the achievements of the Yogi government to the people of UP by means of local gatherings called the 'Jan Kalyan Sammelan' in all the mandals of the state.These programmes started from Sunday. We are also telling people about the achievements of the central government. We have brought electricity to rural areas and the chief minister has announced that individual connections will be given free. We have decided to give 10 lakh houses to the poor, urban as well as rural," Mohan said.
