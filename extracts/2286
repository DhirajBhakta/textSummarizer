Maharashtra first state to enact anti-social boycott law.
Maharashtra has become the first state to make social boycott a crime after President Pranab Mukherjee cleared the legislation. The Maharashtra Prohibition of People from Social Boycott (Prevention Prohibition and Redressal) Act prescribes a maximum punishment of three year in jail and a fine of Rs1lakh. It aims to prevent atrocities carried out by extra-judicial courts and caste panchayats. After the Presidents assent, the Maharashtra government published the Act in the gazette. The bill was cleared by the state legislature in April and was sent to the President for his approval. The Act has been cleared by the Central government. We are in the process of issuing a notification, Sudhir Shrivastava, additional chief secretary for home, told HT.The Act also provides for compensation to victims. The fines imposed on violators will be used to compensate them. The Act also has a provision to withdraw cases with the consent of victims and permission from a court. In case of a withdrawal, the accused will have to perform community service. Hamid Dabholkar, activist of Maharashtra Andhshradha Nirmulan Samiti and son of slain anti-superstition crusader Narendra Dabholkar, said their three-and-a-half-year-old demand had been met. We believe the Act is a tribute to Narendra Dabholkar, who had started the fight.READUnfortunate that cops ignored testimony: Hamid DabholkarDabholkar murder: CBI to produce Tawade in court on June 16
