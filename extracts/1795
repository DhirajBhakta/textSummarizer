Between November 10-December 23, the total deposits in Jan Dhan accounts reported is Rs 41,523 crore in 48 lakh accounts. This, together with the total deposits of Rs 45,637 crore as on November 9, takes the aggregate amount in Jan Dhan accounts to over Rs 87,100 crore.

If it is found that money deposited in these accounts belong to some other persons, necessary action will be taken at appropriate time," the official told PTI.
