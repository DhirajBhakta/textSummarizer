Punjab should limp back as it was looted by dacoits and thieves. Why Badals were defeated is that they treated politics as business. I consider it as a medium to change the fate of Punjab that's why I am able to stand with dignity," Sidhu said.Slamming Arvind Kejriwal, Navjot Singh Sidhu said the Delhi chief minister tried to fool the people but failed as the people of Punjab are intelligent."Kejriwal lost as his motives was selfish. He tried to troll us on social media by hired 'pappus'," Navjot Singh Sidhu said.Sidhu's margin of votes is nearly six times higher compared to his wife Navjot Kaur Sidhu's 2012 win on the same seat during the state's previous Assembly elections. Amritsar East constituency was once of the most watched constituency this time as Sidhu not only made the contest triangular but also faced BJP, which had a stronghold in Amritsar district.
