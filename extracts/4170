BJP will have to perform role of Oppn as well: Uma Bharti.
Union Minister for Water Recourses Uma Bharti on Monday sais that the ruling Bhartiya Janta Party will have to stay alert and on a continuous vigil as there was no Opposition in the country. "We have just recorded an unprecedented victory in the biggest state of India. We also have a majority in the Lok Sabha. The biggest take away of this election is that the popularity of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has increased from what it was in May 2014 but at the same time we can see that that there is no Opposition. So we will have to perform the role of the Opposition as well," Bharti said while addressing a press conference in Bhopal."These election results have shown that we have reached a position which the Congress had occupied for a long time after the Bangladesh war of liberation but at that time we were a strong Opposition and provided the glue around which all opposition parties stuck. The Congress, however, is not in that position and is fast losing the little credibility that it had. The party does not have any standing of its own and is trying to latch on to regional players for face saving. This puts an additional responsibility on the BJP," Bharti said.On parallels being drawn between her coronation as chief minister in 2003 and that of Yogi Adityanath as chief minister of Uttar Pradesh in 2017, Bharti said, "The saffron colour of robes is not the only similarity that we have. He is like my younger brother and I stay at the Gorakhpur math whenever I go there but the colour of the robes has nothing to do with the performance of any chief minister. Adityanath is an able administrator and he will take strong steps to improve the law and order situation in the state.
