Hyderabad: 47 minors caught watching porn in police raids.
The Hyderabad police are in soup after they took into custody 47 minors and paraded them in front of the media for watching porn at internet cafes in the Old City on Wednesday. The South Zone wing of the department had conducted raids at various internet cafes wherein they caught red-handed many minors watching pornographic content.The minors, aged between 10-18 years, were let off after a counselling session in the presence of their parents. However, the police sought help of media persons to publicize its massive drive to 'curb on cyber offence', raising eyebrows of many child rights activists. There are strict laws and guidelines against identities of minors in conflict with law or in vulnerable positions being disclosed.
