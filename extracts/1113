Delhi Metro to get swipe machines for online transactions.
If you have faced a problem making payment via card to recharge your Delhi Metro Smart Card, it is likely to be resolved soon. The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC), after receiving complaints from several commuters, has awarded contracts for new card swipe machines. These will start arriving next week.Cash transactions reduced significantly at Metro stations after the November 8 recall of old 1,000 and 500-rupee bills, with more and more people switching to digital mode of payment.The DMRC also accept payments through Paytm, but many commuters prefer to recharge their smart cards from the customer care counters.?For the past few days, the card swipe machine has not been working at the Vaishali Metro station. I tried at a few other stations too but there were network issues and the transaction got declined. What is the point of going cashless when you don?t have the infrastructure,? said Raksha Singh, a regular Metro commuter.The DMRC will install 400 new card swipe machines for the facilitation of online transactions at its stations as part of a new tender.?By and large, the point-of-sale machines used for card payments are working fine across the system. However, on occasions there may be connectivity-related issues. The system is expected to get further streamlined in the days to come as fresh tendering process for these machines is currently underway,? said DMRC spokesperson Anuj Dayal.Another DMRC official said that once the new stock arrives, every station will have at least two such machines.?There were many stations where no machine was available while at few only one machine was available. Now we will have machines at 160 customer care centres so that customers do not have to face problems in case they want to use card for payment,? the official added.
