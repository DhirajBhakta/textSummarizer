Censor Board orders 48 cuts in 'Babumoshai Bandookbaaz'.
The latest victim of Pahlaj Nihalani-led CBFC's (Central Board of Film Certification) draconian measures is Nawazuddin Siddiqui's upcoming film Babumoshai Bandookbaaz. Nihalani has ordered 48 cuts in the film - yes, you read that right. F-O-R-T-Y E-I-G-H-T cuts.When asked about the number of cuts that have been ordered in Babumoshai Bandookbaaz, Nihalani told India Today Television, "We are just doing our job."The blow from the censor board comes just days after news broke that Pahlaj Nihalani might have to step down as the CBFC chairman owing to the numerous controversies that his methods have landed him in. While there is no update on that front, his order of 48 cuts for Babumoshai Bandookbaaz have come as a shock to the makers of the film.Babumoshai Bandookbaaz, which stars Nawazuddin Siddiqui and Bidita Bag in the lead roles and is directed by Kushan Nandy, has been embroiled in controversies for quite some time now. First, Chitrangda Singh walked out of the film saying that she was uncomfortable with the numerous explicit scenes in the film.After that, the filmmakers roped in Bengali actress Bidita Bag.The casting director of Babumoshai Bandookbaaz, Sanjay Chouhan, then said in an interview how it was not possible for him to cast a 'fair and handsome actor opposite Nawazuddin Siddiqui'. Nawaz did not take the comment lying down and went on Twitter to say how he never concentrated on his looks."Thank U 4 making me realise dat I cannot b paired along wid d fair & handsome bcz I m dark & not good looking, but I never focus on that. (sic)" read Nawaz's tweet.Babumoshai Bandookbaaz is slated for a release on August 25 this year. But it remains to be seen when the CBFC finally gets around to clearing the film. Or if Babumoshai Bandookbaaz too has to knock on the Revising Committee's door to get a certificate.OPINION: Nawazuddin Siddiqui is the finest actor we have. Why the racism, Bollywood
