They then found what Quarles said was a medium-sized bug.When I grabbed the bug and I had it, I went to light it and then the lighter started sparking, so these sparks then went onto the box springs, Quarles said. The sparks just started flying on it and inside of it.The flames and heavy smoke led to the evacuation of the three-floor building.By the time the smoke had cleared, Topeka Fire Department officials estimated $140,000 in damage had occurred.No serious injuries were reported in the blaze.Multiple fire companies responded to the two-alarm blaze and remained on the scene for about six hours, clearing the scene.Quarles said her daughter saw the fire, then ran into the kitchen to get water to put it out.As shes coming, Im going. By the time I came back, I was really seeing fire in there, so I knew we really shouldnt keep trying to put it out. I said, Get out, get the baby, call 911. And thats what we did, she said.Authorities said everyone was out of the building by the time firefighters arrived on the scene.
