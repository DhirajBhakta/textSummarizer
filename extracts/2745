Our bowling is something else, Riteish Deshmukh on India win.
Spinner Ekta Bisht wreaked havoc as India thrashed arch-rival Pakistan by 95 runs in their ICC Women's World Cup encounter at Derby on Sunday.  Defending a lowly target of 170 runs, the Indian eves were spectacular with the ball as they didn't allow their arch-rival to claim a historic win and bowled out Pakistan for just 74 runs in 38.1 overs.  Ekta started casting her magic from the very start and was absolutely lethal, giving nothing away and picking wickets right from the beginning. Captain Sana Mir was the lone Pakistan batter who fought soulfully till the very end. However, her 29 runs off 73 balls couldn't help her team register their first win of the tournament. Ekta was the pick of the Indian bowlers as she picked up five wickets for just 18 runs in her allotted 10 overs. She was well supported by Mansi Joshi (2/9), Jhulan Goswami (1/12), Deepti Sharma (1/21) and Harmanpreet Kaur (1/6). Earlier, the Mithali Raj-led side was done by some fine bowling performance by Pakistan as they registered their lowest total of the tournament.
