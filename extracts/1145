Probe Kejriwal's nexus with militants in Punjab: Amarinder.
Chandigarh, Feb 15 (PTI) Reacting to the arrest of Nabha jailbreak mastermind from the alleged house of an AAP worker, Punjab Congress president Amarinder Singh today sought a probe into what he called Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwals "nexus" with militants and gangsters in the state. The Congress chief ministerial candidate flagged concern over the arrest of Gurpreet Singh Sekhon from the house of an Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) activist, just two weeks after Kejriwal had courted controversy by staying at a KLF militants home in Punjab. There is apparently a "strong nexus between AAP and the militants as well as dreaded gangsters, posing a major threat to Punjabs security and safety", alleged Amarinder, demanding an independent investigation, preferably by a central agency, into the partys "dangerous" links.
