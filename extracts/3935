"What is happening is Delhi is unfortunate," he said.Dikshit's offensive comes hours after former Delhi MLA Amrish Gautam quit Congress and joined the BJP while former Congress minister AK Walia threatened to quit over ticket distribution for the civic polls.Dikshit said those quitting Congress at this juncture would lose his sympathy. "Even though Maken is indulging in condemnable acts, I appeal to all Congressmen not to quit the party otherwise they will lose my sympathy," he said.Dikshit alleged that the Delhi Pradesh Congress Committee was functioning like a business house and its in charge PC Chacko had become a party to it.He said, "Delhi Congress has also taken the same route as Uttarakhand. The high command should take note of this fact and also that one person is taking all the decisions," he said.He seconded party leader Arvinder Singh Lovely's charge that Maken does not take the calls of not just the party workers but also of the leaders.Meanwhile, Maken has defended the ticket distribution for the MCD elections.
