Don't mind getting married even when I'm 40 or 50: Shamita.
Actor Shamita Shetty is 38 and clearly is in no rush to get married. Even when her sister, actor Shilpa Shetty, 42, is already a mother to a five-year-old son, Shamita says that she is taking it easy waiting for the right man to come in her life.Ask her if she ever gets pressured by her mother, Shamita says, I wont call it pressure. Every parent wants to see their child settle down. And initially, after I lost my dad, mom would be worried and all the focus comes on the other child, naturally. But I dont really stress about it that much.What does Shilpa have to say about this Shamita quips, She is not concerned anymore now. Shes kind of understood that I need to find my own way, so she doesnt pester me. [Also] When these things have to happen, they just happen. My doors are very much open, but honestly, I havent found anyone that I can spend the rest of my life with.

Its scary what you see out there. People are in marriages and still doing their own things on the side. They dont respect their partners enough and dont hold onto relationships the way it was in the past, she says.I dont believe in falling in love today, getting married and if it doesnt work, you go your own way. Its not about that for me.The actor adds that marriage is sacred for her. I dont believe in falling in love today, getting married and if it doesnt work, you go your own way. Its not about that for me. I want a companion whom I am going to be happy with. And I dont mind if the person comes in my life at a later stage, even when I am 40 or 50. Im not going to sit and stress over it or plan things out, says Shamita adding that she wont prefer an actor as her life partner.So whos the ideal guy for Shamita that she would want to spend her life with  He has to be someone who can make me laugh and has a drive and passion for whatever he does in his life. I cant handle dishonesty; I like integrity in people and for me, thats very important in a man, says Shamita, adding that anyone who matches these criteria, she would want to know him better.Follow @htshowbiz for more
