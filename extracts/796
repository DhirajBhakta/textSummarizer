Never approached Sabbir to direct, write 'Dabangg 3': Arbaaz.
The makers of Dabangg 3 have been looking for a director for a long time. There were reports that Prabhudheva has been approached for the film, and in fact, he has agreed to take the cop caper forward. But things took a different turn when Sabbir Khan of Baaghi fame revealed that he will direct the third instalment of the popular franchise. In an interview to Mumbai Mirror, the filmmaker claimed that he has already started working on the script. He told the daily, "Yes, I've started working on a plan for Dabangg 3 but I can't say anything until the paperwork is finalised. I am in talks and am really happy that I was one of directors selected to work on the final script." A few hours after the news went viral, producer Arbaaz Khan took to Twitter to rubbish the report. He wrote, "Sabir khan was never approached to direct or write Dabangg 3. His statement in Mumbai Mirror is untrue and rubbish. Extremely disappointing (sic)".Sabir khan was never approached to direct or write Dabangg 3. His statement in Mumbai Mirror is untrue and rubbish.
