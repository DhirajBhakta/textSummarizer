We are obsessed with selfie culture: Kalki Koechlin.
The next time you spot actor Kalki Koechlin, don?t ask her for a selfie. The actor is apparently fed up of fans coming to her with the phone cameras in selfie mode. She adds that she would rather prefer talking to them. ?This trend of taking selfies is really extreme. I wish people were more keen to talk to you, instead of taking a selfie. We are obsessed with this selfie culture. I wish people would have a chat with me. That would be so much better,? says Kalki, who was last seen in actor Konkona Sen Sharma?s directorial debut A Death in the Gunj.Fans are a big part of an actor?s life and they often look up to their favourite stars. However, when it comes to socially relevant topics, Kalki feels that it?s unfair to expect only the film industry to bring about a change.She explains the same with an example: ?For instance, the fairness cream debate... it?s one thing for actors to speak up. We need advertisers, magazines, TV channels, even our newspapers to speak up. Everyone is guilty of endorsing fairness creams as much as actors. It?s easy for people to wait for actors to make the change. It has to be a collective decision, which needs to come from everyone. Fairness creams are an extreme example. We need to change our ideas about a beautiful woman. We still feel that they need to have a certain age and body type.? Follow @htshowbiz for more
