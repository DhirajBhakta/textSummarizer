Maharashtra farmers can fill loan waiver forms on mobile app.
The Maharashtra government plans to launch a mobile app where farmers can fill their loan waiver forms.Around 89 lakh farmers, who will benefit from the farm loan waiver of Rs34,022 crore announced last month, are expected to fill their personal and loan-related details in the forms. The app will have a two-page form in which the farmers will have to put their personal details, including name, PAN and Aadhaar numbers, details of the loans they have taken and a declaration that the applicant is eligible for the loan waiver. It will also have details of loan waiver schemes, nearest service centres and schemes launched for farmers.Read:  Maharashtra farm loan waiver will help BJP but leave state finances in tattersThe government has urged legislators to help farmers in their constituencies to fill the forms online, through mobile app or offline so the process is completed at the earliest. ?The app will be launched in the next couple of days. Besides, we have 26,000 service centres at village levels where farmers can fill the forms. Forms filled offline will be uploaded by the government staff at the centres,? said chief minister Devendra Fadnavis. The government has made KYC linking mandatory to avoid misappropriation which was witnessed during loan waiver given in 2008-09.
