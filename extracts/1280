Dressing like men causes PCOS: College principal tells girls.
Eve-teasing, molestation and rape are sensitive issues in our nation but the way 'authorities' handle these issues is appalling sometimes. From orthodox thinking to the way a woman is dressed up, all kinds of unnecessary reasons are given as causes. Nonetheless, actions must be taken to prevent these shameful acts and that is exactly what a Mumbai college wanted to do, not. A list of do's and don'ts was released by a Mumbai college recently and apart from shocking everyone, it has invited mockery at a large scale.Government Polytechnic College in Bandra has finally found a way to avoid eve-teasing by separating the seating areas of girls and boys in the canteen area and slapping a dress code on the girls studying in the college. According to the college administration, girls should dress up in 'suitable' clothes as it will help the girls to "not think like men" and "lose the urge to reproduce at later stage in life". Not only this, the Principle who is a woman herself said that PCOS, polycystic ovarian syndrome is caused when girls dress up like men. According to her, wearing clothes like men causes gender reversals in their heads and reduces the urge to reproduce.The thoughtless comment enraged many as it doesn't makes sense, scientifically, or even logically and only encourages a sexist approach towards the situation of women in India.
