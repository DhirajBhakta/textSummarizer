Their membership from the party has been cancelled. We have also ordered an inquiry into the incident,? read a press statement from the group?s national media convener Saket Bahuguna.?We will co-ordinate with the police and demand strict action against them.?The two expelled ABVP members are accused of beating up Aman Sinha, a student of Jawaharlal Nehru University and a member of the left-leaning All India Students Association, and two others near Patel Chest Institute in north campus.The alleged attack came towards the end of a march that saw hundreds of students and teachers from various colleges and universities hit the streets to protest against campus violence. Several political leaders and student political groups joined the protest.The university has been simmering for a week after ABVP members refused to allow JNU students Umar Khalid and Shehla Rashid from speaking at a seminar in Ramjas College. Soon after, clashes broke out between the ABVP and other parties ? with many students thrashed in the melee that followed.Delhi Police was also accused of beating up students and journalists and giving ABVP members a free hand. Hours after the clash last Wednesday, police registered a case and transferred it to the crime branch. Three police officers were also suspended for attacking journalists and students.
