Even Allah doesn't want impure mosque in Ayodhya: RSS.
Senior Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) ideologue Indresh Kumar on Saturday said that Muslims in India have understood that even Allah doesn't want an 'impure' mosque at the disputed site in Ayodhya.Speaking to India Today, the veteran RSS functionary and convener of its minority cell - Muslim Rashtriya Manch said, "Muslims have realised that since Allah himself has not allowed the mosque to come up there, it's unlikely that it will ever come up."Questioning the legitimacy of the Babri Masjid, Kumar said that the 15th century structure was named after an individual (Babur) and so it could never be used by Muslims as they only worshiped one God."The land is disputed and it was claimed after destroying a Ram temple that existed there, thus Allah never accepted the structure and even namaz was never conducted at the place. Today, Muslims have realized that it was an illegal structure," he explained.Going back in time, the veteran RSS ideologue blamed the dispute on a mistake by Babur, the founder of the Mughal dynasty in the subcontinent. TRY BABUR IN COURT "The Ram Mandir in Ayodhya was destroyed by Babur 400 years ago. Had he not indulged in that act to build such an impure mosque, there would not have been such a predicament today. I would like to appeal to the courts of the land that if someone needs to be tried it should be Babur and his army general Mir Baqi," he added.At a time when the RSS backed Muslim Rashtriya Manch is backing the call for a Ram Mandir at Ayodhya, Kumar said that many in the community have stated that they don't want an 'illegal' mosque, especially one that was built on a disputed land."They (Muslims) have realised that Ram and Khuda are all the same, they are one supreme power. The only difference being that one is abstract and the other takes the form of Lord Ram," he added.According to Kumar, the minority community in India now realises that those who are trying to encroach the land forcefully were neither following the principles of Quran nor the Prophet, but were only interested in continuing the stalemate."They believe that Ram is like their Nabi or Paigambar and most definitely that of their ancestors, thus they want a Ram Temple in Ayodhya to end the dispute forever. They have understood that even though they may be Muslims by faith but in Hindustan their ancestors were all Hindus and their social and domestic customs too were that of the Hindus," Kumar said.Also read:Babri Masjid demolition: Supreme Court restores conspiracy charges against LK Advani, MM Joshi, Uma Bharti
