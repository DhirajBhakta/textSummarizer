I debuted in 2004, was given the captaincy in 2007. If I see my journey since then, I had to change according to the team's needs. I started in the lower order then moved up the ladder. My batting order was never fixed. I used to get batting for 25-30 overs. However, it changed in the last few years."The top-order batsmen batted really well and I felt there was no explosive finisher at the lower order and due to that I was batting lower down the order. Over the years, I changed my batting order according to the team's requirements. I am ready to change my batting order according to the responsibility given to me in the times ahead," Dhoni said at the conference which was held in Pune ahead of India's first ODI against England on January 15.
