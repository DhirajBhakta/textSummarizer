Indian royal families to present traditional cuisine.
We have always been fascinated by the erstwhile Indian royal families as well as their present day descendants. Besides their opulent lifestyle and diverse cultural heritage, tales of royal repast often include mention of secret recipes, family favourites and a rich culinary repertoire. Here's some good news: We will soon have an opportunity to 'Dine with Royalty' during a three-day grand event organized by eatwithIndia, the group synonymous with promoting regional Indian cuisine by curating unique dining experiences, mostly at homes of people who are proud to showcase their family food.  Scheduled for October 2017, Dine with Royalty will have 20 royal families presenting their cuisines in the capital during the first festival of its kind. Six luxury tents would be set up, each representing the heritage of a princely state where members of different royal families will play host during the meal.

There will also be special performances by local artistes of each region to make the entire experience more special. To maintain the intimacy of the experience all the event tickets will be pre-booked, and no walk-ins will be entertained.   The curtain raiser for the forthcoming festival was recently held at the Embassy of Belgium. The evening started with a panel discussion by stalwarts of culinary history including Pushpesh Pant, food historian, Neha Prasada, author of 'Dining with the Maharajas: A Thousand Years of Culinary Tradition', Nawab Kazim Ali Khan, Nawab of Rampur, Tikaraj Aishwarya Chandra Katoch, 489th descendant of the royal Katoch clan, eminent food writer Sourish Bhattacharya and Sonal Saxena, co-founder eatwithIndia. This was followed by a mesmerizing qawwali performance by the Nizami Brothers. The highlight of the evening, as expected, was the food!
