SC sends notice to Facebook and WhatsApp over privacy issues.
The Supreme Court on Monday issued notices to Centre, Facebook, WhatsApp and TRAI on a plea that sought government regulation of the online messaging services. The issue raised in the petition concern the new privacy policy of WhatsApp under which the app can share data with the parent organisation Facebook. This, petition alleges, may amount to invasion of privacy of individuals.Delhi HC had earlier denied any relief and refuse to interfere with the policy of Facebook and WhatsApp. Replies to the notices issued on Monday have to be filed in two weeks, after which further hearing will take place.
