Caste-based reservation should end: RSS .
RSS leader Manmohan Vaidya has stirred a fresh controversy by questioning the caste based reservation in jobs."The caste-based reservation should end at some point. Dr Ambedkar said that such a reservation policy is not good for any country if it continues perpetually. This should end and a time must come when everyone should get more job opportunities," said Vaidya while speaking at the Jaipur Literature Festival today.Sensing trouble over his remarks, fellow RSS leader Dattareya Hosabole tried to contain the damage saying, "What Manmohan Vaidya meant was that till there is discrimination against certain population groups, and equal opportunity is not provided to all, caste-based reservation should continue."
