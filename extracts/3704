We all know that Karisma Kapoor's ex-husband Sunjay Kapur recently married longtime girlfriend Priya Sachdev. Rumours were doing the rounds that Karisma is also ready to walk down the aisle with her boyfriend Sandeep Toshniwal. However, the actor's father, Randhir Kapoor dismissed reports that Lolo is getting married.He told DNA, "I think Lolo is very well settled and happy. I have never discussed the issue of marriage with her but if she does plan to, she will always have my blessings. But I don't think she wants to get married. She is a happy mother and if she wants, she can get married any time but there is no step in that direction right now. She is happy the way she is. Lolo is an excellent mother who dotes on her children and probably doesn't feel the need to get married."For the last few months, speculation is rife that Karisma and Sandeep are ready to take their relationship to the next level. The actor was clicked wearing a huge ring, sparking rumours that she got secretly engaged. It is also being said that the two have finalised an apartment to move in together.
