She also said, ''Our marriage was not consummated due to impotency and congenital defects. He behaves like a woman. He goes to work in the day and comes home and wears sari at night.''The couple had an arranged marriage one year ago.Saraswathi, senior councellor at Vanitha Sahayavani, a woman's helpline run by the city police, said, ''But from their first night itself, Naveen would act like a woman. He wanted to wear a sari that night.'' Anitha finally decided to seek divorce to put an end to her marriage after she realised that her husband was only interested in having "lesbian sex" with her.
