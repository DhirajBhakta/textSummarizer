Fugu contains lethal amounts of the poison tetrodotoxin in its inner organs, especially the liver, ovaries, and the eyes; the skin is usually non-poisonous.5. The poison in Fugu paralyzes the muscles while the victim stays fully conscious. The poisoned victim is not able to breathe, and eventually dies from asphyxiation.6. According to Wikipedia, Fugu poison is 1200 times stronger than cyanide, and has no known antidote yet.
