Har ek ka dil hai Hindustani, says Mukesh Ambani.
Mumbai, Mar 18 (PTI) Days after terming the protectionist bent of the Donald Trump regime as a "blessing in disguise", Reliance Industries chairman Mukesh Ambani today said its "high time" we promoted reverse brain-drain wherein our brightest talent come back and serve the homeland. "Its high time that our brightest and the best work for the benefit of India and Indians," Ambani said. When asked whether he sees a reverse brain-drain, he quipped "without doubt". "By whatever fate they are brought back to this country, they can help improve the lives of 1.3 billion citizens and put together a new developmental model...there cannot be a better blessing in disguise than that," Ambani told the India Today conclave here. He said of late RIL is getting many Indians who have held leadership roles in other countries in the past. RIL is getting at least two-three such talent every month, he said. "We have more talent knocking at our doors because at the end of the day, har ek ka dil hain Hindustani. People want to do things for India," he said. Addressing the annual Nasscom summit here last month, Ambani had said the Trump administrations protectionist policies like limiting the number of H1B visas, could prove to be a blessing in disguise for the country. "Trump can actually be a blessing in disguise. Our IT industry can focus on solving the problems right here, which is a huge market," he had said in a stance which was seen as contrary to the prevailing atmosphere of paranoia and fear about the future. Ambani today said we are fortunate to be an open market with a leader who understands technology. He recalled how Prime Minister Narendra Modi spent an entire dinner meeting with the last American president Barack Obama discussing how technology could resolve many of the problems the world is seeped in.
