HC to hear fresh appeals of Talwars in Aarushi murder case.
Allahabad, Aug 01 (PTI) The Allahabad High Court today said it would hear afresh the appeals filed by Rajesh and Nupur Talwar challenging their conviction in the murder of their daughter Aarushi and domestic help Hemraj, seven months after reserving its judgement in the matter. A division bench comprising Justices Bala Krishna Narayana and Arvind Kumar Mishra said it would hear the matter again due to "contradictions" in some submissions made by the CBI in the sensational murder case and fixed August 31 for resuming the hearing. The court had on January 11 last reserved its judgement on the appeals filed by the Noida-based dentist couple who were awarded life imprisonment by a special CBI court at Ghaziabad on November 26, 2013.
