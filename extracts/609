Several shopkeepers had to be shifted after the redevelopment plan was conceived in 2006. It led to a long drawn legal battle between the NDMC and local traders until the Supreme Court passed an order in NDMC?s favour in 2013. The structure was declared unsafe in 2007. ?They have been saying this for the past several years. They were supposed to complete the renovation before the Common Wealth Games. It was only because of this renovation that all the shopkeepers had to shift. Some of the shop keepers were doing business since the 1940s,? said Ravi Kant Jain, officiating secretary of the Gole Market Traders Association. ?The purpose of conservation of this building is not to freeze its current status but to adopt it to a modern use of modern facilities sensitively,? said Kumar.
