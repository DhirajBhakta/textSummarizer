Rajinikanth has committed financial fraud: Swamy.
BJP leader Subramanian Swamy told India Today that Rajinikanth should not join politics because it will be hard for him to continue because of financial irregularities surrounding the superstar. Swamy was pressed by India Today's Rahul Kanwal on whether he was absolutely sure of his allegations against Rajinikanth."Rajinikanth's famous dialogue is 'If I say it once, it is equivalent to saying it hundred times' (Naan oru thadava sonna, nooru thadava sonna madhiri)," said Swamy, who's personally known to the superstar."If he comes there will be many things that will tumble out which will be harmful to him. I would advise him not to come [to politics]," Swamy told India Today. The BJP leader also said the 'Superstar' was "unfit for any political work."Rajinikanth had earlier said he was discussing the prospects of his joining politics, but would make an announcement once he took a decision."I have not denied it. We are discussing and yet to take a decision. Once I take a decision I will inform you", he said.Last month, the veteran actor had asked his fans to "prepare for war," hinting that he might consider entering politics.ALSO READ | Rajinikanth admits discussing his entry into politics
