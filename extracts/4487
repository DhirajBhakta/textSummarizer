Did not overcharge patients for stents, says Max Healthcare.
New Delhi/Mumbai, Feb 24 (PTI) Max Healthcare and Lilavati Hospital today denied overcharging patients for stents and insisted they were complying with NPPA guidelines on pricing of the medical device. "We have not overcharged even a single patient for stent. We have complied fully and immediately with the NPPA order on stent pricing," a Max Healthcare official said in response to queries by PTI. The companys healthcare facility at Saket in South Delhi is among the hospitals which have been issued show cause notices by the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) after preliminary investigations over stents pricing. "We are positive that we will be able to demonstrate our compliance to NPPA order on the ceiling price of coronary stent," the official added. Similarly, Lilavati Hospitals Medical Superintendent Sitaram Gawde said: "We are not overcharging. We are following the government guidelines on pricing. We are yet to receive any communication from the NPPA." The NPPA had earlier said it had issued show cause notices to some hospitals over pricing of stents. "After preliminary investigations, show cause notices issued to Max, Saket, New Delhi and Nidaan Multispeciality Hospital, Sonepat, Haryana," NPPA had said in a tweet. The regulator had also said it was investigating overpricing complaints against hospitals, including Lilavati Hospital (Mumbai), Max Saket (New Delhi), Metro Hospital (Faridabad), PGI Chandigarh, Ram Murti Hospital (Bareilly), and has alerted the concerned State Drug Controllers. Comments from the other hospitals could not be immediately obtained. NPPA had yesterday warned hospitals, stent manufacturers and importers of legal action in case they are found spreading "misinformation" about shortage of stents in the wake of price cap.
