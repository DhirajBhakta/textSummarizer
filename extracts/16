That?s what this whole case is all about,? he said.Hussain had garnered much attention before arriving in the US for the snowshoe championship after the US Embassy in New Delhi had denied him and another athlete visas around the same time President Donald Trump had issued an order barring travel into the US from seven Muslim-dominant countries.While India was not among the seven countries, the denial of visa to Hussain and the other athlete was seen associated with the executive order.
