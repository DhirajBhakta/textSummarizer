Buggy used by Presidents was won over a coin toss with Pak.
Ditching a lavish car, brand-new Indian President Ram Nath Kovind took the historic buggy ride from Rashtrapati Bhavan to Parliament for his the oath-taking ceremony today.Outgoing President Pranab Mukherjee was seated on the left side of the buggy and the new president on his right. On their way back, once Kovind has taken his oath, the two will exchange seats, leaving Mukherjee on the right and Kovind on the left.This buggy has interesting history at its tail. Here's where it comes from:WHERE DID THE BUGGY COME FROMThe gold-plated, horse-drawn buggy originally belonged to the Viceroy of India during the British era. How it remained in India after Independence is a story that will make many happy.After the partition, both India and Pakistan wanted the fancy buggy, and there was no longer a higher power to sort this quarrel. So, what did they do to sort the disputeSimple. They did what cricket captains do these days. They tossed.Lt Col Thakur Govind Singh from India and Pakistan Army's Sahabzada Yaqub Khan let the responsibility of the buggy ownership rest on a coin.Guess who won the tossOf course, India did. And here we are, after all these years, still using the old gal to flaunt around our newly-elected presidents.BUGGY'S USEAfter 1984, the buggy was not frequently used by any president for a few decades. While they did use it now and then, it was properly used again in 2014 by Pranab Mukherjee.Earlier, the gold-plated buggy was used by the president not only for ceremonial purposes, but also to move around in his 320-acre residential space.
