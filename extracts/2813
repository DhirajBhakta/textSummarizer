Bankrupt former tennis star's Porsche, Maserati towed away.
Just days after being declared bankrupt, Boris Becker suffered another blow when his cars were towed from outside a private club in London earlier this week.According to a report in the Daily Mail, Becker has been slapped with two parking tickets after he left his Porsche Cayenne GTS and his Electric Blue Maserati GHIBLI S outside his South Kensington private member's club.The former German tennis star Becker was declared bankrupt by a court in London after failing to pay a "substantial" long-standing debt since 2015.Lawyers for the the three-time Wimbledon champion pleaded with a Bankruptcy Court registrar last week to allow Becker a "last chance" to pay off the debt.But Registrar Christine Derrett, who recalled watching Becker play on Centre Court, ruled there was a lack of credible evidence the outstanding payment would be forthcoming and refused to adjourn the case."One has the impression of a man with his head in the sand," she said of the six-time major winner after making the bankruptcy order following a brief hearing.The bankruptcy application was made by private bankers Arbuthnot Latham and Co. in connection with a judgment debt owed them by Becker dating back to 2015.The German's lawyers had argued there was sufficient evidence to show that he would be able to pay the debt soon through a refinancing arrangement, involving remortgaging a property in Mallorca, which was expected to raise six million euros (6.7 million).His advocate told the registrar his instructions from Becker were that it was expected the deal would be approved by a Spanish bank in approximately one month.Becker's advocate said his client was not likely to benefit from bankruptcy and it could have an adverse effect on his "image".
