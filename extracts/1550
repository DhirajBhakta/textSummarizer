NSG membership is not farewell gift: China slams Obama govt.
China today voiced its displeasure at the United States and at the outgoing Barack Obama administration for suggesting Beijing was blocking India's Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) bid, saying the matter was not "a farewell gift" to be given by Washington."I just want to point out that NSG membership is not some kind of farewell gift for countries to give to each other," Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying told a press briefing, adding that she would not reiterate China's stand on the issue of non-NPT (Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty) countries joining the elite group. Beijing has said that the group first needs to agree general criteria for all non-NPT countries before considering India's case.MUST READ: NSG entry: How China stonewalled IndiaThe US Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asia in the outgoing Obama administration, Nisha Biswal, said on Sunday that China was an "outlier" preventing India's entry.The Obama administration had hoped to push India's bid through before the end of its term.
