Talking about the harrowing experience, she said, From July 24, I started getting calls from random numbers, many among them being Mumbai numbers too. They called me non-stop. I changed my handset too. Usually, I dont take a call from an unknown number. But once I answered... he started talking nonsense and filth, it took me seconds to react. I was literally frozen. And after a few minutes, I was just angry and fired him. And after that, there was a marathon of calls. I was tired of answering the calls. A day later, he called again and I fired him and he abused me in Marathi. When the calls didnt stop coming, she decided to approach the police.The 37-year-old actor began her tinsel town journey with a special song in Ram Gopal Varmas Road (2009) called Khullam Khulla.
