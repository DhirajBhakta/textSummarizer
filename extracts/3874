Kim Sharma bankrupt after separation from husband: Reports.
Mohabbatein girl Kim Sharma disappeared from the spotlight when she married business tycoon Ali Punjani in 2010 and moved to Kenya. Recently, her return to Mumbai sparked rumours of trouble in paradise. According to a report in DNA, Kim's marriage is over because her husband left her for another woman.A source is quoted as telling the publication, "Ali left Kim as he got attracted to another woman. The irony is that when Ali met Kim, he was plump and not great-looking but now because he is in love, he has lost weight and looking great. But Kim is left with no money or financial security. Right now, she is looking to establish her business in Mumbai to provide for herself financially. She is now a brand strategist and goes by the name Kimi Sharma (her real name). Kimi didn't just leave their home in Kenya behind, but her job as the CEO of Punjani's chain of hotels as well."Interestingly, ever since her return, Kim has been linked to menswear designer Arjun Khanna and has even been clicked with him on several occasions. Reportedly, Arjun's growing proximity to Kim is the reason why his marriage with wife Shefalee is on the rocks. Rumour has it that Arjun and Shefalee have been living separately ever since she realised that her husband had lost all interest in her.
