FIFA to shift India's U-17 WC games from Mumbai  to Delhi.
FIFA is set to shift India's Under-17 World Cup matches from Mumbai to the national capital Delhi as the apex soccer body has taken the host governments request "very seriously". The All India Football Federation (AIFF) initially wanted Mumbai to host India's home matches but later asked FIFA to shift them to Delhi due to pressure from the sports ministry as it felt it was appropriate that the capital hosts the home teams games. Asked if they have finalised on shifting India's round robin matches from Mumbai to Delhi, FIFAs head of events Jaime Yarza told PTI, "We are working on the most beneficial decision for the tournament. We take the requests from the Indian Government very seriously, as its our main partner in the organisation of the FIFA U-17 World Cup." As hosts, India would normally be placed in Group A and will be the number one team - A1 - in the four-team group. Navi Mumbai was originally scheduled to host Group A matches but the AIFFs request means Delhi could now host those while Navi Mumbai will have to settle for Group B games. A source, in the know of the developments, said FIFA is "very close" to shift the matches. "Together with the AIFF and the Government, this world cup will change the future of football in India. We are convinced to reach a decision which will satisfy all parties," Yarza said. The first FIFA event in India will be held across six Indian cities from October 6 to 28. Though he did not reveal the names, Yarza said at least two top players will be present on the the day of the official draw in Mumbai on July 7. "Well, we cannot spoil the fun for the fans. We will have two top players for the official draw on the 7th July, as well as some other appearances until the start of the tournament.
