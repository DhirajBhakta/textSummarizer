						Netflix has a bizarre aversion to supporting theatrical films. They have this mindless policy of everything having to be simultaneously streamed and released, which is obviously an untenable model for theatrical presentation.So theyre not even getting in the game, and I think theyre missing a huge opportunity, Nolan said.The director said Netflix is being used as a kind of way to shut down cinemas.I think the investment that Netflix is putting into interesting filmmakers and interesting projects would be more admirable if it werent being used as some kind of bizarre leverage against shutting down theatres. Its so pointless. I dont really get it, he added. Follow @htshowbiz for more
