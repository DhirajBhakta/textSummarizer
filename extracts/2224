Oscar-winning actor Martin Landau passes away aged 89.
Martin Landau, the chameleon-like actor who gained fame as the crafty master of disguise in the 1960s TV show Mission: Impossible, then capped a long and versatile career with an Oscar for his poignant portrayal of aging horror movie star Bela Lugosi in 1994?s Ed Wood, has died. He was 89.Landau died Saturday of unexpected complications during a short stay at UCLA Medical Centre, his publicist Dick Guttman said.Mission: Impossible, which also starred Landau?s wife, Barbara Bain, became an immediate hit upon its debut in 1966. It remained on the air until 1973, but Landau and Bain left at the end of the show?s third season amid a financial dispute with the producers. They starred in the British-made sci-fi series Space: 1999 from 1975 to 1977.Academy award winning actor Martin Landau sits on his new star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, as he poses for photographers during ceremonies to honour him, in Hollywood, December 17, 2001.

						Landau might have been a superstar but for a role he didn?t play - the pointy-eared starship Enterprise science officer, Mr. Spock. Star Trek creator Gene Rodenberry had offered him the half-Vulcan, half-human who attempts to rid his life of all emotion. Landau turned it down.?A character without emotions would have driven me crazy; I would have had to be lobotomized,? he explained in 2001. Instead, he chose Mission: Impossible, and Leonard Nimoy went on to everlasting fame as Spock.Ironically, Nimoy replaced Landau on Mission: Impossible.After a brief but impressive Broadway career, Landau had made an auspicious film debut in the late 1950s, playing a soldier in Pork Chop Hill and a villain in the Alfred Hitchcock classic North By Northwest.He enjoyed far less success after Mission: Impossible, however, finding he had been typecast as Rollin Hand, the top-secret mission team?s disguise wizard. His film career languished for more than a decade, reaching its nadir with his appearance in the 1981 TV movie The Harlem Globetrotters on Gilligan?s Island.Actor Martin Landau holds the Screen Actors Guild Award he won for outstanding performance by a male actor in a supporting role for his role in the film Ed Wood at the first-ever televised awards show for the organization in Los Angeles.

Landau said after accepting his Oscar.In Ed Wood, he portrayed Lugosi during his final years, when the Hungarian-born actor who had become famous as Count Dracula was ill, addicted to drugs and forced to make films with Ed Wood just to pay his bills.

						?I watched about 35 Lugosi movies, including ones that were worse than anything Ed Wood ever made,? he recalled in 2001. ?Despite the trash, he had a certain dignity about him, whatever the role.?So did the New York-born Landau, who had studied drawing at the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn and worked for a time as a New York Daily News cartoonist before switching careers at age 22.He had dabbled in acting before the switch, making his stage debut in 1951 at a Maine summer theatre in Detective Story and off-Broadway in First Love.In 1955, he was among hundreds who applied to study at the prestigious Actors Studio and one of only two selected.
