Let AAP, Cong explain how they won earlier with EVMs: Shah.
On a day when the Bharatiya Janata Party swept the municipal elections in the capital, party chief Amit Shah slammed Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal over allegations of faulty electronic voting machines (EVMs)."Let Kejriwal first tell the public how he won in Delhi in 2015 with these same EVMs when the BJP was at the centre in 2015," Shah told media persons in Kolkata."UPA one and two had also won elections with the same EVMs. If EVM machines are faulty then how did they win earlier? I think they should accept the verdict with the right spirit," he added.On his second day of a three day trip to West Bengal, the BJP chief reached Kolkata from north Bengal in a train on Wednesday morning. Later he met booth level party workers at chief minister Mamata Banerjee's Banwanipur constituency and went on a door-to-door campaign as part of BJP's massive outreach programme in Bengal.Attacking the state government over a host of issues, Shah was particularly vocal about Mamata's "appeasement" politics. "The administration in Bengal has been communalised and that's why such (communal) incidents are taking place. If there was no appeasement this would not have be the case," Shah said in response to the spike in communal flare-ups in the state.He also added that no one from the TMC were in touch with BJP in response to the Trinamool supremo's allegation that BJP was trying to break her party using central agencies.On the issue of Gau Rakshaks, Shah said his party had given a clear message that no one should take law in their own hands. "Cases have been registered and people are being arrested," Shah claimed.Responding to the  criticism that Sukma attack proved demonetisation has had no impact on the Maoists, as claimed by the Modi government earlier, Shah said, "One can't judge the impact from just one incident. Naxalism has come down substantially across the country under the BJP rule, their morale has been broken.""Look who are questioning us...those under whose rule they (Naxals) grew strong. Left wing extremism gained prominence under the Congress regime," he said slamming the Congress and the Left.Watch Video: MCD election 2017: Amit Shah credits PM Modi's leadership for BJP's victory in civic polls
