Opp'n should stop bayanbaazi, BJP will win big in 2019: Shah.
Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president Amit Shah is one man who seems to be on an unending mission. After heading the party to tremendous victory in Uttar Pradesh Assembly election and Delhi MCD polls, the BJP president has already set his eyes on the 2019 Lok Sabha election.In an exclusive interview to India Today, Amit Shah appeared confident of BJP's win the 2019 general elections and slammed the Opposition for trying to stall Modi government's development agenda."We are working together with Modiji who is working tirelessly for the people of country. The Opposition should also start working instead of doing bayanbaazi. The BJP will return to power with a bigger mandate in 2019," Amit Shah said.  The BJP chief also slammed Aam Aadmi Party national convener Arvind Kejriwal for making baseless charge about Electronic Voting Machine (EVM) rigging in recent Assembly elections."It is easy to make baseless allegations but very hard to perform on the ground. Our party cadres have worked tirelessly on the grass root level to get the results that we have seen in the recent past," he said.  "The BJP is working on an expansion mode and we believe that we can win," the BJP chief added. HERE'S WHAT AMIT SHAH SAID: ON TRIPLE TALAQ: ON COW VIGILANTISM: ON SUKMA NAXAL ATTACK: ON SARADHA SCAM: The CBI didn't take action on directions of the Modi government. The central agency is doing what the Supreme Court and Calcutta High Court asked it to do.Trinamool Congress leaders were caught on camera receiving money. How can they deny that Saradha scam has been in news for the past two and half years but no action was taken against culprits. The BJP is here to highlight corruption. Being the CM of West Bengal and TMC chief, tt was Mamata Bannerjee's responsibility to curb corruption.
