I love making love not seeing it, jokes Shah Rukh Khan.
Shah Rukh Khan is not called the ?King of Romance? for nothing. The Jab Harry Met Sejal actor, who just has to give that melting look to make women go weak-kneed, is witty as hell too. At the launch of film?s new song Hawayein, SRK?asked the permission of media before he shared a controversial thought. Then he said it anyway, ?Ek controversial baat bolun, I love making love and not seeing it.?The 51-year-old actor also shared that he loves to watch romantic movie just because of his daughter, Suhana. SRK has also spoken about Suhana and how she loves watching romantic films.The actor, who is playing the role of a tourist guide named Harry in ?Jab Harry met Sejal?, also believes that there is ?Harry? in everyone one of us.?There is lot of ?us? in different ways in Harry. There were many moments, when we used to talk and think that similar things have happened with us at different stages of our lives. Obviously when you play a character, the space is different, setting is different maybe you have been not there, but feelings are familiar,? noted Khan.Watch: Jab Harry Met Sejal?s song Hawayein starring Shah Rukh Khan and Anushka SharmaSejal, tere hi liye saari wafayein... #Hawayein #JHMSAug4 @AnushkaSharma @RedChilliesEnt @sonymusicindia https://t.co/uMUT8E6hLu?
