The height of the dam was increased by the irrigation department last year, owing to which the water stock is much more now.Last week, the dams providing water to Mumbai had overflown but the ones in Thane district were yet to reach their capacity. The Barvi and Andra dams are the two major sources of water supply in Thane district. Andra  filled upto 63.64%. The irrigation department said that the water level at Barvi was the highest till the month of July in the past five years.An officer said, ?The Barvi dam usually fills by the end of October, however, last year it filled by the end of August. This year, the dam is almost full in July and we still have over 45 days of monsoon left. Water is now flowing from the spillway. The water stock will ensure that only nominal water cuts of 5 to 10% will be imposed in the summer, which will not hurt residents.?The water stock in Barvi dam was only 115.04 mcm. The average water stock in Barvi for the last five years is 85.19 mcm, which is much lower than the stock this year. The catchment area has received 1,638mm rainfall.
