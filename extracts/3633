Poster of Ayushmann's film on erectile dysfunction unveiled.
Two years ago, Ayushmann Khurrana and Bhumi Pednekar gave film enthusiasts one of the finest Bollywood films of the recent times. And the hit-jodi is set to reunite for another romantic comedy Shubh Mangal Saavdhan. It's been a month since the two began shooting for the film, and the makers have only added to the hype by sharing the first look poster. And it gets you all nostalgic. If you are a fan of Dum Laga Ke Haisha, you cannot wait enough to see the two of them together on screen once again.#ShubhMangalSaavdhan - 'stand up' for love.
