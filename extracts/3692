Sonam trolled for misquoting National Anthem.
Sonam Kapoor, always known to speak her mind, poured her heart out in a recent column for Hindustan Times. Sonam expressed her anguish at being trolled for questioning the status quo and sometimes, the government. The Neerja actor's column soon went viral, but for the wrong reason.One part of it read, "I'm a proud Indian. I love my country but for some of you - and you're the bigots, not me - I become 'anti-national' only because I ask questions or choose to be critical. Listen to the national anthem one more time. Recall the line you heard as kids, 'Hindu, Muslim, Sikh, Issai...'" Soon, Twitteratti began doing what they do best - trolling Sonam for misquoting the national anthem.Anil Kapoor after listening #SonamKapoor's version of National Anthem: pic.twitter.com/dg1wcRdbQuKids Love Alia BhattMen Love Rahul GandhiLegends Love Sonam KapoorFinally a competition for Alia & Rahulð#SonamKapoor#NationalAnthem@Atheist_Krishna National Anthem pata nahi aur chale National Award lene ðð #sonamkapoorHowever, Sonam retaliated by tweeting, "Thank you so much twitter for the amazing response to my article and also to the #trolls who proved my point by the way they responded."Thank you so much twitter for the amazing response to my article and also to the #trolls who proved my point by the way they responded ð¤â¤ð®ð³She also retweeted a Twitter user's tweet which said that the longer version of Jana Gana Mana actually had the line, "Hindu Bauddh Shikha Jain, Parasik Musolman Christaani."@India_Policy@sonamakapoor Actually, the second stanza of jana gana mana has the words "Hindu Bauddh Shikha Jain, Parasik Musolman Christaani". #NationalAnthempic.twitter.com/QvZXdbFPI3
