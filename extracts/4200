Jail has made Sanjay Dutt a changed man, and as it turns out, a poet as well.While the Munna Bhai actor was in Yerwada jail, he penned a number of poems, one of which called O Meri Aangan Ki Chidiya Hai Tu will be used in his upcoming film Torbaaz.Sanjay Dutt is playing an army officer in Torbaaz, directed by Girish Malik. The film set in Afghanistan is an action thriller and revolves around the phenomenon of young children being indoctrinated to think that there is glory awaiting in afterlife after killing for virtuous reasons. This is the first time an Indian film will deal with the theme of child soldiers.According to a report in Mumbai Mirror, the producer of Torbaaz got emotional when he heard the song O Meri Aangan Ki Chidiya Hai Tu at Sanjay Dutt's residence."Girish and I had gone to meet Sanju in Agra where he is filming Bhoomi. He hummed a few songs he had penned when he was in prison. He has a scratch version recorded and I was touched by one particular song. O Meri Aangan Ki Chidiya Hai Tu is about a father-daughter relationship. It's beautifully written and is relevant to our film as Sanju's character loses his child. I got very emotional when I heard it and told him we would like to use it in Torbaaz. He readily agreed," Torbaaz producer Rahul Mittra was quoted as saying.In fact, while he was in jail, Sanjay Dutt wrote songs across genres including some romantic numbers and qawwalis.Sanjay Dutt has previously lent his voice to a number of songs throughout his career. Some of the most popular ones are Aye Shivani from Khoobsurat, the title track of Chal Mere Bhai and Samjho Ho Hi Gaya from Lage Raho Munna Bhai.
