No time for a relationship, says Jhulan Goswami.
She may be an ace pacer but Jhulan Goswami is in no rush to engage in a romantic partnership at the moment. Indian star Goswami believes in doing just one thing at a time.?I am focusing on the game. I am so busy with it that I will not be able to devote time to anything else. If I can?t devote time to a relationship then I won?t be able to do justice to it. I would prefer to do one thing at a time,? Goswami told a television channel here on Saturday.READ?|?Mithali Raj reaches Hyderabad amid fanfare; CM awards plot and Rs 1 crore?I have seen my friends.... how they have had to struggle to balance two things at one time.
