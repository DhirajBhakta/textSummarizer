Rajasthan won't allow distorting Padmavati history: Minister.
The Karni Sena, who were in the limelight for their vicious attack on Padmavati director Sanjay Leela Bhansali, have received support from a senior BJP member and minister in the Vasundhara Raje government. Vasudev Devnani, the Minister for Education in Rajasthan, has expressed solidarity with the Karni Sena view and said that distortion of history will not be tolerated. "People of Rajasthan will not permit the distortion of the glorious history of Rani Padmavati. If someone does not want to shoot their film here, so be it," said Devnani.The Rajasthan government had been panned for the lack of any stringent action against the Karni Sena. A video showing the vicious attack on Sanjay Leela Bhansali and the vandalism carried out on the sets of Padmavati at Jaipur's Jaigarh Fort had gone viral. No FIR or formal police complaint was registered in the matter.However, the Rajasthan Home Minister and the state police had claimed that action will be taken if a formal complaint is made against the Karni Sena men. The Karni Sena, however, claimed it was Bhansali's bodyguards who opened fire on their men when they reached the sets of Padmavati, which led to the entire fracas. Bhansali had suspended the shooting and left for Mumbai soon after. Talks about compromise gathered pace as Bhansali's production unit and the Karni Sena tried finding common ground. The Karni Sena objected to any romantic scene being shown between Padmavati and Allauddin Khilji. However, the production house has insisted there is no romantic dream sequence or objectionable scene between Padmavati and Allauddin Khilji in the script.With the Rajasthan minister clearly expressing his viewpoint, the Karni Sena may feel further emboldened on the issue. It had earlier laid down its terms claiming no compromise will be allowed on the issue of Rajput honour.
