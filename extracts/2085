Crores of people have become victims of a visionless policy. It's a major catastrophe," Banerjee wrote on her Facebook page.Mamata took to social media to express her "deep sorrow" over the common man's ordeal and claimed that the Narendra Modi led central government's demonetization decision had "drastically affected about 5 Crore workers in the country". "According to reports, around 1.25 Crore workers in the country in unorganized sector, e-commerce, leather, jute, textiles, glass, beedi, gems and jewellery sectors and daily wage earners under government schemes like MNREGA have either lost jobs or have been seriously affected due to cash crunch," she added on Facebook.
