India should lower tariffs on Harley-Davidson motorbikes: US.
From Lalit K Jha Washington, Mar 23 (PTI) If India lowers the 100 per cent tariffs imposed on the popular American Harley Davidson motorcycles it could result in more foreign investments in the country, a top White House trade official has argued. "If India agrees to lower its tariffs on Harley Davidson motorcycles, Indian consumers will buy more Harleys and save less while Harley will sell more Harleys and invest more," Peter Navarro, Director of White House National Trade Council, said in a letter to the editor to The Wall Street Journal. "Truly fair and reciprocal trade between the US and its trading partners, rather than the perpetual turn of the screw we receive now, will lead to a thousand similar kinds of adjustments as our bilateral trade deficits fall and savings and investment patterns adjust," Navarro added in the letter published yesterday. He wrote the letter in response to the debate that his op-ed piece on March 6 in the daily had generated. He had argued that if the US uses leverage as the worlds largest market to "persuade" India to reduce its "notoriously high tariffs" America will surely sell more Harleys there. India imposes a 100-per cent import duty on the Amercian motorbikes, popular for a customisation that gave rise to the chopper-style motorcycles.
