Transformers and oil drums scrapped and dumped in junkyards for decades have suddenly found a new lease of life at the 'Energy Cafe' at Vidyut Bhawan, the headquarters of the Bihar State Electricity Board. Recently, a cafe has come up at the Vidyut Bhawan and interestingly, all the items used here for furnishing it are junk and scrapped material which have been collected from the energy department's junkyard. This Board office till now had one canteen for its staff in a dilapidated and unusable condition. However, Pratyaya Amrit, the incumbent Chairman of the Board hit open this novel idea to bring up a cafe using scrap material."The idea was conceptualized by our Board Chairman, Pratyaya Amrit six months back and he suggested that the reception area which was unused for years be† converted into a cafe for our staff members. The work was completed in record time and this caf√© which has been named aptly as 'Energy Cafe' was inaugurated last week ", said Mahfooz Hashmi, IT supervisor in the Board office.Also read: You can exchange a book for a meal at this Delhi University cafe So what are the scrapped items that have been used in a very innovative manner at this cafe Four oil drums have been re-modeled into three chairs and a centre table; the connection transformers have been reassembled into small stools; a control panel with nuts and bolts, used at power sub-stations, is recreated as a glass table; three kettles used at a thermal power plant in Karbigahiya years have been used to add to the vintage look at the cafe; wood of wheel cable roll has been used to create a menu display board, and a wall clock.
