Mumbai University results to be out by August after delays.
After weeks of speculation, University of Mumbai officials said they hope to announce the results of major examinations conducted earlier this year, by second week of August.  While they said they were happy with the pace at which papers were being assessed over the past few weeks, teachers are still complaining about technical glitches delaying the result.?Many teachers are still complaining that they receive answer booklets in Marathi instead of English. Though teachers are entitled to evaluating the answer sheets of three papers, some have only got the requisite codes for one. Even if they want a larger share of the workload, they cannot do it. Such glitches are hindering us from speeding up the process,? said the principal of a suburban college, who did not wish to be identified. He added that even with new central assessment process (CAP) centres being set up across the city, teachers are still finding it difficult to finish assessment work.MU is still receiving complaints from teachers, who said network problems are affecting the basic uploading of answer booklets daily. ?On some days, evaluating a single answer booklet can take up to an hour. Each page takes several minutes to upload, and only then can I assess them. It is frustrating,? said a professor, who did not wish to be identified. She said most teachers are still trying to work around these problems just to ensure that results are announced soon.Earlier this month, governor Ch Vidyasagar Rao had ordered MU to announce all results by July 31. However, this now seems unlikely.  ?Assessment work is going on well and we hope to announce the results of various courses by the end of this month. The results of courses which a large number of students have opted for will be announced a week later,? said an MU official.
