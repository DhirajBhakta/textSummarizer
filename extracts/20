Baby 'pregnant' with malformed twin born in Maharashtra.
In a bizarre medical condition, a newborn baby in Thane was found to be pregnant with his half-formed twin brother feeding off his blood supply. The condition, called fetus in fetu, is so rare that only about 100-200 such cases have been reported from all over the world till date. The boy was born to a 19-year old woman from Mumbra on July 20 at Bilal Hospital in Thane, near Mumbai.The 7cm foetus, weighing 150 gm and complete with a brain, arms and limbs, was found behind the babys stomach. A radiologist first spotted the abnormal mass during a routine scan of the pregnant mother.In post-natal scans, we spotted another half-formed baby with a brain, arm and legs in a foetal sac in the babys abdomen, radiologist Bhavna Thorat told German news agency DPA.After the baby was born, another scan found that the twin was feeding off his nutrition and posed a life threat.Doctors referred him to the Titan hospital in Thane, where the parasitic foetus was successfully removed by a specialist team of experts. It is suspected to be a rare congenital anomaly called fetus in fetu in which a malformed  foetus gets absorbed into the body of its twin.

As both the twins draw nutrients from a single umbilical chord, the chances of survival are usually low in such cases. It is a very rare condition and this is for the first time I have encountered such a case in my  entire medical career...  Both the baby and the mother are doing well, she added.
