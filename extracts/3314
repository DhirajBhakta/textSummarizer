Celebrities post pics to support Irani's #CottonIsCool look.
When you see the likes of Vijender Singh, Amish Tripathi, Kapil Dev and Vasundhara Raje posting pictures of themselves wearing kurtas/sarees, it does spike intrigue, quite naturally. On a closer look, we discover that these sports celebrities, politicians and authors are just part of a larger virtual wave started by our Minister of Textiles, Smriti Irani. Earlier today, Smriti posted a picture of herself dressed to the T in a saree, saying she depends on cotton to stay cool in the Indian summer, thus giving birth to the trend #CottonIsCool:I celebrate Indian summers and cotton industry with my #CottonIsCool look. What is your #CottonIsCool look?! pic.twitter.com/wnLcE8jQrxShe then prompted her friends and colleagues to take the wave forward, post pictures of themselves wearing cotton, and further tag 5 more friends to not break the chain. As a result, this happened:Cotton is a statement - comfortable, fashionable. #CottonIsCoolpic.twitter.com/ZAuPbYjXuXLike to be always Cool, but what you wear makes it much much easier to be cool.#CottonIsCool , really really cool. pic.twitter.com/ByZaC0icBENothing like fresh cottons to beat the heat I believe in staying cool even on the hottest days #CottonIsCoolpic.twitter.com/TOVqbD11KeTag your friends and show why #CottonIsCool! This is my in-the-mood-for-writing look! @GulPanag@AnupamPkher@shekharkapur@smritiiranipic.twitter.com/PDmYQN2VBrWhile it's delightful to see people of prominence flaunting Indian cotton with such pride, what's more important is that though Smriti Irani has commenced the wave--for good reason--it is up to us to carry it forward. Why must we? Because not only does cotton keep one cool in the summer, it also gives a big boost to Indian handloom and livelihood to weavers.So, we give you four solid reasons to ditch all other fabrics in the cruel Indian summer and wear cotton everyday:1. It keeps you cool in summers and warm in winters: Basically, cotton provides thermal insulation because the fabric traps air between fibres. Cotton fibres also keep the fabric away from the skin, letting even more air pass through, which helps with insulation.
