Mom gets call from school after kid takes vodka for lunch.
A woman hailing from Queensland, Australia, must have tried to get some rest after sending her five-year-old daughter to school, but when do mothers get to restShe received a concerned call from the school informing that her daughter had packed a Smirnoff raspberry vodka in her lunchbox. Earlier in the day, the mother had asked her little one to grab a pack of juice from the freezer but instead of juice, the 5-year-old grabbed vodka.  The mother realised the blunder but thankfully she did not get in trouble since the teachers assumed it was a genuine mistake of a five-year-old.Embarrassed and simultaneously realising the hilarity of the incident, the woman made a Facebook post about it, calling it an EPIC LUNCHBOX FAIL."EPIC lunchbox failâ¦when you tell your five-year-old Preppie to put a frozen juice pouch in her lunchbox and you forget the other pouches in your freezer!""I apologised for not sending enough for the teachers and they just laughed thankfully," she wrote, according to a Daily Dot report.
