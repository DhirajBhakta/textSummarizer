Kejriwal pulls up his health min over ventilators shortage.
New Delhi, Dec 11 (PTI) Following reports about shortage of ventilators in Delhi government-run hospitals, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal today pulled up Health Minister Satyendar Jain who in turn sought to shift the blame onto Lt Governor Najeeb Jung, accusing the Health Secretary appointed by him of not reaching the hospital to deal with a case of medical negligence citing unavailability of car. A peeved Kejriwal reacted on Twitter following media reports claiming Ambu-bags (manual hand-held devices which support breathing) being used to resuscitate patients due to an "acute shortage" of ventilators at hospitals. "Satinder, this is unacceptable (sic)," he tweeted. Later, Jain wrote on twitter that, "There is a death in LNH due to negligence.I requested Sec health to reach Hospital with me. He refused to come saying unavailability of car". According to sources in the Delhi governments Health Department, Jain had received an information about a patient, having died yesterday in Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narayan Hospital as he was allegedly unable to get ventilator support, and was going to the hospital to check the ground reality. He had also called the Health Secretary to come with him but the secretary refused saying his car was not available, they said. Jain blamed the LG saying that he has appointed the "most incompetent" IAS officer as the health secretary. "Shameful. LG has appointed the most incompetent, useless n insensitive IAS officer as health secy," Jain tweeted.
