Each member of this gang would be dressed in police uniforms and would travel in two different cars, an Ertiga and an Elantra.Once they would choose a vehicle as their target, they would chase and intercept it.

They would then be thrown outside at an isolated stretch of road.In their latest robbery on Saturday, they had intercepted a Honda City car in which three jewellers were travelling near Star City Mall in Mayur Vihar. After robbing their car and the silver jewellery items they were carrying, they threw the  jewellers on the roadside.Police said they had deployed their sources to help identify the robbers.
