His counsel said he would move the Supreme Court soon. Lodged in the Aluva sub jail, Dileep will be produced before the local court to extend his judicial custody.The 31-year-old actor was abducted by a gang of criminals and sexually assaulted in a moving car over a period of three hours on February 17.
