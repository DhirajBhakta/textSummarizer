Fast-food giant McDonald's will soon be adding masala dosa burgers with molaga podi sauce and anda bhurji as part of its famous breakfast menu, which until now was largely limited to vegetarian and egg cheese McMuffin, waffles, and hash brown.To be launched in Mumbai shortly, the world's largest fast-food company said the desi breakfast menu is aimed at increasing footfall by making the fare healthier.

Priced between Rs 30 and Rs 135, McDonald's will also serve breakfast through McDelivery and takeaway kiosks.
