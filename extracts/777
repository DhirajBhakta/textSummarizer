 B'luru jail superintendent transferred over Sasikala report.
R Anita, who was appointed as in-charge chief superintendent of the Central Prison, Bangalore, has now been transferred within less than a week after she assumed charge.Superintendent Anita was appointed on Monday in place of Krishna Kumar, who was transferred out in the wake of alleged large scale irregularities in the Bengaluru jail. She has been transferred to Dharwad and the Dharwad SP P Ramesh has been transferred to the Bangalore Central Jail.According to sources, Anita was transferred as her name also featured in D Roopa's report on VVIP perks given to Sasikala in the Bangalore Central Jail. In Roopa's report, it was mentioned that Anita had refused to give CCTV footage from the jail stating that the then chief superintendent Krishna Kumar had asked her not to.Later Anita had provided an edited copy to D Roopa.Anita was present when it was alleged that 32 convicts were beaten up inhumanly and shifted to various other prisons at Mysore, Ballari, Belagavi and Davanagere overnight.Allegedly, the prisoners were meted out this "inhuman" treatment because of their bid to stage a dharna inside the jail premises as they were not allowed to speak to (then) DIG (Prisons) D Roopa, who had visited the jail.Taking cognisance of a complaint about the alleged torture and transfer, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has issued notices to two top Karnataka prison officials.The issue of alleged preferential treatment to Sasikala, serving a four-year term in a disproportionate assets case, came to the fore after Roopa submitted a report to her superior, DGP (Prisons) H N Sathyanarayana Rao.Both DIG Roopa and DGP Rao were transferred after they sparred over the report in public.Also read:Bengaluru jail atrocities: Human rights commission slaps notices on Karnataka prison officials As DIG Roopa exposes jail perks to Sasikala, everything you need to know about VVIP prisoners How did she meet 82 people against 8 allowed RTI filed over Sasikala meeting visitors in Bengaluru prison
