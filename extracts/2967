India my country, won't leave: Man cleared of Mumbai blasts.
Abdul Qayyum Sheikh, who was acquitted of all the charges by the special TADA court in connection with the 1993 Mumbai serial blasts case, today said that he will stay in India and that it is his homeland.  Qayyum walked free after Judge G A Sanap of special TADA court said that the prosecution has been unable to prove any of the charges against him.  Qayyum's brother Kadeer paid several visits to the lawyers office to ascertain the cause behind the delay in acquital.The jail authorities said that the delay was due to a pending case in Hyderabad against him."All pending cases against each of the accused has to be checked and only then can the person be let out of the jail," said the officer. Kadeer, though claimed that it was a false case registered against Qayyum in Hyderabad since the authorities there wanted to keep him inside when he got acquitted in an old case. Kadeer, however, was apprehensive as he feared his brother being imprisoned in another case even before his release."There are many innocent people like me inside the jail. They should be released," said Qayyum after he was released.
