We take user privacy very seriously: Airtel after Jio breach.
New Delhi, Jul 10 (PTI) Telecom operator Bharti Airtel today termed data breach as a "real threat" to businesses and said that the company takes its responsbility on data security and customer privacy "very seriously". The comments come in the wake of reports yesterday that claimed that customer data, including mobile numbers and other details of Reliance Jio users, were allegedly leaked on an independent website named magicapk. But newcomer Jio has said the claims of the website are "unverified" and "unsubstantiated" and that it is investigating the matter. Jio has also said that its subscriber data is safe and maintained with the highest security. Asked if the recent eposide would prompt Airtel to strengthen its data security and systems, its MD and CEO (India and South Asia) Gopal Vittal said that data breach was a "real threat" globally, not only for telecom companies but for banks and credit card firms too. "This is a real threat that we face. We do our bit...we try and do what we can to protect and make sure that our systems are secure...the thing that we value most is customer privacy, we really take that very seriously," Vittal said. Last evening, Reliance Jio said it is investigating claims of the alleged data breach.
