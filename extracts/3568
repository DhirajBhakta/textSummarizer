Salman has an aura, love around him; he's incredible: Kaif.
Salman Khan and Katrina Kaif are reuniting on silver screen after a gap of five years. They were last seen in the 2012 film Ek Tha Tiger and now the makers are back with its sequel. And their on-screen reunion has got almost everybody talking. Katrina, who has worked with Salman in a handful of films, is glad to work with Salman again. During her session at Mind Rocks Guwahati 2017, the 33-year-old actor said that Tiger Zinda Hai is a very special film for her. "It's a really special set to be on because firstly, Salman is there. Salman and I acted together in Ek Tha Tiger, which is honestly one of my favourite films," she said at Mind Rocks Guwahati 2017. If this wasn't enough, Katrina is happy that she is reuniting with her Mere Brother Ki Dulhan director Ali Abbas Zafar for Ek Tha Tiger sequel. "Ali Abbas Zafar and I did a film together, Mere Brother Ki Dulhan. It was his first film as a director. Now for him to be putting together Tiger Zinda Hai as a sequel, it is a special set for me to be on. Ali is one of my best friends, Salman is somebody I have known for so long and he is such an amazing person to be around," she added.
