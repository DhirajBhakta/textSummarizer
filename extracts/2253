 Baby girl delivered by two Delhi policemen in PCR van.
Delhi cops acting as midwives? As crazy as that sounds, the cops ? yes, even male cops ? are trained to help deliver babies in emergency situations, and that training comes in handy every now and then. One recent occasion was when a woman went into labour at Old Delhi Railway Station at 4.15am; her panicked husband called the police control room. To cut a long story short, a PCR van (mobile patrol) arrived, and the woman delivered her baby in the van.?We rushed to the spot on receiving the call. What we saw was a woman, accompanied by her husband, suffering from labour pain. While taking her to the hospital, her water broke and we had to get the baby delivered in the van itself, near Netaji Subhash Marg,? says Inspector Rajendra Sehrawat, who was present during the incident. This is the seventh case of childbirth in the multipurpose vehicle this year. ?This is not new for us. We have trained our staff in such a way that they can handle childbirth,? says Monika Bhardwaj, DCP, Police Control Room. ?We?ve briefed our staff not to disturb the cord, giving the mother her privacy and taking the mother and baby to the nearest hospital. They have a fair idea of the process. We?re proud that they?re fulfilling their duties responsibly.? In most such cases, PCR vans come with policewomen, but this time, there were only two male police officers who handled the case. ?It?s easy when we have women officers with us. They look after the pregnant women very efficiently. But this time, the woman?s husband and our inspectors had to take charge. During trainings, we?re asked to not move the baby from his/her position, but convincing parents at that time is difficult. This father agreed and didn?t touch the baby girl,? says Sehrawat. The baby and mother were then taken to the LNJP hospital, Daryaganj, and were declared in good health. Follow @htshowbiz for more
