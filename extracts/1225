I sacked Sasikala before she expelled me: Madhusudhanan.
The AIADMK feud just refuses to end and now there's a new twist to the drama. Party presidium chairman E Madhusudanan, who was earlier in the day expelled by VK Sasikala, hit back at the general secretary in the evening. Madhusudanan, claimed that he had sacked Sasikala before she expelled him from the AIADMK. Madhusudanan, who is considered No 2 in AIADMK, switched sides on Thursday to join the rebel O Panneerselvam camp.Madhusudanan also wrote to the Election Commission not to recognise Sasikala as AIADMK general secretary.SASIKALA SACKS MADHUSUDANANEarlier, sending a strong message to her detractors, Sasikala sacked Madhusudanan from the primary membership of the party, a day after he switched over to the rebel camp led by caretaker Chief Minister O Panneerselvam, and appointed former minister K A Sengottaiyan in his place.Sasikala urged the party workers not to have any truck with Madhusudanan and said they should extend their cooperation to Sengottaiyan. Sasikala had removed Panneerselvam from the treasurer post immediately after his revolt, but he has maintained that being a temporary general secretary, she does not have the powers to appoint or remove party functionaries. Insisting that he continues to be the treasurer, Panneerselvam has written to banks not to allow anybody else to operate the party accounts without his consent.Sasikala had appointed another senior leader Dindigul C Srinivasan as the treasurer.
