"I was told by my distributor that Pakistan has a policy does not permit the import of films which deal with the issue of partition. On learning this I requested the key officer of the censor board of Pakistan to at least view the film and then take a decision. I was assured that they would look into the matter. Sadly, I have not heard from them after that," he said.Bhatt also added, "Later my distributor informed me that his office has been intimated that Begum Jaan should not be imported by him into Pakistan."Co-starring Naseeruddin Shah, Chunky Pandey, Ila Arun, Gauahar Khan in key roles, Begum Jaan, the Hindi remake of the critically acclaimed Bengali film Rajkahini (2015) is all set to hit theatres on April 14.
