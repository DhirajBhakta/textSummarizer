Obamas to board Air Force One for final time for vacation.
Following tradition, outgoing US President Barack Obama and his family will board the Air Force One for the final time as they fly to Palm Springs in California for a vacation after US President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration on January 20. "The first family is looking forward to flying to Palm Springs, California on Friday. The President vowed to take his family to a destination that is warmer than Washington DC on Friday and Palm Springs fits the bill," White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters on Tuesday. "This is a community that the president has visited on a number of occasions as President of the United States. He and his family have enjoyed the time they've spent there in the past," he said. The Obamas are looking forward to traveling there on Friday and will return to Washington DC after concluding their vacation, Earnest said, adding he did not have details about the how long the vacation will be. "I did not say how long they're gonna stay. They will arrive on Friday afternoon in Palm Springs, but I don't anticipate having any updates on their travel schedule beyond that," he said.
