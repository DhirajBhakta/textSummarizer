Install alarms in hostels to check ragging: UGC to varsities.
The University Grants Commission (UGC) has asked the universities across the country to install alarm bells in hostels to identify troublemakers  as part of the anti-ragging measures. The commission issued a circular on Wednesday, asking all the higher educational institutes to take steps to prevent ragging and warned them of punitive action if they failed to take action against those found guilty. Any violation of these regulations will be viewed seriously. If an institution fails to take adequate steps to prevent ragging or does not act in accordance with these regulations or fails to punish perpetrators suitably, it will attract punitive action by the UGC, reads the circular issued by Jaspal S Sandhu, secretary, UGC.So far, as many as 288 ragging-related complaints have been received by the anti-ragging call centre. Last year, the number stood at 515 and in 2015 it was 423. Most of the complaints have been received from Uttar Pradesh, followed by Madhya Pradesh. Universities have been asked to step up anti-ragging mechanisms by constituting an anti-ragging committee, anti-ragging squad, setting up anti-ragging cell and installing CCTVs. Some of the measures also include identification of troublemakers and surprise checks in hostels, student accommodations, canteens, recreational rooms, toilets and bus stops. Students in distress can call the national anti-ragging helpline 1800-180-5522 round-the-clock. The commission has also made four short films and a documentary film to counsel students on ill-effects of ragging.
