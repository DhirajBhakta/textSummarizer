						?Of course the GST has affected us. But it has affected not only the Bengali film industry but the entire film industry of the nation. So I think we (all regional film industries) have to find a way out collectively. We have to stand united against this (GST),? Chatterjee said on the sidelines of the 89th AGM of Indian Chamber of Commerce.?We in the Bengali film industry cannot do anything alone against GST overnight. There has been a national movement against it and we will also be a part of it. I do not think going alone for any movement against GST will yield any result. Let?s see,? Prosenjit said.The actor said that initially the Bengali film industry was mulling the option of shutting down cinema theatres in the state to protest against the roll out of the GST.Actors Prosenjit Chatterjee and Parno Mittra during a programme organised by Kolkata Police against child labour in Kolkata, on June 11.

						?We had decided to shut down the cinema halls but the idea was shelved because two movies, acted and produced by two of our Bengali heroes, (Dev?s Champ and Jeet?s Boss 2) are currently being shown in the theatres,? he said.Prosenjit while saying he was personally was for the shut down, sounded sceptical whether it would have any positive yield for the Bengali film industry in its fight against GST.?I do not know ... I do not think that there would be any result by closing down the cinema halls. In the past we had so many movements without shutting down. I have witnessed so many turbulences in my career of 34-35 years,? he said.Actors Prosenjit Chatterjee and Parno Mittra during a programme.

But we are thankful to our state government because of the rebate it is offering for our films. Around seven per cent rebate is quite high,?
