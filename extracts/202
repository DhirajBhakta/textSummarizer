Political party files 100 cr defamation case against Haasan.
Kamal Haasan and Bigg Boss Tamil have been plagued with problems from the start.Puthiya Tamizhagam, a Dalit party, has served a legal notice to a private TV channel and film actor Kamal Haasan for allegedly hurting the sentiments of those living in slums and huts due to comments made by an actor on the reality show Bigg Boss.In the notice served through the lawyers, the party has sought Rs 100 crore as damages if the actor and TV channel failed to tender an unconditional apology within seven days of receipt of the notice, Puthiya Tamizhagam founder-president Dr K Krishnasamy told reporters.Krishnasamy said he had already demanded that Haasan and the channel (Star Vijay TV) tender the apology a fortnight ago for the remarks made by Gayatri Raghuram, while referring to another actor that hers was cheri (a reference to those living in slums and huts) behaviour and notice was issued for their failure do so.I have already appealed to actor Gayathri Raguram, a Bigg Boss Tamil participant, to apologise for abusing another participant by saying that she was behaving like slum people. The term, which has hurt members of a particular community, should have been edited out by the channel, Krishnasamy told media persons at Kuniyamuthur here on Sunday. Though two weeks have passed, neither Gayathri Raguram nor show-host Kamal Haasan nor the TV channel have as yet apologised for using the term, he was quoted in the New Indian Express as saying.The remarks by Gayatri had hurt the sentiments of those living in slums and huts as it showed them in poor light, he said. If they failed to apologise within seven days of the receipt of the notice, he would approach high court seeking Rs 100 crore as damages, Krishnsasmy said.Besides Haasan, notices were issued to Gayatri Raghuram, Deepk Dhar, CEO and managing director, Endemol Shine India, Mumbai, and Ajay Vidya Sagar, general manager, Star Vijay TV, Chennai, he said.
