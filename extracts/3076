Akshay was 1st choice for Sohail's role in Tubelight: Report.
Kabir Khan's Tubelight has already grabbed eyeballs for the on-screen camaraderie between Salman Khan and Sohail Khan, who play brothers in the film too. But not many know that Sohail wasn't the first choice to play Bharat in Tubelight. In fact, Kabir wanted Akshay Kumar to play Salman's on-screen brother in the film. In an interview to DNA, Kabir revealed that while writing the script of the film, he was keen to cast an A-lister for Bharat's role. "Instead of a real brother, I thought we should get another actor and create the chemistry on screen," he told the daily. The director, who has collaborated with Salman for the third time, said that he had a few actors in his mind during the scripting stage, and Khiladi Kumar was one of them. "That was while we were developing the script, and before we could decide, I was convinced by Sohail. Maybe, with another actor, I would have had to spend time and create the chemistry that Salman and Sohail share," he added. However, it was Salman who was keen to get Sohail on board as he was convinced that their real-life bromance will translate effectively on screen. "They wanted someone bigger so that we could crack the number game and earn more at the box office. But I wanted to be really comfortable, and honestly, with Sohail, I didn't need to act too much. The emotions came automatically. So when you see the tears in the film, sometimes, they are my own emotions as a brother," said Salman. Kabir, who has worked with Sohail for the first time, is happy with the actor's hardwork in the film. "We put Sohail through a lot of hard work, like making him sprint across the mountains of Ladakh - anybody else in his place would have said, 'I'm out of this place', but Sohail kept going even with his oxygen pump in hand. Sohail's is a dignified character in the film. People will love him, I am sure," he added.  Tubelight is set to hit the screens this Eid.
