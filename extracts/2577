Abu Salem can't be kept in jail beyond 25 yrs, argues lawyer.
The lawyer of 1993 Mumbai serial blast convict Abu Salem on Monday began his arguments and sought lesser sentence to the extradited gangster before the special Tada court. Salem?s lawyer Sudeep Passbola told the court that some of the convicts, sentenced in the first set of trial, were awarded eight years imprisonment for the offence committed which was similar to what Salem was tried for. The lawyer said Salem has been in jail for the last 15 years, contending his detention period should be counted since the time he was detained in Portugal in 2002.
