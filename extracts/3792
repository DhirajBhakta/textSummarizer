Shahid wanted to be called 'superstar' by a magazine: Report.
Is Shahid Kapoor a star or a superstar The answer to that depends on whether you are a 'Shanatic' or not. Well, Shahid himself thought he was a superstar but unfortunately, the editor of a popular film magazine had to disagree.According to Rajeev Masand's latest column in Open Magazine, it all began when Shahid Kapoor did a photoshoot for the cover of a 'popular film glossy' a few days before the release of his film Rangoon. The issue was supposed to hit the stands a couple of weeks after the film's release.When the magazine's team sent Shahid a scan of the feature story, before the issue was sent to the press for printing, Shahid apparently 'balked', according to the magazine's editor. Shahid, reportedly, did not like being called a 'star' in the story's headline and demanded that 'star' should be changed to 'superstar'. Shahid said that if the magazine team did not want to make the change, he wanted the entire story 'pulled'.Consequently, the magazine team made the required change and the edition was sent to the press for printing.But Rangoon finally released and flopped big time. The magazine's editor reportedly 'felt silly for indulging the actor's whims' and immediately ensured that the issue was called back in time so that the headline could be changed again. So, the new headline focused on Shahid Kapoor recently becoming a father.
