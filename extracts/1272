Panneerselvam acting at DMK's behest: Sasikala.
AIADMK general secretary Sasikala Natarajan today said that DMK was behind interim chief minister O Panneerselvam's revolt against her. She had called for an emergency meeting at the Poes Garden late on Tuesday night after a dramatic turn in Tamil Nadu's politics wherein the incumbent Tamil Nadu CM Panneerselvam dropped a bombshell, saying he was forced to resign and propose party general secretary Sasikala's name to the top elected post in the state.Taking a major stand, Sasikala removed O Panneerselvam from the post of AIADMK's treasurer and came out of Poes Garden after a 3-hour long meeting, waving at the large number of supporters. Sasikala said all the party legislators were united as a single family. She said that DMK was behind Panneerselvam's action citing the bonhomie between him and DMK's working president MK Stalin in the Assembly.
