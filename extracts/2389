Perhaps Federer didn?t look as effortless today as in the previous rounds here, but his numbers for 2017 are staggering. Since he took six months out last year for knee surgery, he?s won 30 out of 32 matches, claiming four titles including the Australian Open, and he?ll go into Sunday?s final as the favourite to beat Marin Cilic for another grand slam crown - but Cilic did beat Federer at the 2014 US Open en route to his only major title. Thanks for reading and do join us for the women?s final tomorrow when another 30-something will be looking to create their own piece of Wimbledon history. Here?s Kevin Mitchell?s preview in case you missed it. Bye!Updated

Another silky win for Roger Federer - almost 36, 7x champ, lone remaining proxy of the Big 4 - into the final again #Wimbledon

A standing ovation for Federer, as the Wimbledon king holds court. The Royal Box join the applause, including Ken Rosewall. Federer?s now the oldest finalist here since Rosewall in 1974. As well as a record 11th Wimbledon final, it could be a record eighth title here and a record 19th grand slam crown. Roger does love a record.Federer speaks:I fell very privileged to be in another final. I?ve had the pleasure to play on Centre Court so many times, I almost can?t believe it?s true again. It was a long way back last year, it was difficult to stay calm and take time out. But I?m so happy I did it. Marin?s a great guy, I know him really well. I?m happy for him he?s in his first Wimbledon final. He crushed me at the US Open a few years ago, he played lights out. Ken Rosewall is a wonderful man so I?m happy he was here today.Updated

A huge roar from the crowd as Federer gets up from his chair and walks to the baseline. 15-0. 30-0. An even bigger roar at 40-0, three match points. Federer, perhaps a little overexcited, overcooks his backhand. 40-15. Game, set and match Federer when Berdych nets! Federer is through to his 11th Wimbledon final where he?ll face Marin Cilic!Updated

Third set: *Federer 7-6, 7-6, 5-4 Berdych (*denotes next server)Berdych appears to be doing that with ease. 15-0, 30-0, 40-0. But then it?s 40-30, with a wonderfully casual cross-court forehand-cum-squash shot from Federer. Berdych survives from there but his resistance could be futile. In 90 seconds, Federer will step up to serve for a place in the Wimbledon final.Updated

Third set: Federer 7-6, 7-6, 5-3 Berdych* (*denotes next server)How does Federer back up the break? With a love hold, of course. Berdych must hold his serve now if he?s to detain Federer for any longer.

6.41pm BST
18:41

Third set: *Federer 7-6, 7-6, 4-3 Berdych (*denotes next server)Now it?s Berdych who appears to be dwelling on his missed opportunities. He slides 0-30 down before steeling himself to 30-all. Federer?s forehand volley brings up break point, 30-40. Berdych?s first serve slaps the net, his second goes to Federer?s backhand, which flies down the line and Berdych makes the error. Federer breaks. Surely Berdych has reached the point of no return.

6.36pm BST
18:36

Third set: Federer 7-6, 7-6, 3-3 Berdych* (*denotes next server)Perhaps Federer can?t get that missed break point out of his mind. 15-30 on his serve, and he looks annoyed. Make that 15-40, two break points! Federer fends off the first and then aces Berdych down the T. Deuce. Another big serve, advantage Federer. Another one! Game Federer. That?s how to get yourself out of a 15-40 hole.

6.32pm BST
18:32

Third set: *Federer 7-6, 7-6, 2-3 Berdych (*denotes next server)A giggle from the Centre Court patrons as Federer is caught off guard and has to improvise, putting his racket in front of his face to defend himself. But I?m not sure it had the finesse of a shot from Sachin Tendulkar, who the cameras zoom in on in the crowd. Federer recovers to give himself a break point at 30-40. He nets and, unusually for him, chides himself in Swiss-German. Deuce. Berdych wins the next two points to hold.

Third set: Federer 7-6, 7-6, 2-2 Berdych* (*denotes next server)15-0, 30-0, 40-0, game Federer. No nuances in that game either. Perhaps they?re just stretching their legs before another tie-break. Updated

Third set: *Federer 7-6, 7-6, 1-2 Berdych (*denotes next server)Berdych holds comfortably. Federer is sniffling into his tissues at almost every changeover but the cold doesn?t seem to be hindering him today.

6.23pm BST

Third set: Federer 7-6, 7-6, 1-1 Berdych* (*denotes next server)An ?arrrrgh!? from Federer as he frames the ball, which then hits him. For all of his serene strokes, he does throw in some hilarious misses sometimes, because of his immense racket speed. Berdych holds to 15 before putting a little pressure on the Federer serve, 0-30. Federer snuffs out the danger with four straight points.Updated

Fancy some between-sets reading? Sure you do. Here?s Kevin Mitchell?s preview of the women?s final:

6.14pm BST
18:14

... Federer balloons a return but he?s still 5-2 ahead and he now has two points on his serve ... a gasp as Federer loses the point for 5-3 ... but a cheer and standing ovation as he brings up three set points at 6-3 ... Berdych dismisses the first with a brutal forehand but meekly nets on the second! Federer?s 101st match at Wimbledon looks to be going the way most of the other 100 did. He?s a set away from a place in Sunday?s final.

6.10pm BST
18:10

This is a must-win tie-break for Berdych surely. He hasn?t come from two sets down since 2005. The pair share the first two points on serve, 1-1 .. before Federer gobbles up an inviting second serve to grab the first mini-break, 2-1 Federer ... 3-1 Federer ... 4-1 Federer with a delightful forehand pass. That?s three forehand winners in a row ... make that four, well nearly four because Berdych gets a racket to the ball but he?s not getting that back into court, 5-1 Federer as they change ends ...

Second set: *Federer 7-6, 6-6 Berdych (*denotes next server)That Berdych does at a canter. 15-0, 30-0, 40-0, game, as Federer nets the return. It doesn?t look like Federer was even trying on that final shot; perhaps he?s saving his energy for the breaker.Updated

Second set: Federer 7-6, 6-5 Berdych* (*denotes next server)You have to give credit to Berdych. He?s been under so much pressure during this match on his serve but he?s still taking it to Federer, moving the 35-year-old around with aggression and coming to the net whenever he can. Federer holds and Berdych must survive one more service game in this set to force the tie-break.

6.01pm BST
18:01

Second set: *Federer 7-6, 5-5 Berdych (*denotes next server)Federer goes long on the first point. 15-0. But he shows his quick feet on the second point, adjusting his footwork after Berdych?s effort flies off the net to put away the winner. 15-all. A bad miss by Berdych, 15-30. Federer is possibly two points from a two sets to love lead. But Berdych isn?t entertaining thoughts of that. 30-all. 40-30. Game Berdych. If Federer and Berdych both hold serve again we?ll be into another tie-break.

5.58pm BST
17:58

Second set: Federer 7-6, 5-4 Berdych* (*denotes next server)15-all becomes 30-15 when Berdych biffs long, and that becomes 40-15 when Federer nonchalantly flicks a backhand winner down the line. Wife Mirka nods approvingly in the players? box. Federer comes through to 15, meaning Berdych must hold serve to stay in this second set.

Second set: *Federer 7-6, 4-4 Berdych (*denotes next server)A rarity for Berdych, a hold to love. Back to you, Roger ...

Second set: Federer 7-6, 4-3 Berdych* (*denotes next server)Federer?s forced to play two half volleys from the baseline on successive points. 0-30. Could this be Berdych?s moment? With Federer on the ropes, he comes out swinging, moving forward to the net. 30-15. 30-all. He allows himself a little fist pump at 40-30. Berdych sees Federer?s fist pump and raises it when the Czech gets to deuce. And advantage Berdych - break point - with a thunderous forehand! Federer waves his light sabre, with an out-of-this-world cross-court forehand winner. Deuce. Advantage Federer. Game Federer.

5.48pm BST
17:48

Second set: *Federer 7-6, 3-3 Berdych (*denotes next server)Berdych could do with an easy hold here. He already has the gait of a man who?s been put through the mill. And he can only stumble forward before digging his racket into the grass when Federer volleys. 30-15. But Berdych has a little spring in his step when he takes the next two points to hold.

Second set: Federer 7-6, 3-2 Berdych* (*denotes next server)That lengthy service game for Berdych is followed by another quick one for Federer, who holds to 15.

5.41pm BST
17:41

Second set: *Federer 7-6, 2-2 Berdych (*denotes next server)At 30-15, Federer runs round his backhand to let rip with an inside-out forehand return winner. 30-all. Another punishing return, 30-40, the first break point of this second set. This time Federer can?t get enough on the return, it lands short and down the middle, Berdych steps in to dispatch the winner. Deuce. Advantage Federer, when Berdych nets. Berdych?s serve comes to his rescue. Deuce. Advantage Berdych, with some commanding net play. Berdych looks to have taken the game with a drive volley but Federer somehow skips far to his right, waves his wand, and conjures up a forehand pass down the line! Wow. Deuce. Advantage Berdych. Game Berdych, but Federer is asking a lot of questions.

Second set: *Federer 7-6, 1-1 Berdych (*denotes next server)Federer looks like he may carve out the chance for an early break in the second set at 30-all. But he frames his backhand return which seems to fly as high as the nosebleed seats. The fans in the (still not so cheap) seats kindly throw the ball back. And Berdych holds to 30.

... Federer goes for the one-two punch - he has the open court to aim into but his forehand lands beyond the baseline! Back on serve, 4-3 Federer ... and then it?s Berdych?s turn to throw in a bad miss, 5-3 Federer ... 5-4 Federer, who?ll now have two points on his serve to take the first set ... 6-4 Federer, two set points ... and one will do! Federer takes the first set in 53 minutes! Credit to Berdych for showing such resolve to come back from 4-2 down but it still wasn?t enough.

5.16pm BST
17:16

First set: *Federer 5-6 Berdych (*denotes next server)At 15-all, Berdych cracks a forehand deep to Federer?s forehand wing, Federer just about gets it back, Berdych comes into the net, unwinds and ... nets! 15-30, could that prove to be a costly error? Federer challenges on the next point but Hawk-Eye doesn?t rule in his favour. 30-all. He?s all out of challenges already. For a man as talented as Federer, his judgment when it comes to making appeals is awful. But now it?s 30-40, break point. I was going to say chalk flies up on the break point as Berdych sends an ace down the middle. But it?s not chalk these days, it?s titanium pigment. Not quite so snappy, is it? I can?t quite see John McEnroe saying: ?You can?t be serious! Titanium pigment flew up!? Deuce. Advantage Federer, a second break point. Deuce. And from there Berdych shows nerve to hold.

First set: Federer 4-4 Berdych* (*denotes next server)Of course Federer never sweats. That would somehow seem too human for a superhuman like him. But look here, he?s under a bit of pressure on serve for the first time at 30-all. And there?s a double fault! 30-40, break point. Berdych attempts the cross-court forehand pass but it barely makes the top half of the net. Deuce. But he makes amends on the next point with a winner from an almost identical spot. Advantage Berdych, a second break point. Deuce. Advantage Berdych, a third break point. And there?s another double fault as Federer?s second serve misses by a whisker! The Centre Court gasps. It?s not often you see Federer gifting the break point to his opponent like that.Updated

First set: *Federer 4-3 Berdych (*denotes next server)But from the sublime to the ridiculous from Federer - that?s one for the bloopers tape. 15-0 Berdych. 15-all. 30-15 as Berdych batters down his first ace. Berdych charges to the net on the next point, he doesn?t really give Federer much to aim into and Federer fires into the tramlines. 40-15. 40-30. Federer mishits the return but he?s lucky as it lands on the baseline and he then peels off a beautiful backhand winner. Deuce. But Berdych, sweat dripping from him already - his service games have averaged nearly five minutes compared to one minute for Federer - holds from there.@KatyMurrells all the Fed superlatives are used up but as my late dad used to say 'mother of sweet lanterin Jaysus this lad is some player'Updated

First set: *Federer 3-2 Berdych (*denotes next server)Federer turns defence into attack in the blink of an eye, firing a forehand down the line before Berdych prods long.15-all. Federer?s putting in the hard yards on the next point too, he sprints to his left and attempts the pass but it doesn?t come off. 30-15. 40-15. 40-30. Some heavy cross-court hitting on the next point from a tight angle and it?s deuce. Federer slices and dices Berdych into submission on the next point, before finally ripping a forehand winner. Advantage Federer, break point. His second of the match. Federer looks to have set the point up with a deep return but Berdych recovers. Deuce. Advantage Berdych. Deuce. Advantage Federer, another break point. Federer wallops a forehand deep into the corner before backing it up with a ferocious drive volley. Stunning. Federer breaks.Updated

First set: Federer 1-1 Berdych* (*denotes next server)Federer does the business on serve much quicker, holding to 15 with the minimum of fuss. There are some sporting big guns watching on from the Royal Box, including Eddie Jones, Paula Radcliffe, Nico Rosberg, Sachin Tendulkar, Rod Laver and Ken Rosewall, who was 39 when he reached the last of his four finals here in 1974. Federer will become the oldest Wimbledon finalist since Rosewall if he wins today.Updated

First set: *Federer 0-1 Berdych (*denotes next server)Berdych is a big hitter so this is a similar match-up for Federer to his Raonic quarter-final. Berdych will have to be accurate with his serve and forehand today to avoid Federer manoeuvring him around. The Czech does that on the first point, quickly fizzing away a forehand winner. But he then lets Federer toy with him, and the seven-time champion pulls off the passing shot to get to deuce. And here?s an early break point. The pair battle it out from the back of the court and Federer blinks first. Deuce. Advantage Berdych. Game Berdych with an unreturned serve. It?s only the first game but that could be a big hold.

4.25pm BST
16:25

Thump, thwack, thump, thwack, thump, thwack, they?re warming up. As for their head-to-head, Berdych will need to summon all the strength he can from the memory of that 2010 Wimbledon win over Federer, who leads 18-6 and has won their past seven meetings, including at the Australian Open and in Miami this year. ?I thought the match we played [in Melbourne], I have probably never seen him playing better tennis,? Berdych has said. ?Then I played him in Miami, I almost beat him, had a match point. Now for the third one, hopefully the luck [will be] for me.?Berdych has gone under the radar this fortnight, until the drama of Djokovic?s retirement in the quarter-finals. The Czech?s best performance probably came in last 16 when he downed the dangerous Dominic Thiem in five sets.

The players will be on court soon because Marin Cilic has reached his first Wimbledon final at the 11th time of asking, coming from a set down to beat Sam Querrey 6-7, 6-4, 7-6, 7-5.

And then there was one. Well sure, there are actually three, but there?s only one member of the big four left, and he?s the one who?s going to win it, right? While Andy Murray limped, Novak Djokovic winced and Rafael Nadal was bundled out before his grass-court revival could gather any more pace, Roger Federer has spent this fortnight looking as serene as he did a decade ago when he was collecting all those Wimbledon titles for fun ? minus the silly suits, gold-trimmed man-bags and cardigans emblazoned with RF. Perhaps the 35-year-old has a greater sense of humility and of appreciating the moment now, and if he were to win an eighth Wimbledon crown five years after his last it may mean more than any of the others, apart from possibly the first in 2003.The numbers for Federer this year and this fortnight are remarkable. His win-loss record for 2017 is 29-2. He?s won four of the six tournaments he?s played, including the Australian Open, his 18th grand slam title. He warmed up for Wimbledon by lifting the title at Halle for a ninth time. He hasn?t dropped a set on his way to the semi-finals here and has only been broken three times. And all of this after he took six months out last year for knee surgery. Perhaps the ailing Murray and Djokovic should take note.Today?s opponent is the Czech world No15, Tomas Berdych, who was the Wimbledon runner-up in 2010, when he enjoyed his best run at a grand slam, beating Federer and Djokovic before losing to Nadal in the final. The 31-year-old also hit the headlines in this country in 2015 when he was on the receiving end of a sweary outburst from Andy Murray?s wife Kim during a match at the Australian Open. ?Flash fuck? appeared to be her choice words but ?sitting duck? may describe Berdych today if Federer hits his recent heights. However, perhaps men?s quarter-finals day taught us to expect the unexpected.Updated
