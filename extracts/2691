Shah Rukh has gifted Salman Khan a luxury car: Reports.
Bollywood's very own Karan-Arjun are busy bromancing, and giving their fans some major friendship goals. If Shah Rukh Khan agreed to do a cameo in Salman Khan-starrer Tubelight, the Bajrangi Bhaijaan actor has decided to return the favour by shaking a leg in one of the dance numbers for Aanand L Rai's next with SRK. While the two Khans have already begun shooting for the film, here's some scoop. If a report in BollywoodLife is to be believed, Shah Rukh has gifted a luxurious car to friend Salman as a thank you token for taking out time from his busy schedule to work in Aanand L Rai's next. A source was quoted as telling the website, "When Salman Khan came to shoot for the song, Shah Rukh surprised him by gifting him a brand new, luxurious car. The car is newly launched and no one owns this mean machine currently. Salman was shocked as he wasn't expecting this at all. But because he had managed his dates and agreed to shoot for the song on such a short notice, SRK wanted to gift him something to show his love and appreciation."After Tubelight, we cannot wait to see SRK and Salman share screen space again in Aanand L Rai's next.
