Nirbhaya wanted her rapists to be set on fire: Report.
After the Supreme Court on Friday upheld the death sentence awarded to Nirbhaya's rapists, a sub-divisional magistrate who listened to her last declaration said she wanted her tormentors to be set ablaze, the Times of India reported.SDM Usha Chaturvedi told TOI she was "happy and satisfied" the convicts would be sent to the gallows, and that Nirbhaya in December 2012 said "the rapists should not just be hanged but (also) set on fire," the report said.The nation's top court yesterday rejected a plea challenging the death penalty given to Mukesh Singh, Vinay Sharma, Akshay Thakur and Pawan Gupta by the Delhi High Court, and decided they would be hanged till death.The matter was heard by a bench headed by Justice Dipak Misra, and also comprised Justices R Banumathi and Ashok Bhushan.The Supreme Court noted that the brutality, cruelty and the perverse nature of the crime made it a 'rarest of rare' case.The convicts still have three options left - filing a review petition in response to the apex court's verdict (their lawyers have said they plan to do so), filing a curave petition if the review petition is dismissed, and finally, requesting the president of India to commute their death sentence in a mercy petition.
