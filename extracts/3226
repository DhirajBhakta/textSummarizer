Raabta is not a copy of Telugu film Magadheera: Producers.
Ever since the trailer of Raabta released, fans couldn't help but draw comparisons between Sushant Singh Rajput and Kriti Sanon-starrer and the 2009 Telugu film Magadheera. And now a day after the makers of Magadheera approached the Hyderabad court to seek injunction against the release of Raabta, its makers have come in defense of their film. Magadheera was a love story set in different time zones. And the makers of the Telugu film have alleged that Raabta has plagiarised the core of Magadheera. However, the producers of Raabta have denied the plagiarism allegation and said in an official statement, "We would like to, however, categorically reject even the remotest of suggestions that our film is a copy of Magadheera. We find it extremely unsavoury and disrespectful when people from the industry belittle someone's hard work by using words like "copied", "plagiarised" nonchalantly and jump to conclusions merely on the basis of a 2 minute and 14 second trailer, without verifying the facts or waiting for the film to release for the public to give its verdict." The statement further read, "'No one can claim copyright in ideas and plot' has been the very essence of copyright law in India for decades." The makers of Raabta added that its is an original film that presents their version of a timeless love story.Official Statement on behalf of the producers of #Raabta, Dinesh Vijan and Bhushan Kumar pic.twitter.com/ueU87TUIuv The Hyderabad court will hear the case on June 1 to decide the release of Raabta, which is slated to hit the screens on June 9.
