Sinha advocates 'pitamah' Advani's name for next president.
The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) may have formed a three-member team to pick a candidate to represent the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the upcoming presidential election but party leader Shatrughan Sinha believes there's no one better than LK Advani to represent the ruling alliance.In a series of tweets, Shatrughan Sinha called Advani 'pitamah' (father figure) said the veteran leader should have the first and last choice as presidential candidate. "Advaniji is far above others if election is done through a referendum or direct voting by the people, of the people & for the people. Advani ji should have been the 1st & last choice of the country for the President's post in present scenario," the actor-turned politician said."I sincerely hope, wish and pray that good sense prevails on one and all and the Pitamah of BJP is bestowed upon with the honour that he most richly deserves. Long live Advani ji, Long live BJP, Jai Hind!" he said. Sinha's proximity to Advani is nothing new and many believe that it was due this closeness the current party leadership has sidelined the Patna Sahib MP. Shatrughan Sinha has attacked his own party over various issues via cryptic tweets but the BJP has avoided taking any action against him so far. Recently, he came out in support of RJD chief Lalu Prasad and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, and slammed those who indulge in negative politics and mudslinging on political opponents. "Enough of negative politics and mudslinging by opponents on our political leaders, be it Kejriwal, Laloo Yadav or Sushil Modi," Shatrughan Sinha tweeted."Our BJP surely believes in honesty and transparency, which seldom go together, but must go together. An allegation is ONLY THAT unless proved," he said.ALSO READ:In series of tweets, BJP MP Shatrughan Sinha praises Arvind Kejriwal, calls for end to negative politics, mudslinging
