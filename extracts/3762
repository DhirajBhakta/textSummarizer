Baahubali 2 director defends Katappa actor over Cauvery row.
India's highly anticipated Baahubali: The Conclusion is facing stiff protest from an activist Vatal Nagaraj, who demanded Sathyaraj to apologise for his insensitive remarks on Kannadigas during the Cauvery water issue.Speaking about the issue, SS Rajamouli, in an exclusive interview with India Today, said, "It is a sad thing and we were shocked to see that on social media." Sathyaraj as the salve warlord Katappa, is one of the most important characters in The Conclusion."I worked with Sathyaraj for almost five years and I could have never ever imagined he is a person who could try to hurt someone. Some videos were posted on the internet. When we started inquiring, we learned that whatever comments Mr Sathyaraj made it was nine years back. And after that, about 30 films of his were released in Karnataka. Baahubali 1 released. No one had problems with that. And suddenly, raking up the issue at this point in time is not right," he said.Rana Daggubati, who plays the mighty Bhallala Deva, also reacted to the issue. He said, "That's something he (Sathyaraj) said 10 years ago. Baahubali part 1 released in Karnataka and everybody loved it. It was huge in Karnataka. I mean, they're just trying to make news again."Made on a lavish budget of Rs 250 crore, Baahubali is touted to have earned more than Rs 500 crore even before its release through its satellite and distribution rights.Directed by SS Rajamouli, Baahubali 2 takes the story forward from where Baahubali: The Beginning ended. Prabhas, Rana Daggubati, Anushka Shetty, Tamannaah, Sathyaraj and Ramya Krishnan star in pivotal roles in this instalment of Baahubali too. The film is slated to release on April 28 this year.ALSO READ: SS Rajamouli discussed Mahabharata with Aamir before Baahubali 2
