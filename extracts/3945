I have made a career out of flop films: Manoj Bajpayee .
Mumbai, Apr 4 (PTI) Actor Manoj Bajpayee says the credit for his success in the film industry goes to his "so called" flop movies. The actor says he has faced a lot a rejection and the failures have made him what he is. "Success doesnt teach you anything. Failures, rejections, they make you the man that you are. In my life, Ive mostly seen rejections and failures and flops. I am a living example of an actor making a career out of flops," Bajpayee told PTI. "You can count my hit films on your fingertips. But if you count the number of flops that I am proud of, they are several in numbers," he adds. The actor, best known for featuring in critically acclaimed films like "Satya", "Shool" and "Gangs of Wasseypur", says movies which do not work at the box office, are often the ones which have longer shelf life. "I am here because of those so called flop films as they were appreciated the most. They take me all around the world. Aligarh and Budhia Singh are still running in some pockets of the world."
