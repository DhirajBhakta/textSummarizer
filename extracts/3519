AAP MLA Amanatullah Khan resigned from the Political Affairs Committee (PAC) after senior leader Kumar Vishwas refused to attend the meeting on Monday.Khan while coming out of the PAC meeting said, "I stand by what I said about Vishwas. He is working at the behest of the BJP and RSS." Staying rigid on his stand, Khan added, "Vishwas ate cake with Ajit Doval and Bassi when AAP MLAs were arrested."After Khan's resignation, Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia today asked all party MLAs and workers not to give public statements."No MLAs, workers should give public statements. We need to have trust in the party. If there is any issue, talk to Arvind Kejriwal," he said, adding that such acts result in loss to the party and Delhi."We have three years during which we have to work on WiFi, schools, health, etc. These small statements result adversely affect the morale of our party workers." Earlier, Delhi Chief Minister and Aam Aadmi Party convener Arvind Kejriwal held a meeting and discussed the infighting in the party with senior party leaders Manish Sisodia, Sanjay Singh, Dilip Pandey and Ashutosh.Kejriwal is learnt to be unhappy with the way Amanatullah Khan made the allegations after Kumar Vishwas called for a deeper introspection within the party in the aftermath of the electoral drubbing that the AAP received in Punjab, Goa and Delhi.Amanatullah had also alleged that Kumar Vishwas is trying to take control of the AAP replacing Arvind Kejriwal as the party convener.Yesterday, Arvind Kejriwal had come in the defence of Kumar Vishwas calling him as a younger brother. Kejriwal had tweeted saying, "Kumar is my younger brother. Some people are trying to drive a wedge between us. They are enemies of the party. They should refrain. No one can separate us."
