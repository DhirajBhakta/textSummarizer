Kamal Haasan criticised for naming actress in abduction case.
Controversies are nothing new to Kamal Haasan. Recently, in a press conference, Kamal Haasan, while supporting the Malayalam actress, named the survivor's name and tried to justify it. "Why is it the safety of women in the film industry alone A female's presence in the crowd is important to me and I will not let anything happen to her. It's our duty to see if you are safe. It is not just about actresses. We are not supporting her (mentions the name), because she is an actress," said Haasan.When a female reporter corrected Haasan and asked him to not name the victim, he said, "It doesn't matter if I have used the name. It is you (media). You put out her name when the incident happened. Do not hide the name as there is nothing wrong with it. If you want to call her Draupadi, call her that. Don't refer to her as 'a female'," he added.While Kamal was appreciated for his take on women's safety, he was severely criticised for naming the actress' name. Earlier, Malayalam actress Dileep and Aju Varghese received brickbats for the same. Kamal Haasan was addressing the media after a fringe Hindu group had demanded the arrest of the actor for hosting the Tamil version of Bigg Boss. According to reports, the security has been beefed up at Haasan's residence owing to the protests from the fringe group.The popular Malayalam actress, who has worked in Tamil and Telugu films, was abducted and allegedly molested by a gang of six earlier this February.  ALSO READ: Dileep's bail plea to be heard todayALSO READ: Kerala actress  says she had personal problems with Dileep
