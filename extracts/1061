Her brother Borna, who is 15, had also registered in the games on his own.In 2017, a ban like this in Iran may come as an accepted norm but the story hasn't been the same always.Tables were turned after the Iranian Revolution of 1979 or called as the 1979 Islamic Revolution in Iran.This is how women in Iran dressed up like in 1970s.An old magazine photo of an Iranian woman in 1970s.Poles apart but another Iranian woman in a magazine before the Islamic Revolution.Magazine model without hijab in 1970s.Another shot from the bygone era of Iran.And this is 2017.  Dorsa is a member of the Iranian Women's National Chess Team. She is also the sixth world champion in under-18 games. Well, that never mattered compared to donning a particular attire. She got banned for not covering her hair at the Tradewise Gibraltar Chess Festival.According to the head of Iran's Chess Federation Mehrdad Pahlevanzadeh, they will "seriously deal" with Dorsa for not observing the veil, and brother Borna who played with an Israeli player.
