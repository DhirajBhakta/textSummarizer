If Yogi is UP CM, Dawood can be CBI Director, tweets Shirish.
Shirish Kunder is famous for going out on a limb and attracting trolls on Twitter. More or less, that is. This time around, the filmmaker invited the wrath of a certain section of Twitter for his comments on Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath.When Yogi Adityanath was announced as the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, writer Chetan Bhagat tweeted, "#YogiAdityanath as UP CM. Because when you make the naughtiest guy in class the class monitor, he behaves the best."Shirish Kunder's tweets on the UP Chief Minister were probably in response to Bhagat's 'logic'.In the now-deleted tweets, Kunder wrote, "Hoping a goon will stop rioting once he's allowed to rule is like expecting a rapist to stop raping once he's allowed to rape."And the next tweet read, "Going by the logic of making a goon as CM so that he behaves, Dawood can be CBI director. And Mallya - RBI Governor."Even though Yogi Adityanath's appointment as the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh has raised several eyebrows, Shirish Kunder's tweets were not spared. The Joker director was burnt on the micro-blogging platform for his anti-Yogi tweets. And for the uninitiated, Kunder has more often than not been roasted on Twitter for his views on politics.
