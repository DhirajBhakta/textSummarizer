I feel awkward when I don't win an award: Sushant.
Sushant Singh Rajput is not very happy these days. He played Mahendra Singh Dhoni, the former limited overs captain of the Indian cricket team, in the latter's biopic last year.While Sushant cast his spell on the box office with MS Dhoni The Untold Story, the people judging the awards' shows don't seem to be too impressed with him. Sushant Singh Rajput has missed out on most of the Best Actor awards.When DNA asked Sushant what he had to say about seeing other actors picking up the Best Actor trophy at the award shows, Sushant said, "I won't lie. If I'm there to witness the awards, I do feel slightly awkward when I don't win. A bit of acknowledgment from you folks could be a nice feeling."MOVIE REVIEW: MS DHONI THE UNTOLD STORYALSO WATCH: MS Dhoni The Untold Story Movie Review
