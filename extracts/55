Release of Shraddha Kapoor's 'Haseena Parkar' postponed.
Shraddha Kapoor?s ambitious project Haseena Parker has been postponed again and the reason being cited is upcoming big releases in August. The film, based on the life of Dawood Ibrahim?s sister, was initially scheduled to release on July 21. It was then slated to hit the theatres on August 18. Now, in order to avoid a box office clash with Shah Rukh Khan and Akshay Kumar?s film, the makers have decided to push the release date for later. The new release date is yet to be announced.Shraddha Kapoor as young and old Haseena in the film.A Mid Day report quoted the film?s director Apoorva Lakhia: ?We collectively decided to postpone the film so that it can get enough screens and a worthy run at the box-office.?The movie features Dawood?s sister Haseena Parkar?s journey from age 17 to 40 and her transformation from a young girl into Aapa. Shraddha?s brother Siddhanth Kapoor plays the role of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim, accused of the 1993 Mumbai blasts in which hundreds of people lost their lives.?The decision to postpone the film was taken last week. Anil Thadani (the film?s distributor), the producers and director Apoorva Lakhia realised that August was cluttered with too many releases. They realised that Haseena will have to compete with two biggies that are releasing in the weeks before ? Shah Rukh Khan?s Jab Harry Met Sejal (August 4) and Akshay Kumar?s Toilet: Ek Prem Katha (August 11). What makes it worse is that besides Haseena Parkar, there are three releases lined up for August 18 ? Bareilly Ki Barfi, Newton and Partition 1947,? it quoted a source as saying.The Apoorva Lakhia directed film also stars Rajesh Tailang, Ankur Bhatia and Sunil Upadhyay. Follow @htshowbiz for more
