What a strange day. Andy Murray and Novak Djokovic have both hobbled out of the tournament and its the first time since 2005 that only one member of the Big Four has made it to the Wimbledon semis. That mans Roger Federer. Hes through to play Tomas Berdych on Friday. The other semi will be contested by Marin Cilic and Sam Querrey. Its Federers to lose, but its time to expect the unexpected. Thats all from me today. Thanks for reading and emailing. Bye.Novak Djokovic, in Serbian: "maybe i will miss half a year playing." Sounds like won't make US Open.Updated

Djokovic is the 10th player to retire. Weve had a very long, very tough year with a lot of matches. Bodies have taken a lot physically. As an athlete, one way or another you are going to experience this kind of thing. Injuries are part of sport.

Djokovic continues. The intensity and level of pain was increasing as the days went by. I was feeling it since the beginning of the tournament. I kept doing everything with my physiotherapist. It was only getting worse. Today was the worst day. Probably the fact I played yesterday, days adding up, it wasnt helping. Im not a specialist but Im going to speak with some and understand what needs to be done. I havent considered not starting. I always like to give it a shot and step on the court. Thats all I could do.

Djokovic says he will talk with specialists to see how he can solve the problem. He says he needs to rest.

Was it challenging to play back-to-back days Those kind of circumstances dont really help. At the end of the day its the kind of situation you have to accept. I spent two hours on the table. It wasnt to be. For an athlete there is no way out if you dont feel fit.

Novak Djokovic speaks. Its not the shoulder, its the elbow that keeps bothering me. For over a year and a half actually. Its unfortunate I have to finish Wimbledon in this way. I was able for 30 minutes to play with some pain that was bearable. All the treatments and medication couldnt help. The serves and forehands were where I could feel it the most and after that there was really no point.

6.26pm BST

Well, whod have thought that only one member of the Big Four would still be standing at the end of play on the second Wednesday That decision to skip the French Open by Federer doesnt look too bad now.

Third set tie-break: Federer* 7-4 Raonic (*denotes server): After a short rally, Raonic screws a backhand wide. What a tie-break from Federer, who leaps with joy after sealing his place in another Wimbledon semi-final. He has revenge for last year and his sights on an eighth title here!Updated

Tomas Berdych looks rather sheepish after, er, claiming his, er, third ever win over Novak Djokovic. The world No4 decided that the pain in his elbow was too much and hes out of the tournament. What a gimme for Berdych. Hes through to the semis. This is turning into a rather drab affair on the mens side, isnt itUpdated

Tomas Berdych has broken in the second game of the second set to lead 7-6, 2-0! Deep, penetrative hitting draws the error from Djokovic. Back on Centre Court, Raonic comes through deuce to hold for 5-4 in the third. Can he force a fourth set

After a medical timeout, Novak Djokovic is ready for the second set on Court 1. Hed won 14 sets in a row against Tomas Berdych. Not a 15th, though. I wonder if hell suffer the kind of collapse we saw against Dominic Thiem in Paris

6.00pm BST

Back on Centre Court, Milos Raonic has held and lost three break points in the eighth game of the third set. Federer saved them all and he ends up holding for 4-4 with a dreamy touch at the net.

5.50pm BST
17:50

Looking to force a first-set tie-break, Tomas Berdych, races into a 40-0 lead. You feel hes playing at his maximum, whereas Novak Djokovic can still go up a level or two. So it proves when Djokovic charges to deuce. Eventually Berdych holds.

5.37pm BST
17:37

After taking a rather lengthy toilet break after the second set, Milos Raonic is feeling more peppy and he earns his first break point in the second game of the third set. The unflappable Federer saves it with accurate serving and holds with an ace.

5.30pm BST
17:30

Theres no sign of a break on Court 1. Its still on serve after seven games and Djokovic leads 4-3.

5.27pm BST
17:27

Any ideas on whats happened to Milos forehand says Michael Devine. Its a completely different stroke in this matchhigh, looping topspins that sit up invitingly and land short, as opposed to his usual flat stroke. If this is Mark Knowles work, Id say his tenure is going to be short.Raonic has had a few injury problems this year, so perhaps hes not at full pelt. Still, hes dropping his forehands very short today and thats asking for it against Federer, whos giving it the treatment.

5.25pm BST
17:25

Federer earns three set points with an ace. This is preposterous. He pings a forehand into the left corner and Raonic nets a backhand. The Canadians surely not winning this one.

Heres a report on Marin Cilics win by Simon Cambers.

5.15pm BST

Milos Raonic coolly saves two break points, but theres no denying Roger Federer on the third. Another singing crosscourt backhand does the job as Raonic stretches and plants a volley wide for Federer to break again and lead 6-4, 4-1. I wonder if hes after a spot of revenge after last year.Updated

This is a masterclass from Roger Federer. Theyre underway on Court 1, meanwhile. Can Berdych stun Djokovic

Roger Federer earns a break point with a glorious backhand pass. Milos Raonic, desperate not to go for the Federer forehand, runs around a backhand and plonks a forehand a few yards wide to drop his serve in the opening game of set two. This doesnt look its going to be an epic.

4.56pm BST

The sun breaks out from behind the clouds as Federer moves into a 30-0 lead, Raonic unable to do anything with a couple of returns. He swings a serve down the T to earn two set points. An ace down the middle, his fifth of the set, does the trick.Superb from Federer, who takes the first set 6-4. The Swiss has hit 14 winners and just two unforced errors so farUpdated

Milos Raonic volleys stoutly to hold after being taken to deuce, but Federers about to serve for the first set at 5-4. On Court 1, meanwhile, Novak Djokovic and Tomas Berdych are being wheeled out. Djokovic has a fairly healthy lead in their head-to-head: 25-2. Ouch.
