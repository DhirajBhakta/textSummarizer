Thugs Of Hindostan not based on Pirates of Caribbean: Aamir.
Aamir Khan's action-adventure film, Thugs Of Hindostan, is said to be based on the thug culture in 19th century India. The subject, many felt, was similar to Hollywood's Pirates Of The Caribbean series. At a recent media interaction, Aamir rubbished the rumours of his film being inspired by the Johnny Depp-starrer."The film is not inspired from any other film. It is an action adventure film but the story is not similar. There are some hundreds of action adventure films. There is Pirates Of The Caribbean, there is Indiana Jones and many others. The genre of our film is action adventure but the story is different. Even my character in the film is not similar to any other character," he said.Talking about his leading lady in Thugs Of Hindostan and onscreen daughter in Dangal, Fatima Sana Shaikh, Aamir said, "Fatima is the heroine of the film. I am very happy as she is a very good artist, she suits the role."Thugs of Hindostan, directed by Vijay Krishna Acharya, will also feature Amitabh Bachchan and Katrina Kaif in leading roles. The film is reportedly scheduled to release in 2018. (With inputs from IANS)
