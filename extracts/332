Was told I'm too good looking to look real in films: Kriti.
Although actor Kriti Sanon is just three films old, she has already been directed by some of the best filmmakers and co-starred with actors such as Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol. However, it wasnt an easy start for her, considering she had to face some bizarre criticism in the aspiring actor phase.There were some low phases in my life; there were films offered by big banners, but they were not the best debut projects. So, I had to tell myself that I should be patient and good things will happen to me, says Kriti, who was born and brought up in Delhi and shifted to Mumbai to try her luck in Bollywood.The actor, who turned 27 on Thursday, adds, There were days when I was annoyed and irritated. On some days, I used to cry, because there was nothing to keep me busy. There were also times when I met a few people who told me that something was not right about me  someone told me, Youre too good-looking. There has to be some sort of imperfection in you to look real on screen. I think I did feel low, but at the same time, I did have people who believed in me a lot. Thats what you need. I think that gave me a little more confidence. Kriti, who made her debut with Tiger Shroff in Heropanti (2014), went on to star in Dilwale (2015) and this years Raabta. Her personal life made headlines when she was linked up with her Raabta co-star Sushant Singh Rajput. Neither of them has ever accepted it publicly, and Kriti says that negative stories do affect her.I think Ive made peace with all these rumours, but having said that, Im also human and anything written about me does affect me. Though I know that the news is not true, being written in a negative way does make me feel bad. But its more important to move on from such things and focus on something exciting and positive, says Kriti, who will soon be seen in Bareilly Ki Barfi.Follow @htshowbiz for more
