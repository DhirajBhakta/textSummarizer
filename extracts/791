Forgetting people not in limelight is human nature: Diana.
Diana Penty follows her heart when it comes to selecting film roles. The actor is clear about one thing ?  she doesn?t want to portray similar characters. Therefore after Cocktail (2012), she took a break before signing her next, Happy Bhag Jayegi that released last year.?I can?t  choose my roles half-heartedly. It?s very important for me that the character I am playing must be of certain importance and different from my previous one.  Meera (Cocktail) is shy and demure, while Happy was loud, outspoken and wears her heart on her sleeve,? says Diana, adding that her next roles are different as well. ?In Lucknow Central, which highlights the story of a prisoner forming a music band, my character helps them reinvent and recognise their own talent. And in Parmanu I will be doing little bit of action, something that I have never done before,? she adds.     #FirstLook #Parmanu ?

It never bothered me. It?s my life and I prefer choosing my path. I don?t follow anyone else. I have my method when it comes to my work. I don?t think about who has done what, rather what I am doing is of utmost importance to me,? adds the model-turned- actor.    #FlashbackFriday #Cocktail #Movie A post shared by Diana Penty (@dianapenty) on Jun 23, 2017 at 4:42am PDTAnd if she doesn?t get offers of her choice after her fourth film, will she again take a break?  ?I don?t think that will happen now because at the moment I am getting the kind of work that makes me enthusiastic,? she says.
