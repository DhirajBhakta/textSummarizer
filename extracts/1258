Uphaar tragedy: SC gives 1 yr sentence to Gopal Ansal.
The Supreme Court on Thursday ordered one year in jail for city-based builder Gopal Ansal who with his elder brother, Sushil, owned a south Delhi cinema hall where a fire killed 59 people 20 years ago.Reviewing its 2015 judgment that saw the brothers, who owned Uphaar Cinema, being let off with a fine of Rs 30 crore each, the court said the jail term would act as a deterrent and serve larger public interest. He has four weeks to surrender.The court, however, allowed Sushil,76, to stay out of jail because of his age. He has already served a reduced sentence of five months.Gravity of the offence and the illegal gains made by them (Ansals) is such that no fine would be excessive for the irreparable loss caused, the bench said, upholding the Rs 60 crore fine.The money had already been paid and is lying with the courts registry.The three-judge bench of justice Ranjan Gogoi, justice Kurien Joseph and Justice AK Goel was hearing a petition filed by the CBI and the Association of Victims of Uphaar Tragedy against its August 19, 2015 order.The Ansals were found guilty of negligence but were not jailed, with the court treating the time spent by them behind bars as sentence served.While Sushil spent five months in jail. Gopal, 68, was behind bars for four months immediately after the June 13, 1997 tragedy.The owners, an investigation had found, added extra seats that blocked one of the exits, preventing the victims - 23 of them minors -- from escaping the burning hall after a fire broke out in the transformer room. Most of the victims were asphyxiated..UPAHAAR1_boxwrap {width:auto; height:400px; border:1px dashed #333; overflow:scroll; font-family: "Open Sans"; padding:10px; background-color:#eee7ce; float:left}.UPAHAAR1_box1 ul {width:93%; line-height:22px; text-decoration:none; list-style:url(http://www.hindustantimes.com/static/ht2016/10/bulletbrown1.png); margin:10px; padding-left:11px; font-size:100%; border-left:1px dashed #993333; float:left}.UPAHAAR1_h1 {font-size:110%; font-weight:normal; padding-left:5px; margin-bottom:10px}.UPAHAAR1_tophead {width:100%; font-size:140%; color:black; line-height:26px; font-weight:normal; margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:5px; padding-left:5px; margin-top:10px; float:left}.UPAHAAR1_text1 {width:98%; font-size:110%; color:#F00; font-weight:bold; margin-top:5px; padding-left:5px; float:left}.UPAHAAR1_img {width:auto; float:left}.cricketmargin {width:100%; height:10px; border-bottom:1px dotted #000; float:left}.clrboth {clear:both}Uphaar cinema fire case Association of Victims of Uphaar Fire Tragedy (AVUT) vs Ansal Theatre and ClubotelsJune 13, 1997: 59 people die of asphyxia as a fire breaks out in south Delhis Uphaar cinema during the screening of the Hindi movie "Border".
