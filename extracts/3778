Mahabharat is such an epic that I need to up my craftsmanship to handle such a subject. Yeah I met Aamir ji once quite sometime back and we spoke about Mahabharata. I know that he's very much interested in doing the film. But as I said, at present I am not thinking anything beyond Baahubali. Mahabharata is definitely not after this."Interestingly, Aamir Khan himself expressed his desire to work with Rajamouli during the promotion of Dangal. He said, "I am a huge fan of Rajamouli's work and if he ever plans to make Mahabharata, I'd love to play Krishna or Karna. I might actually go with Krishna." If things fall into place, Mahabharata will be one of the biggest films in the history of Indian cinema.Meanwhile, Rajamouli awaits the release of Baahubali: The Conclusion, which is slated to release on April 28.Made on a lavish budget of Rs 200 crore, Baahubali: The Conclusion has already yielded profits for the producers even before its release and reportedly raked in Rs 500 crore.The film has Prabhas, Rana Daggubati, Anushka Shetty and Tamannah in the lead, while Ramya Krishnan, Sathyaraj and Nasser play pivotal roles.WATCH Baahubali vs Bhallala Deva: Prabhas and Rana Daggubati arm-wrestle it out
