Salman's nephew Ahil's 1st birthday celebrated in Maldives.
Ahil Sharma is the blue-eyed boy of Khan-daan, and as he turned 1, the entire family took off to Maldives to ring in his birthday. Mom Arpita Khan Sharma and dad Aayush Sharma are joined by Salman Khan and his rumoured girlfriend Iulia Vantur. The big gang that landed in Maldives also includes Arbaaz Khan, Malaika Arora, Atul Agnihotri, Alvira Khan Agnihotri, Helen and Seema Khan. Salman, who is a doting mamu, took a 22-hour flight to be with Ahil on his birthday. The 51-year-old actor took a mini-break from his Tiger Zinda Hai schedule and immediately flew from Austria to be a part of the celebration.Ahil's birthday crew ! #ahilturns1 @amillafushiA post shared by Arpita Khan Sharma (@arpitakhansharma) on Mar 29, 2017 at 7:06am PDT Even mom Arpita couldn't contain her happiness and shared a lovely message, "Here wishing my love,my life, my world,my lil man who's given me a reason to believe in love, life and togetherness forever.
