Not like I bought the car and took Kriti for a ride: Sushant.
Reams of newsprint have been dedicated to Sushant Singh Rajput and Kriti Sanon's rumoured relationship. The Raabta co-stars have repeatedly denied being in a relationship, but to no avail. When Sushant was clicked taking Kriti for a spin in his new swanky car, rumour mills went into an overdrive. Sushant opened up about in an interview with Mumbai Mirror."It's not like I bought the car and took Kriti for a ride," he laughed. "I had taken the car out for a spin alone the day it was delivered. Nobody clicked any pictures then."For the last few weeks, stories of Sushant and Kriti's relationship going kaput were doing the rounds. Photos of their long drive made people think they had decided to rekindle their dying out romance. Sushant laughed, "I read about this thing between us, then there were stories about a fight and a break-up and then suddenly, probably because of the Maserati we were back together."He added, "They are all very interesting but untrue. We are good friends. She's an engineer and I was studying to be one too before I dropped out. We're both from Delhi, big foodies and like spending time together. Period."
