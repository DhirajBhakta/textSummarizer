Weeks after chief minister Devendra Fadnavis survived two helicopter accidents, the Maharashtra government plans to undertake an audit of helipads across the state. The state also plans to introduce a handbook detailing a standard operating procedure to provide security to VIPs. The move comes after the issue was raised by Congress MLC Sharad Ranpise, who said he was concerned over the condition of landing sites in the state. ?Helicopters are being grounded near high-tension wires and transformers. This is risky,? he said.Fadnavis said a policy is in the process of being framed.
