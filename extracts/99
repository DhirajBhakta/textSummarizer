Gujarat Congress MLAs in Bengaluru not allowed to go out.
Bored in confines of a sprawling resort in Bengaluru, the Congress flock of 44 MLAs is a frustrated lot now. Following strict orders of the Karnataka Power Minister DK Shivakumar, the MLAs are not allowed to venture out in the city. While the minister is presently in New Delhi to seek further course of action, 30 MLAs have been put in-charge of the discipline. But few defiant MLAs did head out in the city for sightseeing, shopping, to visit temples, much to the dismay of those still under curbs. The MLAs who were allowed to go out are supposedly those, the Congress is confident of not ditching the party.
