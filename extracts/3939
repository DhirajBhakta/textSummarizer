Raj newborn declared dead, starts crying before cremation.
In Rajasthan's Bundi district, a shocking incident shed some light on the sad state of affairs of the health department. A woman had to give birth in the absence of a doctor in a government hospital in Bundi, and the male nurse who assisted her during the delivery told her that her child was dead and should be taken to the burial ground. All this happened in the absence of a doctor. Following the male nurse's advice, the family took the new born for the burial. But few minutes before the burial the child started crying and that's when everyone realised that the baby girl is still alive. They again went to the hospital and complained against the male nurse who misguided them. When the deputy superintendent saw a ruckus, he went on to defend the nurse and said that since the child is born weak, there are hardly any chances of survival. He in fact did not even try saving the newborn's life.Residents of Bundi district are appalled by this incident of negligence and questioned the hospital authorities that if the infant had not cried before the burial then because of the wrong information given to them, the family would have buried her alive. Not only that, deliveries being done in the absence of doctors raises many questions about the functioning of the hospital. Deputy controller Dr OP Verma defended his staff and said that the baby girl was born premature and since there was no movement at the time of birth, she was declared dead. However, the family members believe that if immediately after delivery the infant would have been shifted to the ICU then her health would not have deteriorated.
