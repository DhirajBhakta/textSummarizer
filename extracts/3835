Arpita shares childhood pic with her brother Salman Khan.
Their bond is unbreakable, and this throwback picture is a perfect proof of it. It might not be a Thursday, but Salman Khan's sister Arpita Khan was in a mood to share a throwback picture with her bhaijaan. Arpita took to Instagram to share an adorable picture from her childhood. Now a mother, Arpita looks almost unrecognisable in this old picture where she is seen hugging Salman. In fact, Sohail Khan also makes an appearance in the frame with his nerdy glasses.?? @beingsalmankhanA post shared by Arpita Khan Sharma (@arpitakhansharma) on Apr 11, 2017 at 6:50am PDT It was only recently that reports of Arpita being upset with Salman were doing the rounds. Buzz has it that Arpita was hopeful that Salman will launch her husband Aayush Sharma in Bollywood, but he decided otherwise. However, Arpita has shut her detractors with his perfect picture. On the work front, Salman is currently busy shooting for Ali Abbas Zafar's Tiger Zinda Hai.
