"What will our workers do on those 105 seats They have all worked hard, what will happen to them now. This is not right, I will not let the party be destroyed like this," the Samajwadi Party patriarch said.While nomination for the first two phases of the Uttar Pradesh election has ended, Mulayam's directive means the Congress may have to face his candidates in the remaining five phases.The threat from Mulayam came a day after he expressed his unhappiness with the Samajwadi Party-Congress coalition and said he will not campaign for it."This alliance will destroy Samajwadi Party," he said. "I fought a lifelong battle to establish the Samajwadi Party against the Congress."Mulayam said he is still trying to convince his son Akhilesh Yadav against going with the alliance.On Sunday, Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi and Akhilesh Yadav took out a joint roadshow in Lucknow after addressing a joint press conference.A furious Mulayam trashed the alliance and said it was "most unfortunate" that Akhilesh Yadav had done so in his quest to grab power.Also read:UP Assembly election: Won't campaign for SP-Congress alliance, says Mulayam Singh Yadav
