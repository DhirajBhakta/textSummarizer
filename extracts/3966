Man accuses Cyber Hub pub staff of beating friends .
A visit to The Wine Company at DLF Cyber Hub, Gurgaon, turned foul for three young men, who now claim they were brutally thrashed by the bouncers here for no good reason.Suryansh Jalan wrote a review on Zomato saying that three of his friends had gone to The Wine Company on Monday night at around 10pm. A little after midnight, when they called for the bill, they noticed there were some "inconsistencies" in the amount charged. Jalan wrote that, at this point, the restaurant's manager was summoned, after which "a heated, yet cordial argument" ensued between the two parties.Ultimately, the manager accepted the restaurant's error, gave them a corrected bill, which Jalan said his friends paid and headed for the door "as can be clearly viewed on the CCTV footage."From here, as Jalan claims, things started going south: "Seems like there was a misconception in the company staff, as the Manager tried to stop one of the friends by grabbing their arm, and when the individual tried to release himself from the strong grip of the Manager, around 8-10 highly aggressive, seemingly uneducated and brutish bouncers, decide to take matters into their own hands, and viciously jumped them NOT with the intent to restrict them, but rather to cause heavy and grievous harm."Though Zomato now has taken down this review, it is still appearing on The Plunge Daily.Jalan further added that the restaurant staff "broke several bottles on them," and that one of the bouncers slashed a deep cut in his friend's neck with a glass shard. After this 'assault' Jalan said his friends where "dragged" out of the restaurant to the DLF CyberHub's promenade, and left there, when one of his friends called the police.WHAT DOES THE WINE COMPANY HAVE TO SAY?In a Facebook post shared on Thursday, The Wine Company responded to the incident saying that they have "thoroughly investigated the matter" and come to the conclusion that it was the customers (Jalan's friends) who were "misbehaving" at the restaurant.The Wine Company claims that the three men had "consumed excessive amounts of alcohol" until 12.30am, some time after which they were told that that the restaurant was about to shut and that the liquor licensing hour was up. "On hearing this, the customers began misbehaving with our staff," said The Wine Company post. "Our wine sommelier, who started reasoning with them, was then abused verbally, pushed across the restaurant and struck repeatedly without provocation."The Wine Company claims that at this point, two bouncers intervened to take the three "extremely drunk and unruly" men out of the restaurant, with some assistance from the restaurant staff."Once outside the premises of the restaurant, the three picked fights with passer-by's and were injured in the subsequent scuffle," said the post.The Wine Company also claimed that it was their restaurant manager who called the police. Here is a CCTV footage they shared of the incident:WHAT DOES ZOMATO HAVE TO SAY?Zomato is said to have taken down Suryansh Jalan's review of the incident at The Wine Company because they "cannot allow second-hand dining experiences only or opinions based on a media report/ a third party's incident [sic]."Jalan shared a screenshot of Zomato's mail to him, in which the company "defends" the removal of Jalan's review on The Wine Company from their platform.In the mail, Zomato officials wrote that though the "regret" the "unfortunate incident" that happened with his friends, they won't be able to carry Jalan's review as it is against their guidelines.Here is a screenshot of Zomato's mail to Jalan:
