Doordarshan plans to replace its logo after 58 years.
Doordarshan, the state-owned broadcaster, is planning to change its iconic logo and create something youthful in a bid to tap the children of liberalisation, moving away from nostalgia.In an invitation issued on Monday evening, Doordarshan asked for entries from the public, seeking a new logo design to improve the look and feel of the network.Much of the population today is under 30 years of age. These are the children of liberalization who have not grown up with Doordarshan. They dont share the same nostalgia factor which the earlier generation did, said Shashi Shekhar Vempati, chief executive officer at public broadcaster Prasar Bharati, which runs Doordarshan and All India Radio.Story published in arrangement with Livemint.
