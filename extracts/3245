Dubai recruits world's first robot police officer.
Yes, it is true. Dubai will now have a robot patrolling the city streets as a police officer.The world's first operational robot police officer was officially inducted into the Dubai police force at the 4th Gulf Information Security Expo and Conference (GISEC) on Sunday.This robot -- or as it is know, the robocop -- is around 5-foot tall and weighs a 100kg. It can not only identify hand gestures from a distance of up to 1.5 metres, but can also detect people's emotions and facial expressions.In other words, the robocop can tell when you are happy, sad or even smiling, and will itself respond accordingly "to put people at ease".The robocop comes with other special features, such as its facial recognition software with which it can identify offenders. With this tool, the robocop can also broadcast live video feeds to the police command room. "With an aim to assist and help people in the malls or on the streets, the robocop is the latest smart addition to the force and has been designed to help us fight crime, keep the city safe and improve happiness levels," a Gulf News report quotes Brigadier Khalid Nasser Al Razouqi, General Director of the Smart Services Department at Dubai Police.Brigadier Khalid Nasser Al Razooqi on @DubaiPoliceHQ launching their Robocop and their vision for security and safety. #GISEC2017pic.twitter.com/eMFf2bRZBCThe newly-recruit robocop can speak in six different languages. Apart from being able to chat with people, the robocop can also shake your hand and offer a millitary salute.Needless to say, the robocop's in-built integrated system will have it connected to social media and other applications.At this point, we won't be even surprised if the robocop can also tap dance.
