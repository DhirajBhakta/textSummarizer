What do you need Champions Trophy for, asks Ravi Shastri.
Stating that there were too many ICC events at present, Ravi Shastri felt there was no need to conduct the Champions Trophy, which is scheduled in England from June 1."If you ask me, five years down the line there will be very little 50-over cricket. There are too many ICC tournaments. Which event (sport) has so many World Champions," said the former Indian team director on Monday. (Rs 2 crore is peanuts: Ravi Shastri wants steep pay hike for Indian cricketers)Shastri, who spoke to reporters on the sidelines of a promotional event of "Greycells Education", in which he is a mentor and advisor, felt that the quadrennial ICC World Cup gets diluted by the existence of the Champions Trophy."I go and meet anyone on the street and am asked 'kitna World Cup hai yaar' (how many World Cups are there), 'World Champion hai kaun' (who is the World Champion), which is a fact. You have both the Champions Trophy and the World Cup. You are (thus) diluting the World Cup," he said."World Cup, T20, Test cricket are fine. What do you need Champions Trophy for? What are you trying to prove? Who remembers (who won them in the past)?"If you ask me about the last 10-12 World Cups (winners), I will tell you, (but) you ask me (about) the last three Champions Trophy (winners) - I don't know. The last one (in England in 2013) I will tell, because India won," he explained.Shastri said people remember World Cup champions and not who had won past Champions Trophy events."I don't have a clue and I have broadcast (commentated) in all of them. World Cup in 2011 and the (winning) six (which India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni struck in the final at the Wankhede Stadium against Sri Lanka). That you will (always) remember," he pointed out.
