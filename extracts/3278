Tendulkar refused to act when first approached for biopic.
Sachin Tendulkar's bipoic is set to release next week and the Master Blaster has revealed he had denied to "act" in the film when he was first approached for 'Sachin: A Billion Dreams'.Tendulkar, who is known for having a protective approach of his privacy, is excited with his biopic which will relive the some of the most crucial moments from his life on and off the field. The making off the film started in 2012 and will hit the theatres on May 26."When Ravi (Bhagchandka, producer) met me in 2012, his idea was that the life of other sports personalities have been covered so there should be a film on my life. My first reply was: 'But I am not going to act'. It took me a while to say yes," Tendulkar told PTI in an interview."I continue to be slightly uncomfortable (to talk about myself). That's why I have got other guys to talk about me. I always wanted to play cricket for India. Rest of the things happened around it. And when I got there, it was about winning the World Cup for India."This film is about that. It is about chasing my dreams. My dream was not only my dream, it was a dream shared by a billion plus people."The audience will also get to see the romance between him and his wife Anjali."The audience will get to see my romance with Anjali (Tendulkar). How I met my wife and how we took it forward is part of film."The biopic will show things that no one else had access to before. I had to speak with the whole family before coming out with this film. The most important objective is that the fans should have something to take back," Tendulkar had last week told India Today in an exclusive chat.The 44-year-old will dedicate the film to to his father and brother.Tendulkar's father used to tell him in his childhood that no matter if he has chosen cricket in his life, what would matter in the end is how virtuous he was as a person.
