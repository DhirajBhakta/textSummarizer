They want women who would be comfortable with cleaning houses naked. Naturist Cleaner vacancy ad has gone viral ever since they announced that they are paying 45 pounds an hour (around Rs 3,770) for women "of all ages and figures" who would clean "private houses across the UK" wearing nothing but slippers and gloves."It's a service for the nudist community. We are a cleaning company. There's nothing sexual about the business at all," said owner Laura Smith.Nudist clients who take this 'service' are charged 65 pound for the first hour (around Rs 5,400) and 55 pounds per hour (around Rs 4,600) from then on. And the golden 'no touching' rule ensures that everyone keeps their hands to themselves.Parallel services of Naturist Cleaner include packages in which the owners can be naked as well, while the cleaning staff polish their windows and make their beds on nude-mode.A Telegraph report says that Smith had this idea after a nudist client "asked if he could be naked while she cleaned for him".
