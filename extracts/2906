Our bond is too personal: Anil on Sonam's rumoured boyfriend.
Sonam Kapoor and Anand Ahuja's relationship has been the talk of the town for a while now. It is no secret that Sonam's family is quite fond of Anand and he is often spotted on holidays with the Kapoors. Anil Kapoor recently talked about his relationship with his daughter's boyfriend in an interview with Pune Mirror.He said, "It is not my place to speak about Anand, that is entirely Sonam's prerogative and I have not known her to speak about her personal life. All I can say is that Anand and I are both private people and the bond we share is too personal for me to discuss with the media."Sonam celebrated her birthday with Anand earlier this month, and it looked like her beau made her evening very special. Their relationship came in the spotlight when they made an entry together at Akshay Kumar's Rustom success bash.However, neither of them has openly admitted to being together. When Sonam asked on Koffee with Karan about the "conjecture" that she has been dating a "business-boy from London," she laughed, "I am always dating a businessman from London." She went on to say that she likes to keep her private life private and she will never talk about it.
