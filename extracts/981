Pakistan's High Court lifts ban on airing Indian TV serials.
A ban on airing Indian shows in Pakistan has been lifted by a Pakistani court. The said ban had been imposed by Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (PEMRA), following the Uri attacks last year. The blanket ban had been put in place last October.However, a Lahore high court recently objected to the ban saying that a ban on anti-Pakistan content is understandable, but a blanket ban is not needed.The court said that "the world has become a global village" and asked how long "unreasonable restrictions" can be imposed, Dawn reported.
