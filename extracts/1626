PM Narendra Modi cannot do Yoga: Rahul Gandhi.
Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday took a jibe at Prime Minister Narendra Modi's professed love for yoga and raised doubts over the latter's ability to do the ancient form of exercise.Delivering the inaugural speech at Congress' Jan Vedna Sammelan here, Rahul said Modi does not do "padmasan", a form of yoga.He said, "Mai baatein notice karta hoon. Bahut yoga kia (PM ney) lekin padmasan nahi kia (I notice things. The PM has done a lot of yoga but he hasn't done padmasan)."Rahul went on to raise a question mark over PM Modi's ability to do yoga.He said, "Mere yoga guru ne kaha tha jo yoga karta hai woh padmasan kar sakta hai aur jo yoga nahi karta woh padmasan nahi kar sakta (My yoga guru had said that a person who does yoga can do padmasan. But a person who does not do yoga cannot do padmasan)."Also read: Rahul Gandhi missing in action ahead of Uttar Pradesh, Punjab elections. Does he not care?
