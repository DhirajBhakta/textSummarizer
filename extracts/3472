The source said that in the legal notice Pakistan had pointed out that the BCCI didn't honour the MOU despite it being signed in the presence of the ICC officials."The notice also says that due to India's repeated refusal to commit itself to the MOU, three series have not been played since 2015 two of them which Pakistan was supposed to host," he said.
