Over 20-yr-old museum may be shifted to Mumbai zoo.
The Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST) is planning to shift its iconic museum from the Anik Bus Depot at Wadala to Byculla zoo. Authorities said bringing the museum to the heart of the city would attract more visitors and rake in some revenue. Rani Baug is visited by thousands of people all through the week and during the weekends. This will also help promote BEST buses, said a BEST official.The museum at the Anik is more than 20 years old, and houses old bus tickets, models of the electric tram, ticket dispensing machines and historical photographs showing of BEST buses over the years. The authorities want to shift the museum to the building where the zoos latest attraction, the Humboldt penguins, are kept. BEST authorities said it has asked the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) for space on the second floor of this building. The Anik bus depot museum is far away, and people have often complained they dont visit as the travel is a pain. This is why we have asked for space at Rani Baug. said Anil Kokil, BEST committee chairman.
