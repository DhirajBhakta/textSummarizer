Amol Palekar moves SC seeking relaxation in film censorship.
Veteran actor Amol Palekar filed a PIL with Supreme Court questioning the censorship laws that have not been contested for over 47 years now. The 72-year-old actor has sought relaxation in the censorship of films by means of removal of pre-censorship of movies. According to a report in Scroll, Palekar in the petition has pointed out the absence of a member with a legal background in CBFC which often leads the board to repeatedly violate filmmakers' fundamental right to speech and expression. Palekar has further challenged the provisions of the Cinematography Act, calling the pre-censorship of films irrelevant in the internet era. The Supreme Court has now issued a notice to the censor board asking them to file a reply to Palekar's plea.Palekar has been missing from silver screen for quite some time now. He was recently in the news for his documentary Bhinna Shadja, on late singer Kishori Amonkar, when she passed away earlier this month.
