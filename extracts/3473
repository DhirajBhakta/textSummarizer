Cong top brass chose me over Sheila Dikshit: Ajay Maken.
Delhi Congress chief Ajay Maken on Wednesday indicated that his resignation was not accepted as the party high command chose him over former chief minister Sheila Dikshit. On Wednesday, Maken called a meeting of all of party's councillors and the candidates who lost in MCD polls to chalk out party's plans for the future. Responding to questions on rift and dissent in the Congress, Maken said, "After my resignation, the party high command listend to me and simultaneously spoke to Sheila ji. After this, I was asked to continue to as the Delhi Pradesh Congress Committee chief."His statement seems to be a direct attack on former Delhi Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit, who had criticised Maken for 'ignoring' party's senior leaders during the MCD election campaign.

However, the party high command had rejected his resignation and he was asked to continue as party's state unit chief.Maken said he would carry out a reshuffle in the party to strengthen its base in Delhi.
