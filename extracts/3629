Don't celebrate MCD win: BJP to cadre after Sukma attack.
The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has asked its supporters not to celebrate any victories out of respect for the 25 Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) who were martyred in a Maoist ambush attack in Chhattisgarh's Sukma district on Monday.The saffron party's appeal comes just ahead of the counting of votes in the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) election, which the BJP is expect to win comfortably. The India Today-Axis My India exit poll predicted that the BJP would win as many as 202 to 220 of the 270 wards in which voting took place on Sunday.The poll indicated that the BJP's main rivals, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and the Congress, would win 23 to 25 seats, and 19 to 31 seats, respectively.There was more good news for the BJP on Monday, when Delhi University's Developing Countries Research Centre also predicted a  landslide victory for party - led by Manoj Tiwari in the national capital - in all three Delhi corporations.But after communist guerillas on Monday killed over two dozen CRPF bravehearts in Chhatisgarh, the BJP's cadre and followers may not celebrate if these predictions turn out to be accurate.ALSO READ | CRPF, which lost its 25 jawans in Sukma Naxal attack, is without a full-time chief for almost two months nowALSO READ | PM Modi on Sukma attack: Sacrifice of CRPF jawans will not go in vainALSO READ | MCD 2017 exit poll results: India Today-Axis My India predicts big win for BJP, massive setback for AAP, Congress
