Gujarat Assembly speaker slams Cong MLAs over B'luru retreat.
Speaker of Gujarat Assembly Ramanlal Vohra today criticised the Opposition for pinning the blame on BJP after six Congress MLAs resigned this week just ahead of Rajya Sabha polls. Speaking to India Today, Vohra said "I am performing my duty properly and before accepting the resignations of all 6 MLAs, I had word with them and asked them specifically is there any pressure on them? Or has someone offered them money to resign? I got answer from them that they are tendering resignation by their own will and not under any pressure."Vohra also added that he is getting unknown phone calls, "They are asking me to accept resignation whichever comes to me. I told them that I will follow my duties properly and will ask them few questions before accepting their resignation."'NOT THE TIME FOR POLITICS' No new resignation has been tendered since late Saturday, July 29, but Congress did send two more MLAs to the Bengaluru resort, joining the other 40 there.
