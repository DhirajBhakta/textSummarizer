Australia will come hard at Kohli in first Test: Ganguly.
Former India captain Sourav Ganguly has already claimed that India can whitewash Australia 4-0 in the upcoming Test series but he has also cautioned Virat Kohli, saying the visitors will come hard at him in the first Test in Pune.CLICK TO WATCH FULL VIDEOKohli had to face a barrage of verbal volleys from the Aussies during the 2014-15 tour Down Under but that only made him more hungry to score runs and he did so in style, slamming four centuries in as many matches.While Ganguly feels the sledging won't affect Kohli too much but he is certain that Steve Smith and his team will try and make life as difficult for the Indian captain as possible."I'm not sure it's going to make any difference to Virat Kohli. They targeted him in Australia and he came back and played superbly. For me it was the life changing series for Kohli and since then he's been a terrific player. They might come back hard at him, they will do that in the first Test match but they'll have to keep winning and competing as well against India because if they don't compete then that fire power will slowly fizzle away as the series progresses," Ganguly told India Today in an exclusive interview.
