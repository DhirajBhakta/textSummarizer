Tharoor's 'farrago of distortions' quote not original.
When a newly launched TV channel resorted to salacious reporting on the Sunanda Pushkar murder case, Congress leader Shahi Tharoor came out with dictionaries blazing, and dropped a supremely viral tweet on the country."Exasperating farrago of distortions, misrepresentations&outright lies being broadcast by an unprincipled showman masquerading as a journalst," he wrote, sending half of Twitter scurrying to Google the meaning of "farrago" and make some sense of the clearly brutal tweet.Legendary memes and endless jokes were born, and Tharoor himself was pretty amused with the ripples he created.Thanks, tweeple, for finding humour in my exasperation! Outrage was never so funny:https://t.co/WfwWwBqkwLBut while the country was still learning to use "farrago" in day to day conversations, we learned that those four magical words had been used before.
