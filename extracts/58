Can't believe a normal hug with Salman was trending: Sana.
Actor Sana Khan was up for a not-so-pleasant surprise on Tuesday, when a video of her hugging actor Salman Khan went viral for all the wrong reasons. Sana walked the red carpet at a recently held TV awards show in Mumbai, and when she spotted Salman, the two exchanged a hug. What made it news was Salmans closed fists, and his shy smile. I still cant believe that a normal hug was trending, trolling, and rolling, says Sana. People just blew it out of proportion because [Salman] had a closed fist, and some dumb people even called it an awkward hug. The actor adds that its only normal for people to wear backless clothes at a red carpet event.

Its not [as if] I went to hug him and he didnt recognise me.But why that closed fist Couldnt it be somebodys style Maybe he hugs like that. I dont know. I think the best person [whom] to ask this would be Salman. [Also] He has been in the [film] industry for over 25 years, so dont think backless even matters to him he has seen more than that (laughs). Lets not talk like a five-year-old and make all this sound so big, says Sana.Im not a psychopath to hug somebody if the person doesnt want to talk to me. Im not someone who makes people stand and keep talking and falling on their lap.Sana has known Salman ever since she first appeared in 2012 on the reality show Bigg Boss (which was hosted by Salman) and later worked with the actor in the 2014 film Jai Ho. Lashing out at those who are calling it a forced hug, Sana retorts, Im not a psychopath to hug somebody if the person doesnt want to talk to me. Im not someone who makes people stand and keep talking and falling on their lap. I am on good terms with Salman; we share a rapport, I talk to him on and off, weve met so many times, Ive been to his house, and we have worked together on the sets also. So theres nothing to feel awkward [about].The actor shares that she had a brief two-minute chat with Salman, and that may have got everyone curious. For a moment, Salman didnt recognise me  he literally told me that. [Then] he complimented me that I look very nice. And I said, Yes, Ive dropped 7kg, and he is like, Its showing, reveals Sana.Was it the backless outfit that made the hug look awkward Sana says, Well, could be. Maybe he didnt want my back bronzer to fall on his clothes. He has worked with all sexy and good-looking actresses, who would use bronzer from head to toe, so he knows that. And its not that he wants to feel me up or I want to feel him up. I am sorry, we have all grown up from that zone. We need to respect each others space and gestures.Follow @htshowbiz for more
