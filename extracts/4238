I was comfortable mouthing expletives onscreen: Vidya .
Mumbai, Mar 14 (PTI) Vidya Balan will be seen mouthing expletives in her upcoming film "Begum Jaan", but the actress says she was comfortable with that as it was the demand of the character. Vidya plays the role of a brothels madam in the film, set against the backdrop of freedom struggle. The action-drama is written and directed by National award winning filmmaker Srijit Mukherji and is the remake of Bengali film "Rajkahini". "All the abuses which I cant give otherwise, I said it here," Vidya joked at the trailer launch of the movie. The actress said expletives are not uncommon in that area her character comes from so they stuck with that. "The place where she comes from she abuses a lot and easily. Its no big deal. When I was playing the role there was no apprehension with regards to the language. I cant be Begum Jaan and speak shayarana Urdu." Vidya said the entire team of the film worked hard to get the perfect look for her character. "There is no contribution of mine in it (the look). Srijit had a certain vision for Begum Jaan in mind. She is from Punjab, so the costumes were made from fabrics sourced from authentic places.
