Google to launch its next Pixel smartphone this year.
Last year Google bid farewell to the iconic Nexus line-up of smartphones in favour of the Pixel and Pixel XL - the first devices designed and conceptualised in house by the company.Designed as premium smartphones and with a price to match, the Pixel and Pixel XL are designed to represent Google's version of a perfect Android smartphone, with the hardware and software seamlessly working together.While we are still a long time from the launch of the Pixel 2, latest rumors indicate that the successor to the Pixel will see key improvements in major areas such as the processor and camera and will remain a premium device.Google's head of hardware Rick Osterloh confirmed to Android Pit that the Pixel devices will stay premium and there will not be a budget Pixel phone in the near future, with the company leaving lower price points for other hardware manufacturers.Also Read:  Top 10 phones announced at MWC 2017: Nokia 6, Moto G5, LG G6 and moreHe also hinted at a fall announcement for the Pixel 2 by saying " There is an annual rhythm in the industry. So, you can count on us to follow it. You can count on a successor this year, even if you don't hear a date from me now".The current Pixel duo lack some key features which we would like to see in their successor such as dust/water resistance, optical image stabilisation, wireless charging and stereo speakers.Google could also do with reducing the size of the bezels and tweaking the current 'love it or hate it' design.The Pixel and XL come with everything expected of a flagship smartphone in today's times - 4GB of RAM, a 5.0'/5.5' AMOLED display with Gorilla Glass 4 on top, 32/128GB of internal storage and the Snapdragon 821 processor.The Google Pixel comes with Google Assistant, Google's answer to the Siris and Cortanas of the world. Assistant builds upon Google Now's foundation but takes things up several notches.
