AAP MLA Prakash Jarwal booked for molestation .
Delhi Police have registered an FIR against AAP legislator from Deoli, Prakash Jarwal, after a 53-year-old woman filed a complaint accusing the MLA of touching her inappropriately and threatening her.The FIR registered on Wednesday is the second such case against him. In July 2016, a woman had made similar allegations against Jarwal. In her complaint, the woman alleged that on July 19, MCD officials had come to demolish an illegal construction near her house. She alleged that at the time, Jarwal came to her house along with around 40 persons and said that her son had abused him. The MLA threatened to sack her husband, who works with the Delhi Jal Board, and also touched her inappropriately, the complaint said. In the recent MCD elections, my son had danced in a rally of another party. A local councillor saw him and there was a quarrel. They called Jarwal and his goons. We had an argument with the MLA and the police were called. We reached a compromise then, but since then, we are being harassed, the woman told Hindustan Times. The MLA, meanwhile, said that the charges were politically motivated. The woman is a BJP worker and president of the block. Her husband and son had troubled our candidate some months ago during the MCD election. Our candidate had also filed a complaint, but it was withdrawn later. Her son and husband had abused us while we were celebrating our win after the election. And now, she is making these baseless allegations, Jarwal said.Police sources said the woman had a similar altercation with the area councillor some months ago. The police have not even told me that a case has been registered against me. I know they wont call me for interrogation, they will just arrest me, Jarwal said, adding that the woman was a BJP volunteer who wanted to make political gains.He said that though he was near the womans house on July 14, it was the woman and her family members who had abused him.
