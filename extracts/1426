BJP promises Ram Mandir in Ayodhya if it wins majority in UP.
The BJP today once again raked up the contentious Ram temple issue ahead of the first phase of the crucial seven-phase Uttar Pradesh election starting February 11.The party said a "grand" temple will be built in Ayodhya if the party comes to power with clear majority in India's most populous state."Ram Mandir is a subject of faith. It is not going to be built in two months. The temple will be constructed after the elections. The BJP will come to power with a full majority," the party's Uttar Pradesh chief Keshav Prasad Maurya told reporters in New Delhi.Last week, the chief priest of the makeshift temple at the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid site in Ayodhya said Hindu saints in Uttar Pradesh will support the BJP if Prime Minister Narendra Modi promises to get the Ram temple constructed."After the Modi government took over, we hoped that now the temple would be constructed. Modi must visit Ayodhya, give us a guarantee and announce that that he will get the Ram temple constructed during his tenure," Acharya Satyendra Das said.
