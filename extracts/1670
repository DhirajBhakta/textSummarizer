What Guj achieved in 5yrs, we will do in a year: TN Minister.
Emphasising that there is need to do away with the stereotypes about the people of south India, Tamil Nadu Education Minister K Pandiarajan said that the state is as pro-entrepreneurship as any other state in the country including Gujarat.Pandiarajan said that Tamil Nadu is working hard to attract huge foreign investment to give a boost to economic growth in the entire south India.Responding to a query from the audience, Padiarajan said, "We will have global investors' meet in September. We have started working to make it a big success. We will achieve this year itself what Gujarat did in five years- bringing Rs 5 lakh crore of foreign investment."Pandiarajan said that there was a notion about the south Indian people in rest of the country about their attitude and entrepreneur behaviour."It is wrong to think, as many do in the north, that south Indians are weak in body and arrogant in mind. That, they are not entrepreneurs. We are as good in business as any other states in the country. We need to rebrand and reposition ourselves," said the Tamil Nadu minister.Participating in the debate on 'Southern Success Story' at the India Today Conclave South in Chennai, Vikram Kirloskar, the vice-chairman of Toyota Kirloskar Motors, said that despite several claims about Gujarat, there were several areas where they were zero while Tamil Nadu and other southern states were the leaders.Bharat Biotech's chairman and managing director Krishna Elaa also took part in the discussion. Ela underscored the need to bring school education in consonance with the industries' demands of the work force.WATCH VIDEO HEREALSO READ | As talks of Sasikala heading Tamil Nadu grow louder, CM Panneerselvam says will follow Amma's path
