Ladies golf body slammed after ban on deep necklines, minis.
The Ladies Professional Golf Association (LPGA) has come in for stiff criticism after it introduced a new dress code that forbids female golfers from sporting plunging necklines, leggings or revealing skirts on the course.Initial reactions were overwhelmingly negative, with Teen Vogue accusing the governing body?s policy of ?slut-shaming? female players. The progressive and influential youth magazine also said the code sets players and women in general ?way back?. As of 17 July, the LPGA will crack down on athletic wear following a 2 July email to all players from LPGA player president Vicki Goetze-Ackerman, which detailed an extensive list of clothing that will no longer be allowed on course and at pro-am parties on the tour.Any transgression of the new code, as revealed in a report by Golf Digest, will result in a $1,000 fine for the first offence, with fines doubling for each subsequent breach. Items in the new code were expressed in the following dot points in Goetze-Ackerman?s email:Explaining the new code, Heather Daly-Donofrio, the LPGA tour?s communications and tour operations officer, told Golf Digest: ?The dress code requires players to present themselves in a professional manner to reflect a positive image for the game.? "Skirt, skort & shorts MUST be long enough to not see your bottom area" My Sunday school teacher, Sister Margaret, writing #LPGA dress code??While we typically evaluate our policies at the end of the year, based on input from our players, we recently made some minor adjustments to the policy to address some changing fashion trends. The specifics of the policy have been shared directly with the members.?Former European men?s tour player Matt Blackey was sceptical of the new regulations, tweeting ?I?m not sure a stricter dress code will help golf?s appeal,? while golf writer Robert Lusetich tweeted that his former Sunday school teacher must have been writing the code.
