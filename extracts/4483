Mohd Ali's son detained at US airport, asked if he's muslim.
In a shocking development, the son of legendary boxer Muhammad Ali was detained for four hours by immigration officials in Florida earlier this month and repeatedly asked about his religion.Muhammad Ali, 44, and his mother Khalilah Camacho-Ali, the first wife of boxer, arriving at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport on February 7 after an event in Jamaica, when they were pulled aside while going through customs because of their Arabic sounding names, reports the USA Today quoting Ali's family friend and lawyer Chris Mancini.Camacho-Ali was let go after she showed them a photo of herself with her ex-husband, however, her son was not so lucky as he was badgered for two straight hours, where he was repeatedly asked, "Where did you get your name from?" and "Are you Muslim?"When Ali Jr. responded that yes, he is a Muslim, the officers kept questioning him about his religion and where he was born.Mancini said he and the Ali family are contemplating filing a federal lawsuit and are currently trying to find out how many other people have been subjected to the same treatment as Ali Jr.
