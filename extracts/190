Sad we are debating lynching and not Digital India: IUML MP.
Charges and counter charges flew in the Lok Sabha on Monday over the issue of lynchings, with the Opposition parties targeting the Modi government and the ruling side asserting that it was the responsibility of the state governments to deal with such crimes.During the discussion, Congress MP Mallikarjun Kharge criticised the Prime Minister for not talking about the issue enough and listed the various incidents of lynchings across the country.  BJPs Hukmdev Narayan Yadav defended the governments response and, referring to political killings  in Kerala, questioned why only certain incidents were considered lynchings.In the Rajya Sabha, after initial uproar  over the alleged kidnapping of MLAs by police in Gujarat, the house adjourned briefly before resuming Question Hour.Congress Madhusudhan Mistry alleged that his party MLAs were being kidnapped and offered Rs 10-15 crore with a view to influence their vote in the August 8 elections to send three members from the state to the Rajya Sabha.Here are the highlights: 6:30 pm: Lok Sabha adjourned for the day.6:29 pm:The more you are raising the issue, the veil of the opposition is getting unveiled.
