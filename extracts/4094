EC transfers Chennai commissioner ahead of RK Nagar by-polls.
Chennai Police Commissioner Sebastian George has been transferred out of the city ahead of by-polls in former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa's constituency, Tamil media reports said on Saturday.This development comes after the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), the leading Opposition party in the the Tamil Nadu Assembly, told the Election Commission that the police commissioner might act in a way that favoured the ruling party - the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) - and asked that he be transferred, Puthiya Thalaimurai (PT) reported.The poll panel has said a new commissioner of police will be appointed soon, the news channel tweeted.RK NAGAR TO GO ON POLLS ON APRIL 12Jayalalithaa's constituency, Chennai's Dr Radhakrishnan (RK) Nagar, will elect a new MLA on April 12.With the polls just around the corner, as many as 127 nominations were filed on Friday, Thanthi TV reported.82 of those nominations, including those of DMK candidatate Maruthu Ganesh, and rival AIADMK candidates E Madhusudhanan and TTV Dinakaran, were accepted, the channel said.Madhusudhanan, a former Presidium Chairman, represents a faction of the AIADMK represented by former Chief Minister O Panneerselvam. TTV Dinakaran, the AIADMK's Deputy General Secretary, represents the faction led by party chief VK Sasikala.TWIN LEAF VERDICTThe Election Commission on Wednesday said neither camp could use the AIADMK's name or its symbol, the iconic 'Rettai Ilai' or 'twin leaf.'So the Panneerselvam and Sasikala camps will contest under the names 'AIADMK Puratchi Thalaivi Amma' and 'AIADMK Amma,' respectively.WHO IS GEORGE?Sebastian George is a 1984 batch officer who began his career in Tamil Nadu police force in 1987. George's way of handling protests and curbing unruly crowd, especially the way he handled the agitation against Kudankulam Nuclear PowerPoint and Mullaiperuyar issue, caught Jayalalithaa's attention.It is expected that ADGP (CB-CID) will be the new commissioner of Chennai.
