Fur coat worn by Titanic survivor sells for over 1 crore.
London, Apr 23 (PTI) A fur coat worn by a first class stewardess when the Titanic sank in 1912 has been sold for 150,000 pounds at an auction in the UK, almost double its original valuation of 80,000 pounds. Mabel Bennett, who was 33 at the time, was in her nightdress when the ship began to sink after hitting an ice berg. More than 1,500 passengers and crew died when the ship sank in April 1912, on its maiden voyage. She put on the beaver lamb fur coat she owned to keep her warm as she boarded lifeboat, the Telegraph reported. Bennett died aged 96 in 1974 and was the longest living female member of the crew. She passed the coat to her great niece in the 1960s as she found it too heavy to wear. The fur coat and letter of provenance went under the hammer yesterday at an auction at Henry Aldridge and Son in Devizes, Wiltshire. "This stunning coat is unique in that not only was it a personal possession of a Titanic crew member that was worn... but, to our knowledge, represents the only piece of exceptionally well provenance clothing from Titanic to ever come to auction," the auctioneers said.
