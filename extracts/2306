Shashi Tharoor, Derek O'Brien take 'dog filter challenge'.
The Rajya Sabha member from West Bengal representing the Trinamool Congress, Derek O'Brien thought to have "little bit of fun" on Instagram.The fun came soon after the Mumbai Police Cyber Cell registered an FIR against comedy group AIB co-founder, Tanmay Bhat. Comedian Tanmay Bhat came under fire after an AIB meme got viral which showed Prime Minister Narendra Modi using a dog filter on Snapchat. The meme was tweeted from AIB's official Twitter handle.On July 15, the old quiz show host tweeted sharing an Instagram photo. He tweeted, "It's the weekend. Time for a little bit of fun."A post shared by Derek O'Brien (@quizderek) on Jul 14, 2017 at 9:44pm PDTIt seems it wasn't Derek's idea to use the dog filter. OML Founder CEO Vijay Nair tweeted on July 14 saying 'he'd vote for any politician who uploads their photo with a dog filter'.Any politician who would voluntarily upload their pic with a dog filter right now gets my vote.On July 15, Derek O'Brien along with Shashi Tharoor was tagged in a tweet. The tweet asked both of them to "be a sport".@ShashiTharoor? Be a sport? @quizderek? https://t.co/g8Dxay8HMlThe jocular challenge excited TMC's Derek compelling him to think about spreading some good fun around, especially when the situation got uptight after AIB's Tanmay Bhat was booked for a meme of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.What a good idea . Giving it a thought. Should I ? Should I not ! Hmmm On itDerek gracefully applied the dog filter, the same filter which is landing people in jails in the present times. Derek replied thanking Vijay Nair for the idea and went ahead with it.Thanks for the idea . I just didAnd after Derek O'Brien, Shashi Tharoor too was game to post his photo with dog filter. Thiruvananthapuram MP Tharoor directed the tweet towards the trolls tagging AIB's Twitter handle.Attn all trolls: I took the #DogFilter challenge! @AllIndiaBakchodpic.twitter.com/0lmClCS7CF
