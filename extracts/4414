Delhi Metro to introduce music on Airport Line.
Delhiites may soon look forward to a soothing Metro commute during rush hours.The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation has decided to start playing music in stations on the New Delhi-Dwarka airport line and plans to extend it inside trains and across its network gradually, depending on user feedback.The decision to roll out instrumental music on the airport line  used by an average of 40,000 people a day  came after a public survey last year.As per the survey, 80% of the people desired to have light music in the station premises, the modalities for which are being worked out, said a Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) official.Sources say the facility may be rolled out in a month or two and the DMRC has already applied for a license from the Indian Performing Right Society and Phonographic Performance Limited. Depending on feedback, the music may soon be extended inside trains.These two companies give license if a public transport facility wants to play music. We have public address system in the entire metro network and playing music wont be a problem, the official added. The music will be on the lines of what plays in flights so that it doesnt annoy the passenger. Once we get the license, the facility will start at the airport line stations.The music is part of a turnaround in the airport line after the DMRC took over in June 2013. The daily ridership jumped from 9,000 to 40,000. Many VIPs including Union minister M Venkaiah Naidu, travelled on the line and have even tweeted photos. To attract passengers, the DMRC has revised the fares twice and made several other changes to ensure more people use this line. The maximum fare has been reduced to R 60 from R 180 and the minimum is now R 10 against r 30 in 2013.On August 12, the ridership reached a peak of 50,077. Passengers traveling with Air India and Jet Airways can also check-in from New Delhi and Shivaji stadium metro station.
