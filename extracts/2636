Nothing going on: Richa on rumours of dating Angad Bedi.
Richa Chadha has flatly denied rumours of a link-up with Inside Edge co-actor Angad Bedi. Richa and Angad were spotted together at the 6th edition of Sportsperson of the Year Awards 2017, along with actress Taapsee Pannu and shuttler PV Sindhu on Thursday. When prodded about the rumours, Richa told the media, "There is nothing going on like that."Angad simply nodded his head affirmatively. Rumours of Richa and Angad dating have been doing the rounds for a while now. A source was quoted as telling Mumbai Mirror a few days ago, "Richa recently moved to Versova (Mumbai) and Angad worked alongside the packers to smoothen out the process of settling into a new home for her. Since then she has been regularly dropping by a city studio where he is currently shooting for his next film and is a constant source of motivation."Richa and Angad's spokesperson told the tabloid, "They hadn't met until they started to work together and have been spending time together since. They have hit it off really well."Now, seems like it was all mere speculation. Angad and Richa will be seen together in upcoming web series Inside Edge, which will have cricket as its backdrop.Asked about their sports interests, Angad, son of former cricketer Bishan Singh Bedi, said, "I have a sports background, so obviously I have followed sports from childhood. I have been following the India-West Indies cricket tour and now also Wimbledon has started, I have been following that as well."Richa said, "I watch other sports events like Olympics if India is part of it. It isn't as though I don't have any interest in sports. I am interested in other things in life, so it's hard to find more time to add more interests. I enjoy cricket the most, then football, badminton and squash."ALSO READ: If Modi knew how women are harassed on Twitter, he would put a stop to it, says Richa Chadha
