World champion knocked out after kick to head, cries later.
Jon Jones had barely reclaimed his UFC title when he called out Brock Lesnar to be his next opponent.And Lesnar was listening.Right after Jones stopped Daniel Cormier in the third round at UFC 214 on Saturday, he reignited his growing rivalry with Lesnar, the former UFC heavyweight champion.Brock Lesnar, if you want to know what it feels like to get your ass kicked by a guy who weighs 40 pounds less than you, meet me in the octagon, Jones said on the pay-per-view broadcast.The Associated Press reached Lesnar shortly after he watched the championship fight and then heard Jones call him out.Be careful what you wish for, young man, Lesnar replied.A heavyweight superfight between Jones and Lesnar would be one of the biggest events in UFC history. Lesnar is an extraordinary pay-per-view draw as likely the most popular fighter in mixed martial arts, while Jones victory over Cormier is expected to put him back atop most pound-for-pound lists as the worlds best fighter.Lesnar returned to MMA last year with a victory, but he is under contract to the WWE as a professional wrestler until next spring.Jones and Lesnar traded verbal jabs earlier in the week. After Jones said he doubted Lesnar would ever accept a fight with him, Lesnar told the AP that he would meet Jones anytime, anywhere.Lesnar is at least considering a return to the sport in which he won a UFC title in just his fourth professional fight.UFC president Dana White was in the cage when Jones called out Lesnar, and the promotion is aware of the growing buzz surrounding the matchup. White is also aware of the obstacles in its way, including the remainder of Lesnars suspension for failing a doping test last year.Its fun to talk about, but the reality of it happening anytime soon, its not a reality, White said.But its definitely a lucrative possibility if Lesnar decides to resume training for MMA. Jones is the light heavyweight champion, but has long contemplated a move up to heavyweight  and his post-fight comments make it clear that hes interested.Lesnar beat Mark Hunt at UFC 200 in a unanimous decision that was changed to a no-contest after the failed test. He received a one-year suspension from the Nevada Athletic Commission, but could return to MMA after completing the final months of the ban.
