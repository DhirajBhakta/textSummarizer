Arnold slams Facebook troll insulting Special Olympics.
Don't mess with the Terminator or you will be put in your place.Recently, a social media video got viral on Thursday in which Arnold Schwarzenegger was seen celebrating the athletes who participated in the Special Olympics at the 2017 World Winter Games back in his home country Austria.Captioning the clip, "These guys inspire me!", Arnold shared the video on Snapchat. Arnie has been a vocal supporter of and has worked with the Special Olympics for many years."You all are truly the greatest athletes in the world!" -@Schwarzeneggerpic.twitter.com/21JWeI1dKkWhile most of the comments the video received were encouraging and positive, one rather hateful remark made towards the athletes really riled up Arnold Schwarzenegger.The comment read, "The Special Olympics make no sense. The Olympics are for the best athletes in the entire world to compete against each other to determine who is the best. Having retards competing is doing the opposite!"To this, Arnie replied, "Right now, I guarantee you that these athletes have more courage, compassion, brains, skill - actually more of every positive human quality than you."He went on to add, "I know what you really want is attention, so let me be clear: if you choose to keep going this way, no one will ever remember you."
