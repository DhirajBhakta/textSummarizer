Only 3,000 of 36 lakh farmers seek interim loan of ?10,000.
More than five weeks after it announced an interim loan of Rs10,000 to facilitate sowing of kharif crop until the actual waiver is credited in farmers? accounts, there seem to be no takers for government?s offer. While the government claimed more than 36 lakh farmers were eligible for the interim help, less than 3,000 of them have opted for it.With a decision on farm loan waiver pending, the government declared a Rs-10,000 interim loan for farmers for the sowing season. Taking note of the poor response, several district central cooperative banks (DCCBs) have published advertisements in newspapers, urging farmers to avail the loan. The government has also extended the deadline to claim the money to August 31 from the earlier July 15.The delay in issuing directions to banks owing to the failure in convincing RBI is to blame for this.?There is poor response to the interim waiver scheme. There was a delay in issuing directives to the district banks, but now the Maharashtra State Cooperative Bank has written to all DCCBs, saying it will avail the finances for such loans,? cooperation minister Subhash Deshmukh told HT. ?I think farmers are now waiting for the actual farm waiver than going for an interim offer.?The Congress said the interim loan waiver scheme failed owing to government apathy. ?Only 2,200 farmers could avail the interim loan. Many district cooperative banks and almost all nationalised and private banks have not shown any interest in the disbursement. The state took 25 days to extend guarantee to the banks for the loan that was announced on June 11. It is a failed initiative that has left farmers in the lurch,? said Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant.
