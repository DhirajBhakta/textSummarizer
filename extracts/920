Kamal Haasan made ambassador of Kabaddi team Tamil Thalaivas.
It might come as a surprise to many that actor-filmmaker Kamal Haasan is considering a career outside films. After making his splash on television as the host of reality show Bigg Boss, the Dasavatharam star is all set to be seen in a new role  as the ambassador of team Tamil Thalaivas (co-owned by Sachin Tendulkar) for the fifth season of Pro Kabbadi League. The team believes that Haasans association will be a great source of inspiration to put up a great fight in the league. In a statement, it was said that it was a unanimous choice to bring Haasan on board, given his love for sports.Talking about his association, Haasan said in the statement: I am honoured to associate myself strongly with the sport of Kabbadi. I take personal pride in highlighting the profile of a sport developed by my ancestors thousands of years ago. I am glad the team owners chose me. My dear Thalaivas fill your lungs with pride and cross the line to take the game across to international adulation.On the career front, Haasan will soon resume work on multi-lingual comedy Sabash Naidu, which had to be stalled last July after he fell from the stairs of his office in Chennai and fractured his leg. Amid rumours that the project has been shelved, Haasan recently confirmed that the film will be revived soon.Follow @htshowbiz for more
