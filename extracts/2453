Ola, Uber demand changes in Mumbai's City Taxi Scheme.
 About 300 Ola and Uber taxi drivers have sought state BJP president Raosaheb Danve?s  support for their opposition to  provisions of the City Taxi Scheme 2017. The scheme was introduced by the Maharashtra government to provide a level-playing field for all types of taxis and curb surge-pricing.The drivers urged Danve to convince the state government to make changes to the scheme or scrap it. Issues raised in the drivers? meeting with Danve included the price of cab permits, limiting operations of  cabs to within city limits, ban on diesel engines and conversion to CNG. Under the scheme, the state  has made it mandatory for  drivers using their vehicles for app-based taxi services like Ola and Uber, to register themselves with the transport authorities and follow several rules. The government is also in the process of fixing minimum and maximum fares that such cabs can charge commuters. This will affect business,  Ola and Uber drivers said.Yakub Mehta, administration, Action Committee of Maharashtra, said ?We received positive feedback from  BJP leaders. There are a series of measures in the scheme which, if implemented, will cause a lot of problems for tourist taxi drivers.?The drivers are scheduled to meet chief minister Devendra Fadnavis on Friday to discuss the matter.?It will be difficult for us to operate if the City Taxi Scheme is implemented. The supply of CNG is low throughout the state and we have been asked to convert to CNG. Also, why should we paint our vehicles a different colour when we are the owners of our cars? These are the issues that we need to discus with the chief minister,? said Amarjeet Singh from the ACM.Ola and Uber drivers had moved to the Bombay high court in June challenging the City Taxi Scheme 2017.
