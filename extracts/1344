Big B complains about Vodafone on Twitter, RJio offers SIM.
Bollywood actor Amitabh Bachchan has at least one Vodafone connection and it's giving him (some) trouble. The service is apparently so bad that Big B had to tweet about it. That he did. The last time he did something like this - on Twitter - Samsung had to replace his faulty Note 7, with a Galaxy S7 (of course). Something very similar happened this time round as well. VODAFONE WE HAVE A PROBLEM ..!! ALL SEND MESSAGES COMING FAILED .. RECEIVING SMS BUT NOT GOING .. HHEEEELLLLPPPPP !!!VODAFONE PROBLEM SOLVED ... THANK YOU .. ALL SMS GOING THROUGH NOW .... BAAAADDDDUUUMMBBAAA ...!!Interestingly, Reliance Jio was (also) quick to rise to the occasion, responding to big B's tweet saying it "would be happy to deliver a Jio SIM to him and activate it instantly through their Aadhaar based eKYC home delivery process." In fact, if you observe carefully, you'd notice it was among the first few handles to respond to Bachchan's tweet. Faster than Vodafone India, is what's important though.
