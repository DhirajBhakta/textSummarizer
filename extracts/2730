It was a moment to celebrate, not only for Aamir Khan fans but also Indians, when Dangal became the first Indian film to cross the Rs 2000-crore mark worldwide. However, Aamir's spokesperson has revealed that the figures, first published by Forbes magazine, are fake, and that the wrestling drama has not yet reached the milestone.The spokesperson said, "We have been reading a lot of reports saying that Dangal has crossed Rs 2000 crore worldwide. Just to set the record straight, we want to clarify that Dangal's official worldwide gross collection figure as of Thursday is Rs 1864 crore.""We are very happy that our film has been so successful, and what is of most value for Aamir Khan and the entire team of Dangal is the immense love the film has got from the audience across the globe. We are looking forward for the film to release in other untapped territories to reach more audience," the spokesperson went on to add.Reports were also doing the rounds that the Nitesh Tiwari film has become the fifth highest-grossing non-English film in cinematic history.Dangal revolves around wrestler Mahavir Singh Phogat, played by Aamir Khan, and his journey to train his daughters Geeta Phogat and Babita Kumari to become world-class wrestling champions.
