Those who dream to become PM never get the post: Fadnavis.
Mumbai, Dec 26 (PTI) Taking a dig at NCP president Sharad Pawar, Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis today said those who harbour ambitions to become prime minister never get the top job. "The aspirations of those who wish to be the prime minister are never fulfilled. Take the case of Sharad Pawar and (Samajwadi Party supremo) Mulayam Singh Yadav. (So) let me remain chief minister," Fadnavis said during an interaction with IIT-Bombay students here. He was answering a question from a student whether he wanted to become the prime minister. "Had...insightful interaction with the young, bright minds and Arnab Goswami at IIT Bombays Mood Indigo (festival)," Fadnavis tweeted later. As suggested by one of the students, "we would be pleased to recruit IITians to work for the government," he said. Demonetisation is one of the major steps to end corruption. First result of this process was money got deposited in banks, making it traceable, he said.
