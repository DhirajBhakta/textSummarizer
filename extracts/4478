10,000 engineering colleges to get online complaint system.
New Delhi, Feb 26 (PTI) Soon, the students and the faculty members of around 10,000 engineering colleges in the country will be able to register their complaints and grievances online. The All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE), which regulates technical education in the country, has asked all the institutions, affiliated to it, "to urgently put in place an online mechanism, if not presently existing, for registering and disposing of grievances". According to a latest AICTE directive, the HRD Ministry has stressed the need to have a mechanism for online registration as well as disposal of the grievances not only of the students but also the faculty members and the other stakeholders. The effectiveness of the online grievance redressal system will be a factor at the time of granting of the annual approval to an institution by the AICTE. "Every institution should be able to receive and dispose off the grievances online," said the missive, signed by AICTE chief Anil Sahasrabudhe and addressed to the heads of all the AICTE-approved technical institutions. As per directive, each of these institutions will have to put up a notice board or flex board fixed near the office of the Head, giving details of the online grievance redressal mechanism like its URL, names, contact numbers and e-mail addresses of members of the Grievance committee etc.
