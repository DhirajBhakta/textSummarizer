Aamir Khan earns 175 crore from 'Dangal': Reports.
Aamir Khan possesses a Midas touch. All his films are almost guaranteed to strike box-office gold, and his last release, Dangal, was no different. Dangal broke all records to become the highest grossing Bollywood film ever, and if a report DNA is to be believed, the actor received a handsome return.An industry insider is quoted as saying, "Aamir himself has earned a humongous Rs 175 crore (approx) from the film with the kind of profit-sharing partnership he entered into with co-producers Disney UTV. While he took Rs 35 crore upfront he also took 33 per cent of partnership as he always does for his films. And will take 33 per cent royalty in whatever money the film earns in the future, including satellite rights."With that whopping sum as his fee, Aamir is probably the highest paid actor in B-Town right now.
