Guards open both doors of car, user tweets 'NO Mrs Modi'.
The much anticipated PM Narendra Modi - President Donald Trump meet is now over. Modi, the first leader to be invited to the White House, had a one-on-one interaction with US President Donald Trump, and held a joint conference for the media post their interaction. PM Modi then proceeded to a cocktail reception and a working dinner with the First Family of the United States.  A red carpet welcome awaited PM Modi on Monday, with President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump waiting to greet him at the White House. Marine Sentries at the White House were waiting to do their ceremonial duty of opening the car doors for PM Modi. But one of the sentries had some awkward moments as Narendra Modi's car arrived.WATCH THIS VIDEO US President @realDonaldTrump welcomes PM @narendramodi on his arrival at @WhiteHouse in Washington D.C.https://t.co/JYmHbWQhywpic.twitter.com/eN8Yb3fjg1Two Marine corps, standing on either sides of the car PM Modi was in, could be seen saluting as the car arrives. Both of them take two steps towards the car, holds the door, say something to each other (possibly, "at the count of three"), and tries to open the door. PM Modi was seated on the right side. Usually, the leader's wife sits on the adjacent seat, and the guards open the door for her too. Was the White House ignorant of the fact that PM Modi's wife doesn't live, travel with him Or do they open the left door anyway Not just that, the guard on the left side of the car could be seen struggling to open the door he was supposed to. He manages to, eventually, and holds the door open for no one in particular. It could be a code there. Twitter user @GabbbarSingh was quick to notice this. He tweeted... 1 Modi's car arrives2.
