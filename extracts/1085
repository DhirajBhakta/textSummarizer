Girls to get lessons on menstruation at Delhi govt schools.
New Delhi, Feb 19 (PTI) FAQs about menstruation will now be answered at Delhi government schools with an NGO conducting "period talks" for teenage girls. In a campaign named "Break the Bloody taboo", NGO Sacchi Saheli which started with imparting these lessons in slums will now conduct sessions in 70 government-run schools. "Usually lessons on menstruation are imparted to girls by their mothers who unfortunately also pass on superstition, stigma and fear surrounding the natural bodily process. "There is an urgent need to educate young girls that menstruation is no disease and they need not be ashamed of it," said Surbhi Singh, a gynaecologist, who has been roped into conduct these lessons. The teams aim is to offer scientific reasons for basic questions such as whether its advisable to take painkillers for cramps, and also dispelling myths of women being told not to touch pickle or wash their hair during periods. During the session, a questionnaire will be handed out to girls to gauge how much they know about the process.
