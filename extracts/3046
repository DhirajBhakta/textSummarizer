Gujarat BJP ministers spark row for meeting 100 exorcists.
Two Gujarat ministers courted controversy this weekend after they were spotted at an event meant to felicitate exorcists in Botad district's Gadhada village. According to a report by Tv9 Gujarati, Education and Revenue Minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama and Social Justice and Empowerment Minister Atmaram Parmar were sitting on the dais of the event that also saw two exorcists beat themselves with metal chains to Gujarati music.The ministers triggered controversy after a video clip of them at the event went viral. Chudasama, however, defended his presence, saying it was just a gathering of 'worshippers of the divine'. According to news agency PTI, the event was organised by a local unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party and also saw participation from the area's MLA. PTI also reported that the the two ministers were seen shaking hands with around 100 exorcists who were present at the felicitation ceremony. Jayant Pandya, a prominent rationalist and the chief of the NGO Bharat Jan Vigyan Jatha, sharply criticised the two ministers, calling their presence at the event shameful. Speaking to Tv9 Gujarati, Padnya said his organisation condemns the episode and added that this was the first time he saw high-ranking government functionaries attending such an event.'(My NGO) has decided to write to Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani and urge him to ensure that cabinet ministers do not attend such events and promote (superstitious) practices,' Pandya told the Gujarati TV channel. Unfazed by the criticism, Education Minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama defended his and his colleague's presence at the exorcists' event. PTI quoted Chudasama as saying, "I attended the programme because it was a gathering of worshippers of divine power, not those who spread superstition."
