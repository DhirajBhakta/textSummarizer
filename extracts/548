Advice youngsters to focus on talent over 6-pack abs: Mithun.
National award winning actor Mithun Chakraborty has acted in many acclaimed Hindi, Bengali, Oriya and Telugu films, and if there is one piece of advice that he would like to give the younger crop of actors, it would be  to focus on talent and not just looks.?If you have talent then you have the capability to crack it in the film industry. You can be in mainstream or regional  film industry but if you are not persistent with your efforts and talent then you cannot do anything. The only advice I have for youngsters is that concentrate more on your talent than six pack abs,? says Chakraborty, who has been part of films such a Shaukeen (1982), Swami Dada (1982) and Disco Dancer (1982).The 67-year-old actor is back on the small screen as part of the comedy show, The Drama Company, in which he is working with big television comedians  such as Krushna Abhishek, Ali Asgar and Sugandha Mishra. Talking about his return, the actor says, ?I have been working for almost 300 days out of 365 days in a year and suddenly because of back pain I was bedridden. I have not seen the face of the camera for almost two years. I feel good getting back in action. Television has become huge today and it is good to be part of such a show, which brings something new to people.?The actor adds, ? I am  nervous because all of them are already very established actors on television and I don?t know how I will be able to perform with them on the platform.? Follow @htshowbiz for more
