Kerala Youth Congress workers suspended for killing cow.
Hours after party vice-president Rahul Gandhi strongly condemned party's youth unit workers slaughtering a cow in Kannur, Kerala, the Congress today suspended workers who organised the protest event. "Such elements have no place in Congress. Youth Congress workers have been suspended," Congress leader Randeep Surjewala said. Rahul Gandhi had strongly condemned his party workers slaughtering a cow in public to protest against Centre's ban on purchase of cattle from animal markets for slaughter. The meat was then distributed to onlookers."What happened in Kerala yesterday is thoughtless, barbaric and completely unacceptable to me and the Congress Party. I strongly condemn the incident," Rahul Gandhi said in a tweet.Kerala Police had booked some Youth Congress activists after the incident drew flak from various quarters.
