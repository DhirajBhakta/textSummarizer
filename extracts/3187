Clash bound to happen: Akshay on same day release with SRK.
Box-office clashes have become inevitable in the recent past. From Dilwale and Bajirao Mastani to Ae Dil Hai Mushkil and Shivaay to Raees and Kaabil, Bollywood saw some of the biggest films take on each other at the ticket windows recently. And now fans are gearing up for another big clash. This time Akshay Kumar's Toilet Ek Prem Katha will fight it out with Shah Rukh Khan's next with Imtiaz Ali at the box office. And this has raised expectations and tension. But Khiladi Kumar, who has been in the industry for over two decades now, is unfazed by the clash. In an interview to BollywoodLife.com, Akshay said, "Tell me a guy who doesn't have a clash Clash is going to happen. There are 180 films that release every year and how many weeks are there Nearly 52. Clash is bound to happen."  This is not the first time that Akshay's film is facing competition at the box office. Last year, Rustom clashed with Hrithik Roshan's Mohenjo Daro, and passed the test with flying colours. The 49-year-old actor is expecting the same from Toilet Ek Prem Katha. From a quirky title to an interesting storyline to a fantastic on-screen pairing, the film has already raised expectations. The film stars Bhumi Pednekar alongside Akshay and is set to hit the screens on August 11 this year.
