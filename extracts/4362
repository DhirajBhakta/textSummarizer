House of Cards maker asks Twitter to remove Trump's account.
Los Angeles, Mar 5 (PTI) "House of Cards" creator Beau Willimon wants Twitter to delete Donald Trumps account and even shared a 16-point argument as to why the President "should be removed" from the micro-blogging website. Trump, in a series of tweets, accused his predecessor Barack Obama of "wire tapping" his office in New York just before the 2016 presidential elections and likened the alleged surveillance of his communications to the "Watergate" scandal. Referring to Trumps posts, Willimon, 39, wrote, "Todays tantrum is just the latest example of why @realDonaldTrump and @POTUS must be removed from @Twitter." Adding that being the President of the United States comes with "a supreme and unique responsibility unlike any other user" Willimon wrote that Trumps tweets have a "real and significant impact on the business of governance, world affairs and national security." "President Trump has consistently made misleading claims, attacked the judiciary and threatened sovereign states, the press and public," he continued. He further said how todays outburst "is broadcasting to foreign leaders his continuing impulsiveness, recklessness, delusion and ignorance about government." Adding, "That makes Trumps tweets a national security threat. It emboldens our enemies to take advantage of his flagrant shortcomings." He also pointed out that if people argue that removing his account is "violation of free speech" then consider how "the White House has retaliated against the press by selectively locking them out, called them the enemy of the people and ignored hard questions."
