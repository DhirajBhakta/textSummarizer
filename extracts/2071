Indian defence forces to be under US scrutiny, claims CPI(M).
New Delhi, Dec 13 (PTI) Indian defence forces and defence production would be "open to scrutiny" and "control" by the United States which will make India its "junior ally" following finalisation of the Major Defense Partner designation, CPI(M) has alleged. Noting that the US has placed the details of Major Defense Partner designation for Senate approval as part of FY 2017 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), the party said the Narendra Modi government "has not even made a statement in Parliament about such a significant deal." "The country can see the US side of the deal by reading the 2017 NDAA, but remains ignorant of the Indian commitment as a Major Defense Partner of the United States," CPI(M) General Secretary Sitaram Yechury said. In a letter to the Prime Minister, he referred to Paragraph (E) of Section 1292 of 2017 NDAA, "which talks of mechanisms to verify the security of defense articles, defense services, and related technology, such as appropriate cyber security and end user monitoring agreements for items and technologies sold to India. "Paragraph (F) thereafter states that India will align its export control and procurement regimes with those of the United States." Yechury further said, "Paragraph(I) of Section 1292, 2017 NDAA makes the facts amply clear. It explicitly highlights enhanced defense and security cooperation with India in order to advance United States interests in South Asia and greater Indo-Asia-Pacific regions." "This is, sadly, a commitment by your government to become a junior ally of the US in our own neighbourhood. This represents the final nail in the coffin of Indias independent foreign policy," Yechury said in his letter to Modi.
