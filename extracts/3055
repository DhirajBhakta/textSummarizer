80-yr-old woman beaten by MP cops for 'sheltering agitators'.
An 80-year-old woman in Bhopal has alleged that a group of four-five policemen barged into her house and beat her with sticks, breaking her bones and grievously injuring her husband too. According to an NDTV report, the policemen came to her house while chasing agitators who had disrupted a rally in nearby Phanda Kalan village near Sehore, as they ran through her compound. When the boys outran the cops, they turned to Kamlabai (80) and said, "You are one of them, you ordered that trucks be set ablaze." After beating Kamlabai, her husband and sons, the cops arrested her grandsons along with Kamlabai herself. Bandaged on arms and legs where she has suffered fractures, Kamlabai went to meet the Madhya Pradesh CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan who was fasting 40km from her village in Dusshera Maidan in Bhopal. But to her dismay, she was not allowed to meet the chief minister who was holding his 'peace fast' for the state farmers. The couple has gone on a fast now, demanding that the chief minister meet them and assure them justice for the unprovoked assault they were subjected to and punish the policemen.
