BSF seizes fake ?2k notes worth ?2 lakh from Malda.
The Border Security Force (BSF) has seized fake Indian currency notes (FICN) worth 2 lakh rupees from West Bengal's Malda district after it thwarted a bid to smuggle fake currency into from across Bangladesh. This recovery by the BSF, from the porous Indo-Bangladesh border, comes as a huge setback for the central government, which has been claiming that its demonetising 500 and 1000 rupee notes put a full stop on terror financing and smuggling of fake currency. On February 14, the BSF in a joint operation with NIA, arrested a fake currency racketeer called Umar Faruq alias Firoz from Churiantpur border outpost in Gopalganj area of Malda. The police, while interrogating him, learnt about the delivery of an FICN consignment from Bangladesh scheduled for later last night. Â Â
