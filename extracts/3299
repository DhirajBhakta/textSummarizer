Declare Hurriyat a terror group, says General VK Singh.
In an extremely hard hitting interview to India Today, Union Minister of State for External Affairs, General VK Singh has demanded that the Hurriyat Conference be declared a terrorist organisation and separatist leaders like Naeem Khan and Bitta Karate be immediately jailed under the Public Safety Act of Jammu and Kashmir. WATCH VIDEOGeneral Singh has also demanded that people like Syed Ali Shah Geelani should not be allowed to live in relative comfort while under house arrest.Instead, Singh wants that the Hurriyat leaders be locked up in central prisons on terrorism charges. He congratulated the India Today Group for Hurriyat Truth Tapes and described the special investigation as the most compelling evidence ever gathered against the 'terrorists' in the Hurriyat because the Hurriyat leaders have themselves admitted that they are paid by Pakistan to burn schools in Kashmir.General Singh said the onus is now on the Mehbooba Mufti government to commence immediate and unprecedented clampdown on the Hurriyat Conference leaders who only care about the well being of their own families and are nothing but stooges of Pakistan.India Today aired a special investigative report where Hurriyat's Provincial President (Geelani Faction) Naeem Khan was caught on camera admitting that Pakistan is funding violence in the Kashmir Valley.Several top Kashmiri separatists were also caught on camera confessing to receiving funds from across the border.Some of them also admitted they raised money domestically, pledging to repeat the deadly events of 2016 if financed again. The stunning probe that rips apart the devious designs of anti-India forces in Kashmir includes Hurriyat's Provincial President (Geelani Faction) Naeem Khan, Tehreek-E-Hurriyat's leader Gazi Javed Baba, and JKLF chairman Farooq Ahmed Dar (Bitta Karate).The investigation traces the terror funding trail. Hurriyat leader Naeem Khan stealthily travels down to Delhi to meet India Today reporters, who posed as potential funders.The investigation revealed that Pakistan's agents who are trying to destabilise Kashmir through street violence are hidden in Delhi.The expose was hailed not only by the government and the BJP but also by the Congress.Also read:India Today impact: NIA roped in to probe Pakistan link in Hurriyat tapes, says Kashmir minister Hurriyat hypocrisy: How children of separatist leaders lead a life of luxury
