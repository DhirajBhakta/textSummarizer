Twitter erupts with jokes, memes after Trump-Pope first meet.
When you are a world leader, and that too, the President of United States of America, avoiding being photographed is not an option. POTUS was recently in Rome to meet Pope Francis, someone who has criticised him in the past. Trump and Pope Francis had a history of public feuds which clearly reflected during their much awkward meeting at the Vatican.There was one particular photograph that went viral and triggered a Photoshop war on social media platforms.  This photo.Scary, eh?
