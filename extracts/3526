Rana Daggubati shares details about prank on co-star Prabhas.
Rana Daggubati and Prabhas play arch-enemies Bhallala Deva and Baahubali on screen. While Prabhas is Baahubali, a man who is kind, benevolent, noble and brave, Rana Daggubati is Bhallala Deva, a conniving, bitter, arrogant and evil person. Prabhas and Rana's on-screen characters could not be more different from each other. But in real life, these two are the best of friends.Prabhas and Rana Daggubati shot for Baahubali: The Beginning and Baahubali: The Conclusion for up to five years. During this time, the two developed a unique, warm camaraderie that will go beyond the Baahubali films. And as it goes with close friends, these two played pranks on each other.Rana Daggubati in a recent episode of the chat show Konchem Touch lo Unte Chepta spilled out the beans about one such prank. Turns out, Rana made a prank call to Prabhas and said that he wanted help because the police has caught him!Prabhas patiently listened to Rana and then said, "Tell the police that you are in Baahubali 2 as my companion and they will leave you."Seems like either Prabhas was way too much in character to speak as boldly as Baahubali does in the films. Or he saw through Rana Daggubati's prank.Meanwhile, Baahubali 2: The Conclusion is breaking all kinds of Indian box-office records. The film has already made up to Rs 450 crore worldwide and its Hindi version has earned the maximum amount of money among all Bollywood films in the first weekend.The BIGGIES and their first 3 days...#Sultan โน 105.53 cr [Wednesday release]#Dangal โน 107.01 cr#Baahubali2 โน 128 cr [Hindi]India bizStarring Prabhas, Rana Daggubati, Anushka Shetty, Sathyaraj, Tamannaah and Ramya Krishnan, Baahubali 2: The Conclusion, directed by SS Rajamouli, is presently running in theatres.OPINION: Is Prabhas India's next big superstar
