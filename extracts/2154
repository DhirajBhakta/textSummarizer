TIME magazine list is a joke: Donald Trump had said in 2013.
US President-elect Donald Trump is an elated soul as success and fame is coming rapidly his way. After winning the US presidency last month in a stunning upheaval, he has now been elected as the 2016 TIME Person of the Year (POY), a recognition that is considered a global benchmark.Trump expressed his happiness calling his POY title a 'great honour' which means a 'lot to him'. According to NBC New York, Trump said, "It's a great honour, it means a lot. Especially me growing up, reading TIME magazine, it's a very important magazine. I've been lucky enough to be on the cover many times this year and last year."When the TIME 2016 POY shortlist was announced on NBC's Today show, Donald Trump was among the 11 candidates including India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi who won the TIME Person of the Year Popular Vote second year in a row.But when we look at Donald Trump's vitriolic views on the TIME magazine in past, this sudden change of heart looks as shocking as his victory in the presidential polls. If we see those comments, Trump's reaction today sounds like a plain lie.
