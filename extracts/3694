MCD polls litmus test for Ajay Maken: Sheila Dikshit.
New Delhi, Apr 21 (PTI) Former chief minister Sheila Dikshit today said the MCD polls are a litmus test for the Congresss Delhi unit chief Ajay Maken and hit out at Arvinder Singh Lovely, who quit the party to join the BJP, terming him an "opportunist". She said that if Congress manages to win a "good number" of seats in the municipal corporation elections, then Maken will prove his detractors in Delhi Congress wrong. "Let us wait for the election results when we will be really able to judge whether our impression is correct or incorrect. If Congress wins a good number of seats then what we are thinking would be proved wrong," she said when asked about questions on Makens style of functioning. Dikshits name was not included in the list of partys top campaigners although Maken had claimed that he had a written to her for participating in the campaigning for party candidates.
