Madras HC judge raises doubts over Jayalalithaa's death.
The Madras High Court today expressed its doubts over the December 5 demise of J Jayalalithaa, saying the death was sudden and there was no medical report submitted of her long illness."Media has raised a lot of doubts. Personally I also have doubts in Jayalalithaa's death," Justice Vaidyalingam of the Madras High Court said."When she was admitted in hospital, it was said that she was on proper diet. At least after her death now, truth should be revealed," he said. The next hearing into the case is scheduled for January 9.
