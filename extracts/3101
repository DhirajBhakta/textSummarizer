Goat chews up owner's ?66,000, he says 'it's like my child'.
What do goats prefer to have when they are really hungry? Well, this one apparently likes its food in 'pink' rather than 'green'.A 'hungry' goat chewed Rs 66,000 that its owner had kept in the pocket of his trouser in Siluapur village in Kannauj district of Uttar Pradesh. According to a Times of India report , farmer Sarvesh Kumar Patel had kept some Rs 66,000, all new pink Rs 2000 notes, in his trousers. The trouser was kept close to where one of his goats was tied. When Sarvesh returned after a few minutes, he saw his  goat munching something. To his shock it was his currency notes that the goat was chewing.  Sarvesh took evasive action to save his money that he had kept to buy bricks for his under-construction house. But he could only manage to retrieve two Rs 2000 notes. The rest were gone."I was taking a bath and the money was kept in the pocket of my trousers. Notorious for eating all kinds of paper products, the goat seized the chance to munch on its favourite food. What to do, my goat is like a child to me," The Times of India quoted Sarvesh, as saying. As the news spread, neighbours and people from nearby villages visited Sarvesh's house to meet the note-munching goat. The farmer said people gave him numerous solutions to recover the notes. Some even advised Sarvesh to sell it to a butcher. Some were of the view that the goat should be handed over to the police. Luckily, Sarvesh snubbed at all the suggestions and the goat continues to nibble at the master's house.ALSO READ:
