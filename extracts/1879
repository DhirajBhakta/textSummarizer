Tomb discovered behind 4,200-year-old wall in Egypt.
Cairo, Dec 26 (PTI) In a "stunning" discovery, archaeologists have found compelling evidence of new pharaonic tombs behind a 4,200-year-old wall unearthed in Egypt. The two-metre high ancient encroachment wall has been found below a visitors pathway in the West Aswan cemetery at Qubbet el-Hawa, Egypts Ministry of Antiquities said. The wall is thought to indicate the architectural support for the known tombs of the first upper terrace, including those of Harkhuf and Heqaib, who were governors of Elephantine Island during the Old Kingdom. Owing to the landscape of Qubbet el-Hawa, the support wall helped to secure the hillside, and thus lower lying tombs, which were accessible by a causeway leading to a second terrace, according to the archaeological mission directed by Dr Martin Bommas of the University of Birmingham in the UK. "The findings are dramatically altering our understanding of the funerary landscape in this area during the Old Kingdom and First Intermediate Period in 2278-2184 BC," Carl Graves, a PhD student who worked alongside Bommas on the project, said. "I dont think anyone yet knows who the tombs might have belonged to," Graves said.
