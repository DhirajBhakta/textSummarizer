Indrani forged Peters signature on bank documents: Reports.
A special CBI court on Wednesday asked banks to verify signatures and not act on any letters sent by Indrani Mukherjea, accused in Sheena Bora murder case. Indrani, who is currently serving jail term in Mumbai's Byculla Jail, is alleged to have forged husband Peter Mukherjea's signature and addressed letters to two banks to grab joint accounts and fixed deposits. She had addressed the letters to Syndicate Bank, Worli and a bank in New Zealand.
