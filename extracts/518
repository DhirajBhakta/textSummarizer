Vatican turns off fountains for 1st time in yrs amid drought.
Vatican authorities have turned off 100 fountains, including two Baroque masterpieces in St. Peters Square, due to a prolonged drought affecting the tiny city state and the city of Rome, which surrounds it. Suffocating summer heat has followed two years of lower-than-average rainfall in Rome, forcing the Italian capital to close drinking fountains and consider the prospect of water rationing.More than a million residents of Rome are facing water rationing for up to eight hours a day as the prolonged heatwave that has ravaged southern Europe takes its toll. Vatican spokesman Greg Burke said it was the first time authorities in the spiritual home of the worlds 1.2 billion Catholics could remember being forced to turn off the fountains. Standing in St Peters Square, where two fountains by 17th-century sculptors Carlo Maderno and Gian Lorenzo Bernini stood dry, Burke said the Vatican wanted to help. This is the Vaticans way of living in solidarity with Rome, trying to help Rome get through this crisis, he told Reuters TV.The measure was initiated on Monday, and all 100 Vatican fountains will be turned off gradually over the coming days. Rome is gasping after 72% less rain than normal fell in July, according to Sky Italias weather TV channel. There was 74% less than normal in June, and a 56% reduction from the long-term average across March, April and May. Caring for the planet and its resources is an important issue for Pope Francis, who demanded swift action by world leaders in the first ever papal document dedicated to the environment. This decision is very much in line with the popes thinking on ecology: you cant waste and sometimes you have to be willing to make a sacrifice, Burke said.
