Rabbit set to be world's biggest dies on United flight.
London, Apr 26 (PTI) A giant rabbit, destined to be the worlds biggest bunny, died mysteriously on a United Airlines flight to the US, the latest in a slew of public relations nightmares faced by the beleaguered American airline recently. Three-foot Simon died in the cargo section of a Boeing 767 after flying out of Heathrow to a new celebrity owner in the US, The Sun reported. Simon was expected to outgrow his father Darius, whose length of 4ft 4 inches made him the worlds biggest bunny. "He was as fit as a fiddle. Ive sent rabbits around the world before and nothing like this happened," Simons breeder Annette Edwards was quoted as saying. Edwards said Simon was healthy when placed in the cargo hold. But Simon was found dead after the Boeing 767-300 landed at Chicagos OHare International Airport. "Something very strange has happened and I want to know what. Ive sent rabbits all around the world and nothing like this has happened before," Edwards said. "The client who bought Simon is very famous. Hes upset," she said. Simon, a continental giant rabbit, was 10-months-old. Continental giants cost 5,000 pounds a year to keep. Edwards rabbits are hired out at 500 pounds a time. United Airlines said, "We are reviewing this matter". An airport source was quoted as saying that the news of Simons demise sparked panic among United Airlines staff. "After the viral video, no-one wanted responsibility for killing what was to be the worlds biggest rabbit," the source said, referring to the controversy United Airlines was embroiled in after a passenger was forcibly removed from plane earlier this month.
