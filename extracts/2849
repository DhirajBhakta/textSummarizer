By the time it reached Okhla, the compartment was full. About 20-25 persons boarded the train from Okhla. My brother Junaid was asked by an aged man who boarded the train to give seat to him. He got up and gave the seat to him," he said."All of a sudden the group of 20-25 persons who had boarded the train from Okhla station pushed us and my brother Junaid fell down. When I and Junaid told them why they were pushing they pointed to a skull cap on my head. They told us that we are Muslims, anti-nationals, Pakistani, ate beef and then while hurling abuses at us they pulled my cap and threw it down. They also tried to pull my beard," Hashim said recounting the harrowing experience.Hashim said that later the group started beating him and his brothers in the train.ALSO READ:Man lynched, 3 thrashed over rumours of beef eating on Delhi-Ballabhgarh train route
