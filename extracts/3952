Faced casting couch only in Malayalam industry: Parvathy.
If you say you aren't smitten by Parvathy, you're probably lying. We love the actor for several reasons, be it her infectious smile or the characters she choose to play in films.  However, the actor recently opened up on casting couch saying that it's not a myth, at least in Malayalam industry.Parvathy was quoted by The News Minute as saying, "Of course there is casting couch in the Malayalam film industry. You know it, I know it, I'm sure a lot of people know it. I don't understand why it's a surprise at all. It's a reality, why are we even shocked about it? I haven't faced it at all in any other industry, but only in Malayalam industry."Parvathy has often been referred as Lady Prithviraj. Responding to the tag, she said, "It's supposed to be a compliment, right? Prithviraj speaks his mind, so do I. I hope he doesn't get insulted with people calling me that. He is one person who is thoroughly interested in a film's technical aspects and can go on at length about them. But I am not like that."Basking in the success of Take Off, Parvathy is once again teaming up with Prithviraj for a romantic film My Story, which is being directed by Rishini Dinakar.
