DDA clears plan to revamp Delhi's Basant Lok complex.
The Basant Lok complex, popularly known as Priyas, was once a favourite hangout spot in South Delhi. But with fast depleting infrastructure and civic amenities, the area was losing competition to nearby malls.The Delhi Development Authority will spend Rs 10 crore to revamp the complex with spacious lanes, an amphitheatre, extra parking, an open plaza, more toilets, rainwater harvesting system and sewage treatment plant facility.The plan has been approved by lieutenant governor Anil Baijal and the work will start in the next three months, said a DDA official. An survey of the area showed lack of fire safety arrangements, broken walkways and choked drains, he said. We will not just upgrade buildings but electrical and fire fighting mechanisms too, he said. The corridors will be paved in granite, disabled friendly infrastructure and CCTVs for security. The area will be declared one-way for traffic on the road in front of the market complex. Basant Lok was built in the 1970s and till the early 2000s was one of the most prominent markets of Delhi. Even big international brands opened their flagship stores at the market. But in past one decade poor maintenance had led to market associations complaining about loss of business.Street furniture, plantation and lighting arrangements will be made in the complex to give it a distinct look, the official said.
