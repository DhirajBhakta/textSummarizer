Vogue 125th anniversary cover slammed for lack of diversity.
One wouldn't have thought that a plus-size model could feature in advertisements, let alone the cover page of leading fashion magazines, even a decade back. But that's just the kind of progress we have made over time. Fashion, today, is about celebrating all body types with utter confidence and oomph. So it doesn't come as a surprise that plus-size supermodel Ashley Graham would feature in the upcoming edition of Vogue. The March 2017 issue of the magazine is celebrating beauty in all its forms.

Fashion's Fearless Female', the issue features Ashley Graham, Gigi Hadid, Kendall Jenner, Adwoa Aboah, Liu Wen, Vittoria Ceretti, and Imaan Hammam--all of them in black turtleneck tops, and multi-coloured, high-waist beach shorts. Vogue claims that this issue is revolutionary, and as their cover announces, 'No norm is the new norm'.
