Republican Party of India to seek ?636-cr loan waiver for SCs.
The Republican Party of India (RPI) led by union minister Ramdas Athawale would start an agitation from July 25, demanding a loan waiver of Rs636 crore, which had been advanced by  state-run corporations to people from Scheduled Class and Tribes for self-employment and other reasons.According to a source, RPI party workers will agitate across the state in front of collectors? offices demanding the waiver. According to Athawale, like farmers, even  people from socially backward classes are facing hardships. ?These people are in no position to pay and hence the loans should be waived off. If the farmers can get relief, even these people who have taken loans should be let off,? said Athawale. He said he would talk to chief minister Devendra Fadnavis on this issue. Various state-run corporations like Annabhau Sathe Mahamandal and Mahatma Phule backward Class Development Corporation provide loans to the people belonging to the backward classes and tribes to start their own ventures at subsidised interest rates. However, the number of defaulters seem to be on the rise. Last month, farmers across the state started their strike, which resulted in a massive shortage of vegetable and fruits as well as rates reaching record highs. This forced Fadnavis to accept their demands and he announced a mega loan waiver of Rs34,000 crore. Political analysts called such demands as just vote-gathering tactics. ?The Fadnavis Government has opened a Pandoras box and now many disadvantageous sections will demand similar concessions,? said political analyst Prakash Bal. ?Athawale is just playing to the gallery as these people are his voters, but the Government is unlikely to cede to his demand,? he added.
