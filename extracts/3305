Japanese tennis player gets life ban for match fixing.
Japanese tennis player Junn Mitsuhashi has been banned for life and fined 50,000 US dollars after being found guilty of match-fixing and betting offences, the Tennis Integrity Unit (TIU) said on Tuesday.Mitsuhashi, who peaked at 295 in the singles rankings in 2009, was accused of asking Joshua Chetty, a player he had coached, to approach a competitor during an International Tennis Federation (ITF) event in South Africa in November 2015.Using Chetty as an intermediary, Mitsuhashi offered the player 2,000 US dollars to underperform in a singles match and 600 US dollars in a doubles match, the TIU said.The player rejected the offer and reported the approach to the TIU. Under the Tennis Anti-Corruption Program, money or other benefit does not have to change hands to constitute a serious corruption offence, the TIU told Reuters in an email.Chetty was banned for life last September following a separate TIU investigation.
