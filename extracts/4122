I wish Kangana gets along with co-stars in future: Shahid.
Shahid Kapoor and Kangana Ranaut's cold war has crossed all possible contours of normalcy and has probably crossed over to the bizarre now. The film that Shahid and Kangana starred in and which was the beginning of all the drama, Rangoon, has sunk into oblivion. But trust the actors to not let sleeping dogs lie.After repeated jibes from Kangana regarding his 'mood swings' and behaviour on the sets of Rangoon, now Shahid Kapoor has spoken out about it all.In an interview with Filmfare, when Shahid was asked about Kangana saying that it was difficult to kiss him with his thick moustache in Rangoon, the Kaminey actor said, "Kangana has a thing for one-liners. I'm not one of those. I'd rather focus on the movie. I like positivity. We shared a professional equation. So, I was also surprised by the comments. I also read some retractions she made later that she didn't mean it in a bad way."During the promotions of Rangoon, when IndiaToday.in asked Shahid about any 'incidents' during the shoot of the Vishal Bhardwaj-directed film, Shahid had denied it all with a curt, "No, no incidents on this movie."However, Kangana Ranaut would beg to differ. From talking about how on certain days Shahid would treat her like she was a 'suicide bomber' to his severe mood swings, Kangana bared it all to filmmaker and talk-show host Karan Johar on KJo's show.Shahid went on to tell the magazine, "When actors start engaging in this table-tennis match through interviews, which the media feeds off, the focus is then on the actors and not the film. I don't believe in publicising a film or myself through this kind of activity."The fights sure made Rangoon more the talking point than what it normally would have been.
