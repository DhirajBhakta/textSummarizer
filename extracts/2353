Ex-women's champ makes male fan play tennis wearing a skirt.
?That?s a man, in skirt, trying to return a Kim Clijsters? serve.?Yes, you read that right.During the ladies? invitational match in the ongoing Wimbledon 2017, the commentator was heard saying these lines as everyone present at the court ? from the four-time champion to those playing in the match as well as the viewers ? were left in splits at the sight of a burly man in a skirt and a white t-shirt.pic.twitter.com/2wmWfgnAf1? Kim Clijsters (@Clijsterskim) July 14, 2017When it was her turn to serve, Kim asked the audience what kind of serve she should make ? wide or down the middle. The man, sitting close to the court, was loud enough to be heard when he shouted ?a body serve?.Clijsters checked with him whether he had actually said that, and once convinced, she invited him to the court which he duly accepted. As the man came on to the court and Clijsters prepared to serve, she stopped and ran towards one of the kit bags. The four-time grand slam champion took out a white skirt and asked the fan to put it on. But there was one problem: obviously, it was too short for the burly man.Clijsters was in splits as he struggled his way through it putting the skirt on. She was on the floor.When he was ready ? the person also pulled on a white t-shirt ? he also managed to return a Kim Clijsters? serve. Surely, it would remain one of the best days in that fan?s life, as he also posed for a picture with the tennis legend.
