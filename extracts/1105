Only Cong will benefit from alliance with SP in UP: Mulayam.
In an exclusive interview with India Today, Samajwadi Party patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav today said that it is the Congress that stands to benefit from the alliance for Uttar Pradesh Assembly election, not his party."Congress had no footing in Uttar Pradesh. This alliance has revived their chances to win some seats. The contest was otherwise between the Samajwadi Party and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)", he said.Talking about the 2012 Assembly elections, Mulayam reassuringly said that he did not regret making Akhilesh the chief minister. But added, "I made Akhilesh the chief minister because I knew if I did not, he would never become the CM."Refuting rumours of an ongoing turmoil in the family and the party, he said that those who did not get the ticket were still angry, but there was no rift in the party as such.Also read: Uttar Pradesh: Polarisation could scupper Rahul-Akhilesh alliance in assembly elections Also read: Uttar Pradesh polls: Akhilesh Yadav promises 1 lakh jobs in police force without interview On being asked to rate Akhilesh Yadav and his governance on a scale of 1 to 10, he scoffed, "Why are you bringing him up again and again Ask the people to rate him.
