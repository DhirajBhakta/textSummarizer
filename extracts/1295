World's oldest emoji discovered in document from 1635.
Scientists have found what they believe is the world's oldest emoji - a smiley face scrawled in a legal document dating back to 1635.A lawyer reviewing municipal account documents in a village next to the Strazov Mountains of Slovakia, signed his go-ahead by drawing a small circle with two dots and a line - an image recognised today as a smiley-face emoji.The discovery makes it the world's oldest known emoji."I do not know if its the oldest Slovakian smiley or the world's oldest. But it is certainly one of the oldest in the Trencin region," said Peter Brindza, head of the National Archives in Slovakia.
