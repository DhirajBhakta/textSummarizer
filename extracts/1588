David Guetta's Mumbai show rescheduled to Jan 15: Organisers.
In the latest twist to David Guetta's controversial three-city India tour, event organizers announced that the the French DJ's Mumbai concert, initially cancelled, has now been rescheduled to January 15. Reports earlier emerged that the Mumbai event, scheduled for January had been cancelled after authorities failed to give the go-ahead for the show. In a statement issued late Friday night, Percept, the event's organizer, said that the concert has been rescheduled for January 15. Guetta is set to perform tonight in Hyderabad following which he will perform two shows on Sunday - the rescheduled Mumbai concert, which will take place in the morning, and another one in Delhi, which will be held as per schedule, beginning at 4pm. Reports of Guetta's Mumbai concert getting cancelled came right on the heels of the artist's Bengaluru show being scrapped. Controversy erupted after the organizers initially said that the reason for the cancellation was the law and order situation faced by the local police following incidents of alleged mass molestation on New Year's Eve. Bengaluru police fired back saying permission for the event had never been issued, adding that the organizers approached them for permission just two days before the concert date. Authorities added that they did not ask that the event be cancelled but only directed the organizers to reschedule it for a different date as the January 12 concert was clashing with local APMC polls.
