Yet another heart wrenching story of apathy has been reported in Karnataka. A young man was forced to carry his unconscious, and injured mother on foot  until help came by. He requested several people for help and even requested for an ambulance but did not get it in time.The incident took place at Udanoor cross in Kalburgi where Siddamma was walking with her son Ninganna. She had come to the city to meet her daughter. Siddama was rammed by a motorbike. Immediately after the accident, locals rushed to the spot and Ninganna found her mother lying in a pool of blood. She suffered head and leg injuries. Ninganna pleaded with several people around to help him take his mother to a hospital. But his pleading fell on deaf ears. For about 45 minutes he sought help, two policemen who were seated in a police van which was parked nearby also remained mute spectators.The locals tried calling an ambulance, but no ambulance turned up. Finally Ninganna decided to take his mother by foot towards the closest hospital.It is only after a crowd that had gathered there asked the police to help the young man, that they were transported to the nearest general hospital.Siddamma was given first aid by the government hospital and was later referred to a private hospital as they did not have facilities to treat her injuries. Unfortunately, Siddamma died on the way to the private hospital.  A bike and ambulance arrived at the spot an hour late. Locals said that had she got access to the ambulance on time she would have been alive.Also read:
