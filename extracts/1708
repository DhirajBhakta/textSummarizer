Kareena has told me to ensure Taimur plays cricket: Randhir.
It's been a little more than two weeks that Taimur Ali Khan Pataudi was born. Saif Ali Khan and Kareena Kapoor Khan's son had been hitting the headlines for almost nine months prior to that date. It felt as if the entire nation was looking forward to this baby.But sadly, when the baby was indeed born and news spread that he was named Taimur, Twitterati and social media began spewing venom and went as far as to pray for the baby to die because Taimur is a name shared by a 14th century conqueror who slaughtered millions of Indians centuries ago.ALSO WATCH: Saif-Kareena become proud parents to a baby boy, TaimurSpeaking on the mental trauma that the Kapoor-Khan family has had to face because of this, Kareena's father and Taimur's maternal grandfather Randhir Kapoor said that at the time of the controversy, he and Rishi Kapoor wondered if a person has the basic freedom to name his own son in such turbulent times?"I still cannot believe that just because a few people did not like a baby's name, they wanted the baby to die. I am sure that these people don't know that in Arabic, Taimur means iron," Randhir told Anandabazar Patrika.ALSO READ: These new photos of Saif-Kareena and Taimur are too good to miss
