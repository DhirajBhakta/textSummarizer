Odisha Home Guards asked to kneel as punishment.
However embarrassing and insulting it might be for them but it was a 'back to classroom days' moment for a group of four Home Guards in Odisha when they were asked to kneel down as a punishment.In a bizarre incident, the four Home Guards personnel, including a female cop, were asked to kneel down with their hands up as a punishment for wearing improper uniform in Odisha's Mayurbhanj district.Home Guards Reserve Inspector Ashok Kumar Sethi made the personnel kneel down for two minutes after finding them improperly dressed."My seniors often chided me after seeing Home Guards in civil clothes. To justify my work, I asked them to kneel down. My intent was not to embarrass them. I just wanted to be strict so that they realised the essence of discipline," Sethi said.The incident took place on June 26 when all the four Home Guards were on a special duty on the eve of Rath Yatra.
