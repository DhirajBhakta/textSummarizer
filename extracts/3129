Tubelight won't break records of Baahubali 2: Salman Khan.
Ever since the trailer of Salman Khan's Tubelight released, a lot has been said about how the film would probably break Baahubali 2's records at the box office. Many are of the opinion that Tubelight will be able to pull this off as Salman has a huge fan following. In fact, Salman's not-so-good friend Vivek Oberoi in a recent interview said that he wants Tubelight to break the records of Baahubali 2. He told IANS, "I want Tubelight to break records of Baahubali and become a superhit film. I feel Tubelight has all the capacity to make Hindi cinema proud all around the world and I would like to wish all the luck for the entire team of Tubelight."But Salman, who has collaborated with Kabir Khan for the third time, thinks otherwise. In an interview to Firstpost, the Bajrangi Bhaijaan actor said, "I doubt that Tubelight will break Baahubali 2's record, because the latter is one of the most freakish films that has been made. Hindi film-goers lapped up the film despite watching a dubbed version of it. It is because of the Hindi cine-goers that they have got these numbers."However, the actor added, "As long as nobody loses money, I am fine. I don't feel the pressure."Set against the backdrop of 1962 Sino-Indian war, Tubelight tells the story of two brothers. It is after a gap of seven years that Salman and brother Sohail Khan will share screen space. The film, which is set to hit the screens this Eid, also stars Chinese actor Zhu Zhu and late Om Puri.
