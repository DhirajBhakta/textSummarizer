Not letting Pak actors like Fawad work here a problem: Ratna.
Mumbai, Jul 5 (PTI) Ratna Pathak Shah, who has played mother to Fawad Khan in "Khoobsurat" and "Kapoor & Sons", says she would like to see more participation across nations in arts and working with Pakistani ators is not an "insurmountable problem". Fawad, already a big name in Pakistan, became a heartthrob in India after his debut with "Khoobsurat". However, the clamour against Pakistani artists just before the release of his film "Ae Dil Hai Mushkil" prompted him to leave the country, ending his Bollywood career. Asked if not letting Fawad Khan work in India was a problem, Ratna told PTI, "It is a problem but its not an insurmountable problem. Nobody is unhappy that these poor guys have been thrown out of the business. I dont know what that says about the people who went after Fawad and saw to it that hell never get to work again.
