EC must call all-party meet on EVMs tampering issue: Mamata.
In the wake of allegations of rigging of electronic voting machines (EVMs) in the recently concluded Uttar Pradesh assembly election, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has said that the Election Commission should convene an all-party meeting to discuss the matter."Whether one would accept or not is absolutely their choice. But the Election Commission may call an all-party meeting. Let the issue be discussed", Mamata said.When asked whether she was in favour of an investigation into the charges of tampering of EVMs, she said, "I have seen the Election Commissioner's version that there is nothing. But I have also gone through a video tape of BJP leader Subramanian Swamy in which he says these EVMs can be tampered with."Banerjee showed journalists footages of Swamy's video in which he talked about the possibility of voting machines being manipulated.SWAMY'S VIEW BASIS FOR MAMATA's DEMAND FOR PROBEIn the video clips, Swamy is seen saying that the EVMs were made in Japan, but ballot papers were used even there during elections because the machines could be rigged to favour a certain outcome.Even countries like the United States and Germany are using ballot papers instead of EVMs, the BJP leader was heard saying in the footage.Describing Swamy as "very strong legally", the Trinamool Congress supremo said, "What he (Swamy) has said is not wrong. He has not said anything bad. I have not said anything, but I think there can be an investigation into this issue."Incidentally, Mayawati had accused the BJP of murdering democracy following her party's drubbing in the Uttar Pradesh election, saying that the EVMs were tampered in such a way that only votes cast for the BJP were accepted. The Bahujan Samaj Party chief had even alleged that had it not been for the rigging of voting machines, BJP wouldn't have won from Muslim bastions in the state.Even Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has raised concerns of tampering of EVMs. Stating that the poll outcome in Punjab was completely unexpected for the Aam Aadmi Party, Kejriwal has also asked the poll panel to probe the possibility of EVMs being rigged.Also read | EVMs cannot be tampered with, integrity of electoral process intact: Election CommissionAlso read | AAP was sweeping Punjab, even BJP's Advani doubted EVMs: Kejriwal asks EC to probe alleged tampering
