 It isn't a movie, it is a religion: Star Wars director.
Director JJ Abrams says for Star Wars' rabid fanbase, the epic space opera franchise is a religion.While speaking at the Milen Global conference in Beverly Hills alongside Jon Favreau, Abrams said managing fans expectations can be difficult, reported The Wrap."Star Wars isn't a movie, it's a religion. But this religion people have, they don't always know how fungible these things are," said Abrams, who helmed the seventh instalment in the popular series, The Force Awakens.
