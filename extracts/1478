UK boss gives staff castle office with ice cave, ski lodge.
London, Jan 19 (PTI) The head of a website has been dubbed Britains best boss after he splurged a whopping three million pounds to create a dream castle office for his employees complete with a Star Wars-themed cinema, gaming arcade, yoga studio along with an "ice cave" for meetings. Chris Morling, founder of Money.co.uk, spent 3 million pounds on renovation of his office with impressive designing by Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen. Morling envisioned this style of workplace to keep his 50-strong staff "entertained and engaged" and to help attract the creme de la creme of the industry, The Sun reported. The spectacular building stands on the Bathurst Estate in Cirencester, East Gloucestershire. Based in a Victorian castle on the Bathurst Estate, other on-site luxuries include a weights gym, yoga studio and staff also enjoy free weekly sport matches -- which the boss himself gets involved in. Knowing it would be a tall order to convince future employees to work outside of the capital, Morling knew he had to offer them some unusual perks. And what better way to spice up a boring meeting than having it in an ice cave and ski lodge -- or a perfectly stylish library. Even the bathrooms are designed with Rolling Stones and Steam Punk influences to make going to the toilet as exciting as it possibly can be. And if employees are feeling hungry, there is free breakfast in the kitchen, complete with a pinball machine, PS4, pool table and football table. If that is not enough, all staff are treated to an all-expenses-paid mini break abroad each year to destinations such as Florida, New York, Budapest, Dubrovnik and Copenhagen.
