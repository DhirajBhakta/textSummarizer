Pakistan lawyers give PM Sharif 7-day deadline to resign.
The Supreme Court Bar Association and the Lahore High Court Bar Association have said they would launch a countrywide movement if Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif doesn't resign on the Panama Papers scandal in seven days. According to a report by The Dawn, the two bar associations in a joint declaration said that following the Supreme Court's order on the Panama Papers case, the Prime Minister should no longer hold the position and resign within seven days.This comes after the Supreme Court Bar Association and the Lahore High Court Bar Association members clashed with the lawyers supporting the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML_N) government. The incident took place at the all Pakistan lawyers' representatives' convention on May 19.SCBA President Rasheed A Rizvi was locked in the Lahore High Court's library by PML-N lawyers. The locks were broken by SCBA members and Rizvi was released during the ruckus. Police were called in to control the situation."Both bar associations are of the view that in light of the Supreme Court's ruling on the Panama Papers case (that questioned the moral authority of the premier to rule), PM Nawaz Sharif should no longer hold his office and should therefore resign," a joint statement issued by the both bar associations said after their convention in Lahore.It said the judgement in the Panama case has clearly indicted Sharif and his children for financial improprieties and corruption and a joint investigation team has been formed to probe him."For fair and independent inquiry against the premier, Nawaz Sharif should step down till the final report of the JIT. In case he does not resign till May 27 the lawyers throughout Pakistan will launch a nationwide campaign and movement to ensure his resignation," the statement said. The case against Sharif emerged last year after the Panama Papers leak linked his children to offshore companies in the British Virgin Islands in relation to the purchase of upmarket property in London.Sharif and his family have denied any wrongdoing.(With inputs from agencies)Also Read:Pakistan PM Nawaz Sharif feels the heat as Opposition slams government for mishandling Kulbhushan Jadhav's case at ICJ
