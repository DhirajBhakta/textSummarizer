No one has right to judge patriotism of others: RSS chief.
Bhopal, Feb 12 (PTI) RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat has said that no one has the right to judge others patriotism. "Doosre ki bhakti naapne ka adhikar kisi ko nahin hai, mujhe bhi nahin hai (No one has the right to measure anybodys patriotism. I too dont have the right)," Bhagwat said yesterday while releasing a book here. "Even if you thinks that you are running the show in the country, you cannot measure anybodys patriotism, or after evaluating it come out with a judgment on it that if this is the kind of bhakti (devotion) you have, then it is patriotism, otherwise it isnt," Bhagwat said.
