Dubai woman has baby from ovary frozen when she was 9.
While we were just about wrapping our heads around the awesome idea of getting our eggs frozen--for procreation later in life--a new piece of news has bowled us over.A 24-year-old woman from Dubai has had a baby using ovary tissues that were saved from before she hit puberty.Moaza Al Matrooshi delivered a baby boy at the privately-run Portland Hospital on December 13. She told the BBC, "It's like a miracle. We've been waiting so long for this result--a healthy baby. I always believed that I would be a mum and that I would have a baby. I didn't stop hoping and now I have this baby--it is a perfect feeling.Moaza's doctor, Sara Matthews, said, "This is a huge step forward. We know that ovarian tissue transplantation works for older women, but we've never known if we could take tissue from a child, freeze it and make it work again."The reason Moaza decided to freeze her ovarian tissue was because she was born with beta thalassaemia--a blood disorder that can prove to be fatal if left untreated. Moaza needed chemotherapy, which damages the ovaries, before receiving a bone marrow transplant.So, before her doctors started the treatment, when Moaza was nine years old, she had her right ovary removed in an operation in Leeds, where the tissue was frozen, reports BBC.
