Yogi sets June 15 deadline to make UP roads pothole-free.
Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath is turning to be a hard task-master for his bureaucrats. Yogi Adityanath has set a deadline for filling up all the potholes in Uttar Pradesh by June 15.Yogi Adityanath said, "We have asked (the concerned authorities) to ensure by June 15 Uttar Pradesh should become pothole-free."Taking a jibe on the previous Akhilesh Yadav government, Yogi Adityanath said, "It had become the identity of Uttar Pradesh that the spot from where potholes appear and where darkness sets in at the stroke of evening, the boundary of UP starts."Yogi Adityanath's comment is interesting in the wake of his predecessor Akhilesh Yadav's public claim about improving the roads of Uttar Pradesh. During the Assembly election, Akhilesh Yadav had even claimed that if PM Narendra Modi travelled on the roads built by his government, the Prime Minister would vote for Samajwadi Party.24-HOUR POWER TO DISTRICTSSpeaking at a function, organised for distributing assistive devices to specially-abled people, in Deoria, Yogi Adityanath said that his government would provide 24-hour power supply to all the 75 district headquarters in Uttar Pradesh.Yogi Adityanath said, "We will provide 24-hour power supply to every district headquarters.
