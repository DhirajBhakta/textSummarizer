Wanting MSD to bat, crowd chants 'Saurabh Tiwary haye haye'.
Fans who turned up to watch a MS Dhoni special returned disappointed even as Jharkhand cruised to a comfortable seven-wicket win over Services for their second victory in the Vijay Hazare Trophy on Tuesday.Chasing a stiff 277, Jharkhand did not require services of their captain 'cool' as Saurabh Tiwary (102 not out off 103 balls; 3x4, 6x6) and Ishank Jaggi (116 not out off 92 balls; 10x4, 4x6) put together an unbroken 214-run partnership to script a fluent chase with 22 balls to spare.He may not have played a role with the bat but Dhoni's tips during the drinks break played a big role in their win, Jaggi later revealed.

It's about staying there and finish the game'," Jaggi said.The lefthander Tiwary added: "We played without any pressure well aware of the fact that MS comes next."Jharkhand had a shaky build-up and were reduced to 65/3 inside 17 overs but poor fielding from Services let the duo build on a firm stand. Yet to open his account, Tiwary was dropped at mid-off by Shakti Malviya off Poonam Poonia, while Jaggi got a reprieve on 25.At 107/3 midway into their innings, the match tilted heavily in favour of Services with required run rate going past six.

We were subjected to much more sledging on the field."Having slowly built their innings, the duo took charge of the show and Jaggi completed his sixth List A century in 82 balls with a boundary in the 42nd over, while Tiwary followed suit reaching his second List A hundred in 100 balls.

But another collapse followed with Dhoni effecting a second runout to restrict the total.SUMMARISED SCORES
