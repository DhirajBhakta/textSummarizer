Delhi: CCTV captures man crushing puppies under car wheels.
A CCTV footage has emerged showing a person driving a WagonR ruthlessly crushing two puppies playing on the roadside in Vasant Kunj. The incident took place when the puppies were sitting on the roadside with their mother. In the video, the driver can be seen waiting at a distance while the puppies are playing towards the side of the street. While there was enough space for the car to pass by, the driver chose to turn left and drive straight towards the puppies.The driver drove over the puppies, crushing one of them to death and injuring the leg of the other. The dog, on seeing her puppies being crushed under the wheels, barked and chased the car helplessly but the driver did not stop or slow-down the car to check on the bleeding puppy.NO ACTION TAKEN EVEN 48 HOURS AFTER COMPLAINTThe heart-wrenching video was captured in the CCTV cameras of Sector B, Pocket 5 and 6 of Vasant Kunj. Some Good Samaritans, who had been feeding these puppies in the colony, filed a complaint at the Vasant Kunj North Police Station."Dogs in our colony have been poisoned several times in the past as well so it has not come as a surprise that the puppies have been crushed to death by one of the residents here. We had approached the police and filed a complaint but it has been over two days and no action has been taken yet," said the Good Samaritan, who does not wish to be named. "Running down or poisoning an animal is a direct violation of sections 428 and 429 of the IPC which require an FIR to be filed immediately. Even after two days of the complaint and repeated calls to the Vasant Kunj North police station regarding the case, no action has been taken," said Tarun Sarin, a volunteer with Dhyan Foundation, an animal rights NGO.ALSO READ|   When man bites a dog: Delhi resident chops off puppy's legs with hacksaw
