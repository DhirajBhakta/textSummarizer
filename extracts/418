It was silly of me: Dhanush on walking out of TV interview.
Dhanush recently walked out of the interview after the interviewer asked questions about his personal life. The video released by TV 9 Telugu was doing the rounds on the internet. According to a report in Deccan Chronicle, Dhanush feels it's silly of him to react that way.Talking about the incident, Dhanush was quoted as saying, "It was silly of me, I am generally a calm person, but I did react in a way I shouldn't have. My intention was clear. I didn't want to answer the question. But the strong reaction was unwarranted. Actually, I haven't slept for two weeks since I was busy with my upcoming film. Looking back, I am also surprised at the way I reacted. I should have simply asked the journalist to move on to the next question."The interviewer asked questions about the infamous Suchi leaks and used words like "allegations" and "videos".Before walking out, Dhanush said, "This is a really stupid interview."Meanwhile, Dhanush is presently in Malaysia to promote his upcoming action drama Velai Illa Pattadhaari 2, a sequel to the blockbuster Tamil film of the same name.Directed by Soundarya Rajinikanth, film also stars Kajol Devgn, Amala Paul, Samuthirakani and Vivek in important roles. VIP 2 has music by Sean Roldan and is expected to release in August.WATCH: Dhanush walks out of interview after question about personal life
