Snapdeal to home-deliver Reliance Jio SIMs.
If you still don't have a Reliance Jio SIM, now is a good time to get one for two reasons, you will get free 4G internet till March 31 and that you can get the Jio SIM delivered to your doorstep. Snapdeal has sent out an email to select customers saying that it will now home-deliver Jio SIM cards. Those who received the email can enter details and time when and where they want the SIM to be delivered.The mailer says that Snapdeal will choose their premium customers for this Jio home delivery service. "You are eligible to get a Reliance Jio SIM along with Jio Happy New Year Offer, delivered and activated at your home without any cost, provided you have a local valid Aadhar Card," reads the mailer.The customer will need to have a 4G-enabled phone and a local Aadhaar card at the time of delivery. The eKYC verification will be done at that time only.While this sounds like a good deal, we don't know how Snapdeal is going to decide who is a premium customer and who is not. So you can consider yourself in luck if you have received an email.Also read:  Jio Welcome Offer vs Happy New Year Offer: Here is what changed after Dec 3
