Complaint against Baahubali 2 director for casteist dialogue.
While Baahubali 2: The Conclusion is breaking records all over India and making a few abroad as well, back in Hyderabad, the film has enraged quite a few people.According to a report in The News Minute, members of a group called the Arekatika Porata Samithi filed a complaint with the Hyderabad police on Sunday against SS Rajamouli, the director of Baahubali 2: The Conclusion. The reason? Well, he has allegedly hurt the sentiments of the Katika community.The offensive Baahubali 2 scene in question features Katappa (Sathyaraj) saying "Katika cheekati" in the second half of the film. The group which has lodged the complaint says that the term is a 'caste slur' and since they are from the Katika caste, the dialogue was 'humiliating their community name'.The group has also filed a complaint with the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) where it has demanded for the words to be removed."We Katika people indulge in the trade of butchery, to sell meat of goats, sheep and hens, to provide healthy food to the society, as part of our livelihood. We are not harsh, inhuman and anti-social people as the movies try to portray us," the complaint read."We have become a synonym for any anti-social activities. Even in schools and colleges, our children are facing social stigma," the complaint went on to add.The Telangana and Andhra Pradesh governments recognise the Katika or the Arekatika community under the Backward Class (BC) category. However, a police officer belonging to the Banjara Hills police station, where the complaint was filed, said that no case has been registered against the makers of Baahubali 2: The Conclusion yet and that they are taking legal advice.
