Officials of UP Jal Nigam said that the Upper Ganga Canal (UGC) has been temporarily shut due to silt deposit caused by heavy rains in Uttarakhand.The UGC, which originates from Haridwar, supplies Ganga water to two treatment plants at Pratap Vihar in Ghaziabad where the water is treated and supplied to trans-Hindon areas of Ghaziabad and neighbouring Noida.The water supply through the canal has been stopped. We received the information on Thursday afternoon and it will be put into effect in 12 hours. The issues of low supply and disruption will persist for a couple of days. The water supply to the plant is low and it will decrease further by Friday, said Neelam, project manager of UP Jal Nigam at the Ganga water treatment plant in Ghaziabad.Residents in trans-Hindon areas said that their routine will be disrupted as a majority of the trans-Hindon population is dependent on Ganga water.It will be problematic as residents are primarily dependent on the Ganga water supply. We dont have groundwater supply. Also, we have not installed water purification systems and there will be a problem of unclean water supply, said Meenakshi Mishra, of Gyan Khand in Indirapuram.Read I Ganga water supply shut in Noida, GhaziabadGanga water supply in our area is comparatively low.
