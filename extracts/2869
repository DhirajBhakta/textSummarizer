I fear for my life: RJD man who failed to defend Lalu on TV.
Sanoj Yadav's Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) comradeship of 30 years failed to wane Bihar Health Minister Tej Pratap's ire towards him who thrashed him brutally in a party on Friday. An RJD loyalist and worker, Sanoj had a few days back appeared in a news debate on television where he was unable to defend Lalu Yadav and his family over allegations of corruption and acquiring benami properties. This enraged the young Yadav so much that he abused and thrashed Sanoj black and blue in their iftar party that was held on June 23, Friday. Sanoj Yadav expressed dismay and shock over the humiliation that he was subjected to in a gathering full of party cadres and ministers. He was also aghast at Lalu Yadav's inaction to control his son.Speaking to India Today, Sanoj said, "I have been a loyal worker of the party for last 30 years and today I have been humiliated by Lalu's son in such a manner that I am completely shattered." He added that now he fears for his life and has asked Chief Minister Nitish Kumar to expel Tej Pratap Yadav from his cabinet. Yadav further alleged that RJD has been completely hijacked by Tej Pratap Yadav.   "This is not the first time that a RJD worker has been beaten up and humiliated by Lalu's family members. Now I fear for my life from Tej Pratap Yadav and therefore I am appealing Chief Minister Nitish Kumar to take action against him and sack him from his cabinet", said Sanoj Yadav.Also read: Bihar ki beti will lose presidential election: Nitish on Meira Kumar
