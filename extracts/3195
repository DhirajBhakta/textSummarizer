Shahid tells Ishaan dating rumours can damage career: Report.
Ishaan Khatter is in news for his Bollywood debut as much as for his link-up rumours. If Shahid Kapoor's brother has made headlines for grabbing a project with Iranian filmmaker Majid Majidi, the 21-year-old actor's personal life too has also caught the fancy of many. And this has left elder brother Shahid a little miffed. It's been a while since Ishaan has been linked to Sridevi's daughter Jhanvi Kapoor after the two were spotted on a few movie and lunch dates. And the Udta Punjab actor, reportedly, isn't too pleased as he wants Ishaan to concentrate on his Bollywood debut. If reports are to be believed, Shahid doesn't want Ishaan's personal life to take away the focus from his debut film Beyond The Clouds. And that's the reason he has warned his brother to keep his private life discreet as these rumours can prove damaging for his career.Ishaan, who assisted Abhishek Chaubey in Udta Punjab, will make his big screen debut with a film on brother-sister relationship. Jhanvi, on the other hand, is busy prepping for her Bollywood debut. However, details of her big screen debut have been kept under the wraps.
