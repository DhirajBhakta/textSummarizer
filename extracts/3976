UP CM orders investigation into Gomti riverfront project.
Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath today ordered an investigation into the Gomti riverfront project within 45 days. Adityanath had earlier expressed dissatisfaction over the progress of the Akhilesh Yadav government's Gomti riverfront project.The project was launched to channelise the river by constructing a diaphragm wall and by landscaping and constructing intercepting drains on both banks.    Adityanath was unhappy that although two years had lapsed, and over Rs 1,427 crore had been spent, only 60 per cent of the work was complete, an official release said.While interacting with officials and staff involved in the project, Adityanath said a demand of an additional amount of Rs 1,500 crore was being made for the project, which was initially scheduled to be completed by May 2017."The aim of the project should have been cleaning the water and blocking the drains discharging sewage into the river, but that was not done," the chief minister said.LINK RIVERFRONT AND NAMAMI GANGE PROJECT: ADITYANATH Adityanath had asked officials to link the project with the Centre's Namami Gange project and start working to plug the drains discharging sewage into the river.He rued that the work was being carried out without keeping this in mind and instead, funds were being used on "unproductive" things such as erecting fountains and other decorative structures.Warning that his government would be firm in dealing with corruption and would not allow "loot" of government funds at any cost, the chief minister had ordered a review of the project within a week by the principal secretary of the department concerned to ascertain its actual cost.He'd also directed the principal secretaries of all the departments to review project works and check unnecessary expenditure, besides ensuring the completion of works in a "qualitative" manner.
