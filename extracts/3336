Relative may sue Johar for false claims in biography: Report.
Karan Johar's autobiography An Unsuitable Boy became a runaway bestseller within hours of hitting the stands. The book released earlier this year and the candid confessions in it by Karan Johar charmed readers and critics all across the country.However, as it turns out, Karan Johar may have lied about his family members in the book. According to a report in Indian Express, what Karan Johar has written about his father's family may be fiction and not fact.In An Unsuitable Boy, Karan Johar has written that on his father's side, his relatives were halwais (sweet-makers). He added that his father was the only family member who was somewhat educated and could speak in English which is why he got to sit at the sales counter. Shortly after, his father quit the job.The report says that in actuality, Karan Johar's grandfather was a government employee based in Lahore before starting a sweet shop in Delhi. Karan Johar's eldest uncle, Ved Prakash Johar, was a graduate of Lahore's Government College and was pally with the poet Faiz Ahmed Faiz. Ved later got a journalism degree from Columbia University in New York and joined the Indian Administrative Service (IAS). One of his other uncles was with the Indian Army and another aunt, college-educated, was a teacher.Apparently, only one uncle of Karan Johar was a halwai and he ran a sweet shop and restaurant called Nanking in Delhi's Connaught Place.
