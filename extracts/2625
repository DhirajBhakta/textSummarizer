CBFC Chief Pahlaj responds to Jagga Jasoos's U/A certificate.
Ranbir Kapoor and Katrina Kaif's Jagga Jasoos has been in the making for almost four years now. After months and months of delay, the film is finally ready to hit the screens on July 14. But a few days before its release, the makers were in for a shock when the Central Board of Film Certification decided to give it a U/A certificate. Ever since Ranbir and Katrina began the promotion of the film, Jagga Jasoos is touted to be a fantasy film meant for the children. But according to a report in DNA, CBFC did find something objectionable and has asked parents to accompany their kids during the film. This decision has made the makers quite unhappy. A source close to director Anurag Basu was quoted as telling the daily, "We wonder what the censor board saw in Jagga Jasoos that made it suitable for children only accompanied by an adult."The film revolves around the story of a boy in search of his father. However, Censor Board chief Pahlaj Nihalani had this to say in his defense, "Let the film release. The world will see why we think it is necessary for children to be accompanied by an adult."Directed by Anurag Basu, Jagga Jasoos also stars Saurabh Shukla and Sayani Gupta.
