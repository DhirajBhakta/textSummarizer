Thanks for bearing me: SRK on completing 25 yrs in Bollywood.
Shah Rukh Khan burst onto the Bollywood scene in 1992 with Deewana, and in no time, he had millions of girls swooning over his dimpled smile and wanting to run into his outstretched arms. Over two decades later, his ability to make girls go weak in the knees has not changed. The Baadshah of Bollywood completes 25 years in films today, and took to Twitter to thank his fans for all their love."Went 2 bed early cos been a hectic week.Woke up for no reason & realised I am 25 yrs old.Will deal with all this love tom.Thx for bearing me (sic)," he wrote.Went 2 bed early cos been a hectic week.Woke up for no reason & realised I am 25 yrs old.Will deal with all this love tom.Thx for bearing meFans started remembering their favourite Shah Rukh moments, tweeting it with the hashtag #25YearsOfSRK.Karan Johar, who directed SRK in his directorial debut, Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, tweeted, "Have had the honour of working with him for 22 of those 25 years....love you so much Bhai @iamsrk...And thank you for everything....."Have had the honour of working with him for 22 of those 25 years....love you so much Bhai @iamsrk...And thank you for everything.....â¤ï¸â¤ï¸â¤ï¸ https://t.co/k4e5ouQ0ILRed Chillies Entertainment shared a montage of Shah Rukh's cinematic moments with his Dilwale dialogue playing in the background, "Dil toh har kisi ke paas hota hai.
