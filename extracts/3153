Sanjay Dutt biopic's release date postponed to next year.
One of the biggest box-office clashes of 2017 got averted when Rajkumar Hirani decided to postpone the release of Sanjay Dutt biopic. Earlier the film was supposed to clash with Salman Khan and Katrina Kaif-starrer Tiger Zinda Hai. But that seems to be not happening anymore. Sanjay Dutt biopic will now hit the screens in 2018, while Tiger Zinda Hai will release this Christmas. Trade Analyst Taran Adarsh took to Twitter to confirm the news and revealed that the Dutt biopic will now release on March 30, 2018.#BreakingNews: Sanjay Dutt biopic to release on 30 March 2018... Rajkumar Hirani directs... Stars Ranbir Kapoor... NOTE: Not titled yet. It seems Hirani did not want to release Sanjay Dutt biopic along with another big-budget film. A source was quoted as telling Deccan Chronicle, "This biopic is one of the most awaited films in recent times. We have to release it at a time when it can garner maximum eyeballs. We know Salman has a huge fan following, so it only made business sense to avoid the on-screen clash." The biopic will focus on Sanjay's formative years, his relation with his father Sunil Dutt, his struggles coping up with the loss of his mother and his many affairs.
