Scrap Kashmir's special status in 8 days: Shiv Sena to BJP.
To rein in terrorism in Kashmir, the Shiv Sena has urged the Narendra Modi-led Union government to scrap Article 370 that gives special status to the state within eight days and show that Kashmir is an integral part of India.In an editorial in the Senas mouthpiece, Saamana, the party said while terrorism was rampant in Kashmir during the Congress-led regime, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government too has not been able to change the situation and it is time for tough action.The party said, If you want to send a strong message to extremists and Pakistan, show that Kashmir is an integral part of India by scrapping Article 370, which gives special status to the state in the next eight days. The country needs action and for that it is alright even if Prime Minister Narendra Modi has to imbibe Hitlers form.Read more: Mere condemnation of Amarnath attack wont do, time for PM Modi to prove he has 56-inch chest, says SenaThe Sena said it is unfortunate that while the Union government celebrated the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax in the entire country it could not apply the single levy that has unified the country to Kashmir due to Article 370. The party said the country remembers Sena founder Bal Thackeray who took a tough stand against any kind of attacks on the Amarnath Yatra that ensured its smooth functioning for the next 20-25 years. The Shiv Sena had on Tuesday condemned the attacks on Amarnath yatra pilgrims in Kashmir, saying now was the time for the government to show the might of the much-touted 56-inch chest. Seven people died in the attacks while several others were injured.The party in the editorial said, All this was happening during the Congress governments rule and so the public elected a change to have a courageous government. But though the government changed, the situation in Kashmir has not changed at all.
