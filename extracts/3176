Katrina denies getting Deepika dropped from SRK's film.
Katrina Kaif has got to be the luckiest leading lady in B-Town. After Tiger Zinda Hai with Salman Khan and Thugs of Hindostan with Aamir Khan, reports suggested that Kat has signed Aanand L Rai's next with Shah Rukh Khan. Although there has been no official announcement from the makers, gossip columns insist that it is confirmed.When DNA asked Katrina about it, she said, "With every film, comes a speculative story announcement! That's the one aspect of my life I never play around with because that is my work at the end of the day, and a place where one must behave in an absolutely professional manner and till the time it's confirmed and signed, I don't believe it's right to discuss or talk about it."It was also being said that Deepika Padukone was supposed to be SRK's other leading lady, but speculation was rife that she was dropped on Katrina's insistence and Alia was roped in instead. The Baar Baar Dekho actor rubbished the rumours and said, "I don't think any actor in today's day and age is going around putting stipulations on their director. I am not comfortable talking about or having discussions on any film. I would rather like to give the directors their professional space to sort out or go through this process."ALSO READ: Katrina Kaif's friend says Deepika Padukone is insecure about her
