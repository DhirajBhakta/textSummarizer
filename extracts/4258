We're not public property: Vidya on man misbehaving with her.
Vidya Balan had an apt response for a man who misbehaved with her at the Kolkata airport recently. The actor, who is currently busy promoting her upcoming film Begum Jaan, was at the airport when a man asked her if she could click a selfie with her.Till this point, everything was fine, says a report in Spotboye.com. When Vidya agreed to the selfie, she realised the man had put his arm around her. She objected to it, saying, "Don't." The man took off his arm but put it back around her again before clicking the photo.This is when Vidya lost it. The Kahaani actor screamed, "What do you think you're doing?", says the report.To this, the man pressed for a selfie yet again. An angry Vidya responded, "No, you can't! Behave yourself."When the website spoke to Vidya about this, she said, "When a stranger puts an arm around you, be it a man or a woman you get uncomfortable because they are intruding into your personal space. We are public figures, not public property."The actor was in the West Bengal capital with her Begum Jaan director Srijit Mukherji and producer Mahesh Bhatt.
