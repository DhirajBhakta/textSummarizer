Wish media hadn't leaked Ranbir's look from Dutt biopic: Dia.
Ranbir Kapoor's new look from Sanjay Dutt's biopic has gone viral online but his onscreen wife Dia Mirza feels it should not have been leaked. "You should not have seen that look. It was leaked by the media... I will admit it was upsetting that the look was out as we were saving the look to reveal much later. We are enthused with the response from the public but we wish the media had respected the privacy of the film and not revealed the look," Dia told reporters here. In the Rajkumar Hirani-directed film, Dia plays the role of Maanayata, Dutt's wife. "Shooting is going really well. I have just completed my work. It's such a privilege and honour to be working with such a wonderful set of people. Rajkumar Hirani had directed me in Lage Raho Munnabhai and it was great to be working with him again," she said, adding, "Right now we all are tight-lipped about the film but we can't wait to reveal things." Dia has teamed up for the first time with Ranbir, and she is all praise for her co-star. "Ranbir is amazing and there are no two ways about it," the actor said. The film also stars Vicky Kaushal as Sanjay Dutt's close friend, Manisha Koirala as Nargis Dutt and Paresh Rawal as Sunil Dutt.
