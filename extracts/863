India's first Food Truck Park opens in Mumbai.
When it comes to making headway in the world of food, Mumbai runs faster than any other Indian city. From adapting the purple food trend to serving dishes from all over the world, this city has done it all. Its food trucks are very popular and quite successful.But the thing with food trucks is that you have to be in a certain area to access the delicacies they serve, or wait for a food truck fest (which have been quite the rage over the last two years in both Mumbai and Delhi). What India needs is a food truck park, like the ones across the USA and Dubai.Also Read: Meet the superwomen who run Asia's first all-women food truck in Bengaluru And now, India does have one!
