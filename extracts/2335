People say they loved my films, then ask my name: Pankaj.
Actor Pankaj Tripathi  has been a part of popular films such as Agneepath (2012), Gangs of Wasseypur I and II (2012) and Fukrey (2013). Despite being a known face and a critically acclaimed actor, more often than not, people tend to ask him his name but that doesnt bother him. Pankaj explains, I have been in the industry for many years now, but people still come up to me and say Sir, youre such a good actor, we loved watching you in that movie. Whats your name While any other actor might get offended, I dont mind this at all.The actor believes in letting his work do the talking. Naam mein kya hai People can forget your name, but if you excel at what you do, at least someone will remember you, he says, adding that people have to Google to see who he is. However, Pankaj feels that theres a positive side to this as well. The very fact that people make an effort to search and know more about me is a testament that I am doing my job well, he says.Pankaj is now gearing up to act alongside actor Rajinikanth in the upcoming multilingual film titled Kaala Karikalan, where he will play the role of a policeman. All praises for the 66-year-old Rajinikanth, Pankaj says, He is a legend for me. His real-life is a far cry from the larger-than-life roles he plays on screen. Extremely humble, he believes in simplicity. The only reason I took up this role was to see this great man from close quarters.Follow @htshowbiz for moreFollow@htshowbiz for more
