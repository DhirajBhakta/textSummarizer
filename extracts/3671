CM Kejriwal casts his vote, appeals to vote against garbage.
All eyes are on the national capital today as Delhi votes for its civic bodies in the MCD election 2017. The polls are being closely watched in national politics, with the Bharatiya Janata Party, Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party all in fray. There's a lot at stake for three main contenders. The BJP will look to continue its winning momentum, having resoundingly won Uttar Pradesh in the recent Assembly elections as well as a number of civic bodies in Maharashtra and Odisha. For Congress, the MCD election could be a chance to save face after embarrassing defeats across the country. The party's most recent failure was in the civic polls of Latur, the Maharashtra stronghold that was in the Grand Old Party's control ever since independence. Meanwhile, the AAP will be hoping for some redemption after bruising defeats in Punjab and Goa put brakes on Arvind Kejriwal-led party's dreams of going national. Swaraj India, the party led by Kejriwal's former Indian Against Corruption partner Yogendra Yadav, is also in the fray for Delhi's civic bodies. The counting of votes will take place on April 26.
