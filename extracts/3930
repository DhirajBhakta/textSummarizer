Jayalalithaa will not be declared a convict in DA case: SC.
Jayalalithaa will not be declared a convict in the disproportionate assets case, the Supreme Court ruled today. The apex court dismissed Karnataka government's review petition to declare former chief minister of Tamil Nadu J Jayalalithaa a convict in the DA case.The Congress-led Karnataka government also wanted Rs 100 crore fine imposed by the trial court on Jayalalithaa to be recovered by selling her properties. This too was rejected by the Supreme Court. The Karnataka government argued that for the state to recover the Rs 100 crore penalty, the former Tamil Nadu chief minister had to be held guilty. In its review petition to the Supreme Court, the Karnataka government had said that apex court's decision to abate proceedings against late Jayalalithaa was an "error apparent on the face of record".  In February, the Supreme Court had set aside the Karnataka High Court judgment of May 2015 which had acquitted Sasikala Natarajan and former Tamil Nadu chief minister Jayalalithaa. The Supreme Court had upheld the trial court's judgment convicting Sasikala in the 21-year-old disproportionate assets case. The apex court had said that since Jayalalithaa is no more, the proceedings against her will be abated.ALSO READ:Sasikala convicted in DA case, she must serve remaining jail term, rules Supreme Court
