Choose BJP, blame yourself for dengue, chikungunya: Kejriwal.
Two days before the Delhi MCD elections, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal lashed out against BJP and Congress and appealed to the people not vote for them. Targeting BJP, he further said, "if your children get dengue or chikungunya, then you yourself will be responsible for it, because you voted for a party that spreads mosquitoes that breed dengue or chikungunya."He said that, "BJP is in MCD for the last 10 years but still it cannot clean Delhi. How a party can clean Delhi if it cannot get rid of mosquitoes in 10 years And if you vote BJP, then in the coming 5 years, there will be so much garbage in Delhi that people will have dengue and chikungunya."While talking about Congress, Kejriwal said, "Congress has lost its hold over the country and is finished in Delhi. People should not waste their votes by voting for Congress."He further said that, "We are getting complaints about water and electricity shortage. I want to tell the people of Delhi that BJP and Congress workers have stolen oil from 70 places, and at many places they have put cement in sewer pipelines because of which water is flowing on roads at some places. Till Sunday, these people will steal oil and create water scarcity in the city.Polling for the upcoming MCD election ends today evening. The AAP is fighting in all the 272 wards.
