Pakistan fan sledges Mohammed Shami after India's CT defeat.
Virat Kohli was all grace and smiles after India's crushing defeat in the ICC Champions Trophy final but the Pakistani fans were downright nasty to the India skipper and his teammates.Pakistan's victory at The Oval triggered massive celebrations in and around the ground with fans dancing on the streets of London till the wee hours of the night. Fans who were supporting Sarfraz Ahmed's team inside the stadium stayed there till the presentation ceremony and it was during this period that a particular Pakistani fan started to sledge the Indian players just as they were returning to their dressing room.In a video posted on Facebook by The Witty Side, a fan could be seen mocking the Indian players and passing derogatory comments to Kohli, fast bowler Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Jasprit Bumrah and the rest.The guy in the video could be heard telling Kohli - "akkad toot gayi hai Kohli saari" - which loosely translates to - your arrogance has been shattered. Kohli paid no heed to the comments and walked away but the guy continued to sledge the players and even made weeping sounds.He could then be heard saying, "baap kaun hai", and that is when fast bowler Mohammed Shami lost his cool and turned back towards the Pakistani fan before MS Dhoni intervened and took his teammate away with him.
