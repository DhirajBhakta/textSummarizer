Pak fears India may use flag at Attari for spying: Report.
India on Sunday hoisted the tallest tricolour in the country at the Attari border. The 360-foot tall flag is high enough to be spotted from Lahore in Pakistan. Hoisted on a 110-meter high mast, the flag is 120-foot long and 80-foot wide. The weight of the flag pole is 55 tonnes, and an estimated Rs 3.50 crore rupees have been spent on this project by the Punjab government.Before this, the title of the tallest national flag in India belonged to a 293-foot-high tricolour that was hoisted in Jharkhand's Ranchi. PAKISTAN OBJECTSInterestingly, Pakistan is not happy with India's decision to hoist the tricolour at the international border. Sources said the Pakistan Rangers had also conveyed their resentment to the Border Security Force (BSF) and had asked them to install the flag away from the border.Pakistan on Thursday had again raised an objection to the flag being flown at the IB, calling the act a violation of international treaties. Pakistan authorities apparently fear that India could use the mast to spy in Pakistani land by installing cameras on the flag pole.INDIA: NOT VIOLATING ANY TREATYHowever, Indian authorities had made it clear that the flat was being installed 200 metres before the zero line and was not a violation in any manner."Not to my knowledge. It is our national flag and nobody can stop us from hoisting it on our soil," said Anil Joshi, a minister in the Punjab government, who hoisted the flag on Sunday.
