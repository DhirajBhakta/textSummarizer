The Army aircraft, PZL M28 Skytruck with call sign NA- 048, was carrying food supplies from Nepalgunj to the mountainous district of Humla in far-west Nepal. The plane was to land at the Simikot airport in Humla district. But, due to bad weather it was flown to Bajura where the pilot tried to force-land it resulting in the accident. The plane overshot the runway for about 50 metres and overturned on a field, an airport official said.
