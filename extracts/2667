Govt approves renaming of Ganda, Kinnar villages in Haryana.
Chandigarh, Jul 6 (PTI) The Centre has approved renaming of Ganda and Kinnar villages in Fatehabad and Hisar districts of Haryana. Union Ministry of Home Affairs has approved the renaming of two villages in Haryana, an official spokesman said here this evening. Village Ganda has been renamed as Ajit Nagar, whereas village Kinnar has been rechristened as Gaibi Nagar, the official said. The Haryana government had recently changed the names of both villages on the demand of local residents who said they felt "embarrassed" with such names. Notably, a teenaged girl from Ganda (which means dirty in English), Harpreet Kaur Malkat, had written a letter to the Prime Minister seeking change of name of her village.
