Nirbhaya rape convicts on 'suicide watch' after SC verdict.
Presently lodged in Tihar jail, the four men sentenced to death in the December 16 gang rape and murder case, will be kept under strict suicide watch again. One of the accused, Ram Singh, hanged himself in prison on March 11, 2013, within three months of his arrest. Jail officials said that the wardens in the respective jails where they are lodged have been told to stay vigilant and report any abnormality in the behaviour of the four. Though the Supreme Court ordered death for the four convicts, the mother of the 23-year-old paramedic had told Hindustan Times that it is difficult for her to accept that one of the convicts (juvenile) is a free man. ?He was released because he was a child but what that boy did to my girl is not a child?s act. I can never forgive him,? she told HT on Thursday.The Supreme Court on Friday ordered that all four convicts in the gang-rape and murder case of a 23-year-old paramedic student be sent to the gallows.While pronouncing the verdict the court observed that the incident ?is a tsunami of shock in the minds of the collective destroyed humanity?.?The devilish manner in which the accused played with the victim is diabolical,? the court said.The convicts had been awarded death by a fast-track court on September 13, 2013, which was later upheld by the Delhi high court.Speaking to the Hindustan Times on Friday, the victim?s mother had demanded that her daughter?s rapists and killers be hanged to death. ??The court must sentence them to death. We won?t settle for life imprisonment. I am alive and kept myself strong only to see this day,? the mother told HT over the phone..
