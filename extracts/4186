40 pilots of Air Costa quit over non-payment of salaries.
New Delhi, Mar 19 (PTI) Embattled Air Costa has seen an exodus of employees, including 40 pilots, in the last few weeks over non-payment of salaries. The airline, which has cancelled bookings till May, is scrambling for funds to restart its operations but is yet to make much headway in roping in investors. Air Costas 450-odd employees are literally at the crossroads amid worsening financial situation, and industry executives apprehend there could be a replay of erstwhile Kingfisher Airlines -- whose shuttering in 2012 had rendered hundreds of people jobless.
