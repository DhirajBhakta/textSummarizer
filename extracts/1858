Sports Min Goel not interested in sports: Abhay Chautala.
Abhay Chautala, who is an accused in a disproportionate assets case, has been made life president of the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) and in a brazen show of self praise, the scam tainted son of former Haryana CM Om Prakash Chautala has justified the move.Suresh Kalmadi, who is an accused in the 2010 Commonwealth Games scam, has also been made life president by the IOA. He has also served nine-month jail term. Hitting out at Sports Minister Vijay Goel for expressing shock over his appointment, Chautala, who served as the president of the IOA from 2012 to 2014,  said it was because of his policies that India won medals at various international events. HERE'S WHAT CHAUTALA SAID: CHAUTALA'S APPOINTMENT SHOCKING: GOELSports Minister Vijay Goel while expressing shock over Chautala's plum posting said the ministry has sought details from the association and will take necessary steps."We are shocked at the resolution passed by IOA to make Suresh Kalmadi and Abhay Chautala life presidents. This is totally unacceptable to us as both of them are facing serious corruption and criminal charges," Goel said. "We have sought a report from the IOA and action will be taken once we get that report," he added.There was a move to oust current IOA president N. Ramachandran a little while back before Chautala had to put his foot down and ensured Ramachandran continues to remain at the helm.As life presidents, Kalmadi and Chautala will not have the voting rights but the top IOA functionaries saw this as an opportunity to reward the two bigwigs who still are capable to pulling the strings in the body.
