Govt bans presenting flower bouquets to welcome PM Modi.
During Prime Minister Narendra Modi's programs throughout the country, it is customary for the organisers to welcome him with a flower bouquet.But now the Ministry of Home Affairs has directed all state governments and union territories that no bouquet should be presented to PM Modi."I am directed to state that it has been desired by the competent authority that no bouquet may be presented to the prime minister during his tours within India," an MHA notice said.The Ministry has made it clear that, at best, a flower along with a khadi handkerchief or a book may be presented to welcome the dignitary."All states and union territories are requested to suitably sensitise all concerned to ensure strict compliance of the above instructions," it said.WHY DID MODI SAY NO TO FLOWERS?During one his 'Mann ki Baat' programs earlier this year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said people should gift useful stuff like books or handkerchieves rather than flower bouquets which land up in dustbin after few days."We should gift Khadi handkerchieves as it will help poor artisans, and books so that people are inspired to get into the habit of reading," PM Modi has said."I would not reject if someone gifts me a bouquet but I feel that this issue should continue to be discussed," Modi had said.
