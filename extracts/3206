Don't mind men flirting with me, it's a compliment: Sushant.
Sushant Singh Rajput is currently on cloud number nine. He had a fantastic 2016 with his film MS Dhoni: The Untold Story earning more than Rs 100 crore at the Indian box office. Now he has a range of films lined up, in various stages of production, the latest being Raabta which stars Sushant's rumoured ladylove, Kriti Sanon.Given Sushant's good looks and his new-found success, it is understandable that women would like to hit on him these days. But it's not just the fairer sex who take an interest in Sushant. When Filmfare Magazine recently asked him about his thoughts on the attention he gets from his male fans, the actor was at his nonchalant best.So, do men hit on him and does he like it? "Probably... but I don't get to know. Normally, you sense things that you expect. And that's not what I'm expecting. So I don't get it many times but there are times when I do understand. I don't mind it. It's a compliment," Sushant Singh Rajput said.Sushant Singh Rajput is rumoured to be dating Kriti Sanon though neither of them have officially confirmed or denied the buzz. Regardless of its truth, the dating rumours can only add to the pre-release noise around Raabta, for now, and that isn't harmful.
