Can't take ownership of film: Shahid on Rangoon's failure.
When Shahid Kapoor and Vishal Bharadwaj announced their third collaboration after Kaminey and Haider, the expectations were sky-high. However, Rangoon failed to set the cash registers ringing and fizzled out at the box office after earning only around Rs 20 crore.In an interview with Filmfare, Shahid talked about the debacle of his last release. "When a film doesn't do the kind of business or get the appreciation it should get, it's heartbreaking. I was fortunate that people liked me in Rangoon... Regardless of anything, people have liked my work in his films. I was happy I got recognised. But I am sure when we work together again we will do something great," the actor said.Shahid added that the failure of the film was not on him. "Rangoon as a film had many energies and many people. I can't take ownership of the film. I am happy my part was appreciated but I am sad for the film not doing well," he said.Shahid will be seen next in Sanjay Leela Bhansali's Padmavati, which also features Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh. The film is scheduled to release in November this year.
