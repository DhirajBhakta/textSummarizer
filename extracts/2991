Will make omelettes out of eggs hurled at me: BJP leader.
"There is not an iota of fear in me. I heard some people hurled eggs. I am a non-vegetarian. If BJD and Congress workers hurl eggs at me, I'll make omelette with it and eat that."These were the words of Minister of State for Heavy Industries Babul Supriyo after he was asked to respond to the incident of eggs being thrown at Union Minister Jual Oram on the latter's visit to Odisha's Kendrapara.On 13 June, Union Minister of Tribal Affairs, Jual Oram was on a visit to Aul Bazaar in Kendrapara district, where both Congress and BJD workers protested over his presence. Oram went to review the situation on the Mahanadi water dispute. The Biju Janta Dal workers hurled eggs at his vehicle, and on the other hand the Congress activists showed black flags targeting him for the farmers' killing in Mandsaur.Meanwhile, Supriyo targetted both the BJD and the Congress in Odisha. The singer-turned-politician said that he is not scared of anyone in the state, as he belongs to West Bengal where the "political situation is worse"."The BJD and Congress are creating hindrances for the welfare schemes of the Centre to reach the people," Supriyo added.
