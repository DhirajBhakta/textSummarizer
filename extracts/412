The Kerala police suspect Rimi Tomy's alleged involvement.According to a report in The News Minute, Rimi Tomy quashed the baseless reports and said she had no such dealings with Dileep.

I have no problems with the actor who was assaulted," she was quoted as saying.Earlier this month, actor Dileep was arrested on the charges of criminal conspiracy in the Malayalam actress case.
