I have no equation or relationship with Irrfan: Nawazuddin.
Cinegoers are always in for a treat when two powerhouse performers like Nawazuddin Siddiqui and Irrfan come together. The two have acted together in films like Paan Singh Tomar and Lunchbox, but their relationship is strictly professional, Nawazuddin said. In an interview with Mumbai Mirror, where he was talking about his relationship with the Khans (Shah Rukh, Salman and Aamir), he was asked about Irrfan."I thought the fourth Khan we'd talk about would be Saif Ali Khan Isn't he bigger I have no equation or relationship with Irrfan. Mere acting ka alag tareeka hai... Uska apna alag tareeka hai (My acting style is different from his)," the Gangs Of Wasseypur actor replied. Reportedly, Nawazuddin and Irrfan stayed together in a one-room apartment when they were still struggling. However, they drifted apart once Irrfan rose to fame. Nawazuddin had told PTI in an earlier interview, "We were never friends earlier also and not now as well. We work together whenever we are cast in a film together." However, the actor rubbished rumours of a rift and said, "There is no rivalry with him. There is nothing like that. He is my senior and I respect him a lot."
