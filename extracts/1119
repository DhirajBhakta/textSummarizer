That is if Australia play well.""Otherwise, 4-0," he was quoted as saying.

The Aussies later defeated India 2-0 in a four-Test rubber played Down Under in the 2014-15 season.Australia have never won a Test match in India since 2004 and their last series win in Asia came against Sri Lanka in 2011. They have since suffered nine straight Test losses in the subcontinent. Harbhajan, who is also a long-time antagonist of Australia, believes the lack of batting experience of the Steve Smith-led side in Asia will act as their biggest downfall.

If the ball starts spinning from the first ball, I don't think they will survive for long," he said.He said apart from David Warner and Smith, the other Australian batsmen won't be able to play the game as they play in Australian conditions."That Australian team in the past had so much will and belief. I don't think this team has the belief to win in these conditions," he said.
