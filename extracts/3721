Panama Papers: Pak SC orders probe against PM Nawaz Sharif.
Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif will have to appear before a Joint Investigation Team (JIT) which will probe his family's involvement in corruption as claimed in the Panama Papers leak, the country's Supreme Court today. The commission has 60 days to submit its report to the top court. The Supreme Court verdict was split 3-2 as two judges wanted the Pakistan PM to be disqualified while facing trial. Three other members of the 5-judge bench were in the favour of further probe in the matter. The JIT will include officials from National Accountability Bureau (NAB), Federal Investigation Agency (FIA), Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan, Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) and Military Intelligence, the Supreme Court bench said. The JIT will be headed by a director-general level FIA officer. Praise & glory be to Allah alone.
