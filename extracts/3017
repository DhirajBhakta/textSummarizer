SRK's 1997 Paris doodle to be sold for ?2 lakh: Report.
Shah Rukh Khan was in Paris long ago, when he doodled certain things on a piece of paper. Little did he know back then that the piece of paper would go on to fetch about Rs 2 lakh some day. The doodle is from Shah Rukh's 1997 Paris visit and is soon going to be auctioned off.The doodle, which has the Eiffel Tower in the centre, with King Kong climbing the monument with the damsel in distress, is all set to go under the hammer. A report in Mid-Day says that the obscure sketch is to be auctioned at Osian's The Greatest Indian Show On Earth 2. The auction is to take place at a high-end hotel in Bandra, Mumbai, on June 22.Shah Rukh's idea of France is laid out on the sketch. Apart from the Eiffel, there is the Bastille, the Concorde, Voltaire, French kissing, the French connection, the French Revolution and former French president Charles de Gaulle among other things. And there are stick-figures of a man and woman with 'Tu Mera Hero No. 1' too on the sketch.SRK's parting words - and the gospel truth for every Indian visiting Paris - are 'In Paris, do as the Indians do'. The doodle includes SRK's signature too.
