Bihar class 12 topper missing after results, scam suspected.
The results of the class 12 Bihar Board has once again stirred controversy as Humanities topper Ganesh Kumar is untraceable since the examination results were declared on Tuesday.A resident of Saraiya, Giridih in Jharkhand, Ganesh Kumar was a student of Ram Nandan Singh Jagdeep Narayan college in Samastipur, 250 kms from Giridih. Kumar went underground soon after the results were declared, triggering suspicion over him securing the top spot in the Bihar Board examination.India Today, on Wednesday, reached Samastipur and while investigating, managed to get the admission form of Ganesh, which he had submitted in the college while taking admission in 2015. A look at the admission forms raises several questions regarding Ganesh Kumar: "I am surprised that he has topped the Arts stream of the Bihar Board," said Jawahar Prasad, founder secretary of the college.India Today is also in possession of the intermediate marksheet of Ganesh Kumar, which is also raising questions. He secured 65 out of 70 in music (practical) and 18 out of 30 in theory. He also secured 92 marks out of 100 in Hindi.When India Today contacted Ganesh's family in Giridih, her sister Mukta said that he had left home almost four years back and did not go home all these years."He left home four years back and during this time he never came to Giridih," said Mukta.It is notable that India Today, last year, unearthed the toppers scam and exposed how students became fake toppers after shelling out huge amount of money. This year, the Bihar School Examination Board claimed to have conducted the examination in a strict manner. This lead to the result with 64 per cent students having failed the examination. However, Ganesh being untraceable ever since has once again brought the Board results under scanner.ALSO READ|  Bihar topper scam mastermind Bachcha Rai's conditional bail scrapped, to remain in jail
