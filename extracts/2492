Court quashes case when man agrees to clean children's home.
The Bombay high court struck down criminal proceedings against a 20-year-old who was held for allegedly stalking and sexually harassing a woman, after he promised to clean, sweep and mop Padmavati Balkashram  a childrens home at Mohol in Solapur  every Sunday for the next three months.The bench said it tookDnyneshwar Pawars age and willingness to perform community service into consideration while granting him conditional relief. The first information report (FIR) registered against Pawar will be struck down only after he produces a certificate issued by head of the childrens home, which states that he has satisfactorily performed the community service.A division bench of justices Ranjit More and Sarang Kotwal also ordered him to pay Rs10,000 to the Kirtikar Law library.The judges said continuing criminal proceedings would have hampered Pawars career, especially as he and the woman had settled the matter amicably.Keeping the FIR alive has no purpose. It will only burden criminal courts, which are currently overburdened, they added.Continuing the case will only amount to abuse of the courts processes and it is thus necessary to quash the FIR to secure justice, said the bench.The bench said that if Pawar failed to produce a certificate issued by head of Padmavati Balkashram within four months, proceedings against him will restart.
