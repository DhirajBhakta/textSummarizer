This is the first seizure of 100 rupee notes post demonetisation. One of the main aims of demonetising high value bank notes  was to stop fake currency being pumped into the economy. But a spate of seizures recently, including some  of high denominations, indicate that  counterfeiters do not seem to have been hit hard.Last month, the Special Cell of Delhi Police arrested three men and claimed to have busted a fake currency printing racket. Counterfeit notes in the denomination of Rs 2,000 with a total face value of Rs 18 lakh were seized from them.Also read |Demonetisation affects Nepal, black marketing of currency rampant at border
