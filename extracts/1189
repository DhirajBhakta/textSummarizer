Katrina to turn producer and launch sister in B'wood: Report.
When Katrina Kaif's younger sister Isabel made her film debut with Canadian romantic comedy Dr Cabbie, Kat was proud. She had said at the time, "If she wants to get into Bollywood films then I am here. I will do everything I can to help her." And it looks like Katrina might keep her word by launching Isabel in her own production.Recently, rumours were doing the rounds that Katrina has asked close friend Salman Khan to launch her sister. In fact, Salman was one of the co-producers of Isabel's debut film, and had even said that she was more talented than Kat.However, Mumbai Mirror quotes a source as saying, "Katrina and Salman discuss films extensively and are like family to each other. She has shown interest in venturing into film production soon while simultaneously balancing her acting gigs and has been reading scripts, discussing films with her close director friends as well. If there's anyone who'll launch her sister in a big Bollywood production, it'll be Katrina herself."
