Centre asks AAP to explain party's overseas funding.
The ruling Aam Aadmi Party in Delhi was today asked by the Narendra Modi government to furnish details of overseas funding to it following suspicion that it might have violated the provisions of the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act, an official said.In a communication, the Union Home Ministry asked the Arvind Kejriwal-led party to explain certain fundings from abroad after suspecting that it might have violated FCRA provisions.The MHA official said the communication to AAP was part of its "routine" queries sent to a few other political parties regarding overseas funding to them.The official made it clear that it was not a show cause notice and a decision on it would be taken only after the AAP submits its reply.AAP'S RESPONSE AAP's statement on the Home Ministry's notice called it a "political witch hunt." "We have nothing to hide. We are ready to face any probe and party will fully cooperate with all concerned officials and agencies. It's worth mentioning that the Ministry of Home Affairs had given us a clean chit before the High Court on this issue and now they are sending us fresh notices," the party said."It is a clear case of political witch hunt. All the agencies at Centre's disposal have been unleashed against Aam Aadmi Party, its government in Delhi and its ministers. Which is very dangerous for democracy," it added.
