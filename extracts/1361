Sachin says he changed playing style after waiter's advice.
Sachin Tendulkar has kept himself completely engaged in various social and business endevours after retirement. In a glitzy event in Mumbai, the cricket legend launched his own sports equipment and sportswear range 'Sachin by Spartan'. To underline how much of a personal touch there is to his co-creation and his own knowledge of his equipment, Sachin shared some delightful insights at the launch event.OPEN TO ADVICE"If you have an open mind you can develop so many things. In Chennai it was a waiter who came up to me and said if you don't mind and don't get offended I want to tell you something. I said go ahead. He said my elbow guard restricts my bat swing. And he was 100 percent right."I knew I was feeling uncomfortable but I never thought of doing it myself. A few years down the line I got hit a couple of times on my elbow guard and it hurt. That's when I realised padding on elbow guard is inadequate. I instantly redesigned my elbow guard. I needed to re-open it and work on it. Get the fibre and cushion on either side to absorb the impact. In our country everyone from panwala to CEOs will give you advice. But one should still be open about ideas." TRICOLOUR ON BAT "In the last match I played for India, my bat had India colours. It was my way of thanking the fans who have always stayed with me."BAT SPEAKS WITH ME
