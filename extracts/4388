Singer-actor Suchitra, who is known for her hit songs like Uyirin Uyire, May Maasam 98'il and Dole Dole, created a storm when she posted a series of tweets attacking South superstar Dhanush. However, her husband, actor Karthik Kumar, claimed that her Twitter account was hacked. Now, Suchitra seems to have leaked private pictures of celebrities like Dhanush, Trisha, Hansika Motwani and Anirudh Ravichander, among others.The photos have now been deleted, but not before already going viral. Suchitra took to Twitter to write that her account had been hacked again. "Please guys - I don't even socialize with actors, I don't have any of their pictures. More than anything - I am not a mean person. The person who is doing this, wants me to deactivate my acct. I'll do that in a second. But I know I have ppl here who genuinely like me. So I'm gonna see what best I can do now. But push comes to shove, I'll deactivate it. Apologising to my 'genuine' followers in advance," she wrote.However, Suchitra seems to know who the culprit is. "Verified info: apparently Mr Hacker thinks - by including a picture of himself in the leaked pix, he won't invite suspicion on himself," one of her tweets read.
