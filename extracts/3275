Cut penis myself as it was of no use: Swami accused of rape.
A 54-year-old swami in Kerala whose penis was cut off by a 22-year-old law student has now claimed that it was he himself "who chopped off his sexual organ" as it was "not useful" for him.The sanyasi's comments are from the statement he gave Kerala Police after being charged under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POSCO) Act for repeatedly raping the now 22-year-old woman over a period of seven years. According to the police, the swami is a resident of the Padmana Chattambi Swami Ashram, which he joined 15 years ago after deciding to become a spiritual guru.
