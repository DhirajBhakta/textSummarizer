Crocodiles halt Goa bridge collapse rescue operations.
The search and rescue operation launched after an old bridge collapsed in South Goa on Thursday evening has been affected by the presence of crocodiles in the river. Bodies of two people have been recovered so far and several are still missing as divers are finding it difficult to go deep into the Sanvordem river due to fear of crocodiles in the water. Search operations resumed today morning to locate missing people who fell into the river after the dilapidated Portuguese-era bridge across the river Sanvordem collapsed. Dozens had gathered on the bridge to watch a man trying to commit suicide.Two bodies were recovered so far while about 20 swam to safety. A few others are still said to be missing. "The rescue operation began at 7.30 am today and efforts are on to check whether there are any more bodies in the water," Superintendent of Police (South) Shekhar Prabhudesai told PTI."The search operation was called off around midnight yesterday due to poor visibility. The divers from Indian Navy and a private agency which mans Goa's beaches, have been pressed into service to search for the bodies," he said.A spokesman of the Indian Navy today said the collapsed part of the bridge was removed last night. "Diving was stopped at around 3.30 am on the request of the collector. The diving operation has resumed this morning."He said since crocodiles are known to be present in the river water, precautions are being taken for the safety of the divers."As per local inputs, there may be two more persons missing. A helicopter sortie is being undertaken along the river for aerial search," he said.
