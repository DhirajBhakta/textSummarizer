The 26-year-old Chahal plays for Royal Challengers Bangalore in the IPL."Chahal is also a Royal Challengers Bangalore bowler. So, he knows this surface as much as anybody else does. T20 cricket has been a product of the IPL and Chahal has been a product of the IPL. He has got better and better by bowling in the IPL. He knows exactly what to do. It's a terrific effort. IPL has had great effects on India's T20 side and you have seen a lot of players come out of that format and do well for India," Ganguly to India Today.'INDIA WERE OUTSTANDING'
