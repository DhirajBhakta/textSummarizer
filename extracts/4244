ShopClues board backs Co-founders Radhika Aggarwal and Sethi.
New Delhi, Mar 14 (PTI) ShopClues board today come out in support of co-founders Radhika Aggarwal and Sanjay Sethi, saying the e-commerce marketplace has made "fantastic progress" under them. The statement comes days after another co-founder Sandeep Aggarwal charged the duo of downplaying his role in creation of the online marketplace. "We are proud of the fantastic progress made by the ShopClues team under Radhika and Sanjays leadership. It is very disappointing to see an ex-founder, who disassociated from the company for his (alleged) criminal wrongdoings, is now engaged in a personal vendetta on a public forum," said a statement issued on behalf of ShopClues board. On Sunday, Sandeep made several allegations against his estranged wife Radhika in a series of Facebook posts. Radhika, who is currently the chief business officer at ShopClues, said she is shocked by the unfounded and baseless allegations. ShopClues board said the companys goal is to create value for all stakeholders. "We remain focused on working closely with Radhika and Sanjay and the management team to continue to scale the company as it captures the massive opportunity which lies ahead of us," it added.
