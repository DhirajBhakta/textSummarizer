Every dog has his day, Vivian Richards tells BCCI.
The International Cricket Council (ICC) will be sitting this month, over the contentious issue of revenue sharing.One way or the other the decision coming out of the ICC boardroom will reflect on the influence the richest cricket board BCCI wields in decision making. The Indian cricket board (BCCI) contends it stands to lose as many as 330$ upwards in the revised distribution model for 2015-23 period passed at the last ICC meet. BCCI is fighting tooth and nail to preserve their supremacy in ICC money matters resulting out of the Big three formula' that was passed in 2014 which guaranteed them 21 percent upwards of total revenue. While the BCCI argues they are only asking what they deserve because cricket commerce revolves around Indian cricket, these claims are rubbished by one of the game's greatest name Sir Vivian Richards.

"That's rubbish in my opinion. You have to remember that it's a small pool when it comes to international cricket as opposed to soccer which is huge when it comes to revenue matters. One has to remember that. I say it because we as West Indies during our hay day made a lot of teams make money as well by going to tour places," he said.

"We (West Indies) may not be in the best position of late but at the end of the day we have made our fair contribution to what's happening at present as far as world cricket is concerned. So let's not forget these things," he added.
