Delhi man strangles wife to death over suspected affair.
Suspecting her of having an affair, a 37-year-old man allegedly strangled his wife to death after the two had an argument over the issue. The incident was reported from south east Delhi?s Kotla Mubarakpur area on Friday morning.Shabnam reportedly had a fight with her husband Taiyab a night before as well. The murder was discovered after their landlord Anil Kumar came to meet Taiyab and found the door ajar. When he went inside to check if Taiyab was around, he saw Shabnam lying dead on her bed. He then made a PCR call and informed the police.?We received a call from a neighbour who told us that a man had murdered his wife. The police team reached the spot and rushed her to the hospital where she was declared brought dead. The woman had strangulation marks on her neck and some bruises on the face that suggests that she was thrashed before she was killed. We have sent her body for a post-mortem examination,? a senior police officer said.The neighbours told the police that the couple often fought over the issue. While Taiyab suspected her of having an extra marital affair, Shabnam denied being involved in a relationship outside marriage. Shabnam had reportedly even confided in a neighbour about Taiyab thrashing her. ?Taiyab had gone to Saudi Arabia and returned a few months ago. He suspected that while he was out of India, his wife had an affair. He allegedly even checked her phone and always kept a watch on her which often led to arguments between the two,? a police officer said.On Friday morning the couple again had a fight after their kids went to school, following which Taiyab allegedly strangled his wife, left her body on the bed and fled the spot. He even picked up his children from their school and took them along, police said.?We have registered a case of murder in the matter and have sent out teams to arrest Taiyab. Teams have also been sent to his village in UP for raids,? a senior police officer said.
