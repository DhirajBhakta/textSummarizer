Celebrate Indian success stories like Dhirubhai Ambani: Pai.
New Delhi, Feb 21 (PTI) India needs to "celebrate" success stories of "heroes" like Dhirubhai Ambani and NR Narayana Murthy who have created wealth for the country and jobs for millions, former Infosys executive TV Mohandas Pai said today. "We have to create a good narrative for India. Our narrative is broken up into very negative matters about this country," he said. There are success stories across sectors such as pharmaceuticals, IT and telecom, he said, pointing out that of the top 10 software companies globally, five are Indian. "Why cant we celebrate that Mukesh Ambani wants to build a mature industry on empowering Indians to connect them to web at very low costs. There are so many success stories in India," Pai said addressing an AIMA event. Building a case for compassionate capitalism, he said, "We need to celebrate success of Indian businessmen like NR Narayana Murthy and Dhirubhai Ambani. "We need to learn what makes India work. We need more Indian case studies. Why cant an Ambani, Murthy get a Bharat Ratna? Why cant we honour businessmen? These people build the wealth for India, created jobs for India. I think it is important that we recognise the right kind of heroes."
