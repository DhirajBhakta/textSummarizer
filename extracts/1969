DTC bus fares slashed by up to 75% to reduce pollution.
Travel by bus is all set to get cheaper as the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government in Delhi is offering discount of up to 75% in order to encourage more people use public transport and leave their personal vehicles at home. For the whole of January, there will be a flat fare of Rs 5 in non-AC DTC and cluster buses  and Rs 10 for air-conditioned buses.Right now, a ride in a non-AC bus can cost anywhere between Rs 5 and Rs 15. The AC buses charge fares between Rs 10 and Rs 25.The government has decided to give free travel passes to students (below the age of 21), widows and senior citizens. It is also offering a permanent discount of 75% on travel passes to women  and those belonging to the economically weaker section. They can get a monthly pass for Rs 250, which currently costs Rs 800 for non-AC buses and Rs 1,000 for AC buses.  Our  aim is to reduce the number of vehicles on road, which will reduce pollution. Buses are anyway running empty and by lowering the fare, we are expecting more people to use the bus service. We are targeting youngsters and if they leave their bikes home and take the bus, then pollution will be reduced to a certain extent, said a senior transport department official.As per the data, 21.80% Delhi  commuters travel by bus but share of buses among all registered vehicles in Delhi has gone down from 1.52% in 1980-81 to 0.36% in 2014-15. However, during the same period, the share of private vehicles (two and four wheelers) increased from 86.61 % in 1980-81 to 95.95% in 2014-15.DTCfares for the different segments.
