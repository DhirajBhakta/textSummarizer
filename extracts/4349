Karan Johar will be an excellent father: Tusshar Kapoor.
It was only last year that Tusshar Kapoor became a single parent through surrogacy. The 40-year-old actor welcomed his bundle of joy, Laksshya and since then he has been busy being a hands-on daddy. And the actor is extremely happy for filmmaker Karan Johar who has joined the bandwagon of Bollywood's single parents. KJo recently became a dad to twins, a boy and girl, through surrogacy. In an interview to Times of India, Tusshar talked about the happiness that he shares with Karan.  "I'm very happy for him. I know what he must be feeling right now. Doubly so. It's a different kind of happiness. It fills you with confidence. Being a single parent teaches you time management and in a matter of minutes, you become so selfless because your energies are suddenly not for you, they're for your child. Karan's babies are about a month old. It's the most overwhelming feeling to have your children around you," he told the daily. On March 5, Karan issued an official statement announcing the big news and said that he is in a happy state. He added that he is blessed to be a parent to twins. When asked if he has any advice for B-Town newest daddy, Tusshar said, "He's the best multi-tasker I know. He doesn't need advice actually. He juggles so many things at once. And Karan will be an excellent father. He's a terrific son and a great pal. He's loving; he's a giver and a complete family man, which is evident even in his movies. He cherishes and values relationships. After the relationship with his parents, this will be the closest to his heart."He added, "The only thing I can tell him out of my experience is that he should go with the flow. There are no formulas for being a father. Trust your paternal instincts. They'll never misguide you."ALSO READ: This is what close friend SRK has to say on Karan Johar becoming a dad
