Delhi government to auction VIP numbers for two-wheelers.
 Those who had been wishing for a fancy number plate for their two-wheelers will soon have an opportunity to make their dream come true as the Delhi government is planning to e-auction special registration numbers for motorcycles and scooters. The minimum price for the golden number 0001 has been proposed at Rs 50,000, while bidding for numbers from 0002 to 0009 will begin from Rs 30,000.Last month, the department had sold the hottest number 0001 for a whopping Rs 16 lakh. Auctions like these bring a windfall to the governments exchequer and gratifies peoples desire for special digits on number plates  from date of birth to astrological and numerological numbers that are believed to bring prosperity.Gauging the high demand for numbers like 0786, 1111, 9999, 7777 and 1000, the transport department has set a base price of Rs 20,000 for them. While all these premium numbers will be issued only through e-auctions, another category of numbers like 0100, 2222, 8888, 6666 and so on will be sold for Rs 15,000 on first-come-first-serve basis. Any other registration number an individual would want will cost Rs 5,000..cashing_wrap {width:50%; border:dashed 1px #999; padding:10px; font-family:"Open Sans"; float:left; margin-right:12px}.cashing_headline {width:auto; margin-bottom:5px; font-size:150%; font-weight:bold; font-family:"PT Serif";}.cashing_line {width:auto; border:dotted 1px #999; margin-bottom:3px; margin-top:3px}.cashing_space {width:auto; margin:6px}.cashing_point ul {width:auto; list-style:url(http://www.hindustantimes.com/static/ht2016/10/bulletbrown1.png); margin:10px; padding-left:11px}.clrboth {clear:both; margin:5px}@media only screen and (max-width:400px) {.cashing_wrap {width:auto; border:dashed 1px #999; padding:10px; font-family:"Open Sans"; float:left; margin-right:0px}}Cashing in on number crazeGovt has now proposed rates of fancy numbers for bikes Bike owners demand fancy numbers, say officials. (HT FILE)The move assumes significance as the VIP numbers from 0001 to 0100 are currently available only for four-wheelers. This is despite the fact that two-wheelers are more than double (over 64 lakh) in number in Delhi compared to cars (over 30 lakh).Just like in cars, there is a huge demand for fancy numbers among owners of motorcycles and scooters. There is so much craze that almost every other day, owners of high-end bikes come to us asking for VIP numbers, but our Motor Licensing Officer (MLO) has no option but to turn them down, an official said.The entire process of getting registration numbers for two-wheelers, including payments, is going to be made online. At present, the system is manual, where the service is available only at the Mall Road licensing office.For nearly two years, the government had stopped issuing numbers from 0001 to 0100 to two-wheelers as this proposal was being prepared. The proposal is ready and has been sent to the law department. Once it is cleared by the chief minister, it will be sent to the lieutenant governor for his approval. If all goes well, then the first e-auction would be done by August end or September, the official said.For four-wheelers, the base auction price for the number 0001 is Rs 5 lakh, while those from 0002 to 0009 start at Rs 3 lakh. In the third category, bidding for numbers such as 0786, which is popular among Muslims as a talisman, start at Rs 2 lakh.
