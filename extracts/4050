Even Kapil misbehaved on flight but no ban on him: Sena MP.
For Shiv Sena, the act of one of its MPs thrashing a 60-year-old Air India employee with a slipper is not as big an incident as it is being projected. The party has come out in full defence of Osmanabad MP Ravindra Gaikwad.Speaking in Lok Sabha, Shiv Sena MP from Amravati Anandrao Adsul compared Gaikwad's act withan in-flight incident involving TV show host Kapil Sharma."Even Kapil Sharma misbehaved on flight after getting drunk but no ban imposed on him," Adsul said raising the issue of airlines refusing to fly Gaikwad following the last week's incident.AVIATION MINISTER RESPONDS"Rules are the same for everyone. We have good safety regulations but never in my dreams expected a Parliament member to be involved in such an incident," Civil Aviation Minister Ashok Gajapati Raju said in response to Adsul's remark. "Violence of any kind can be a disaster for airlines," Raju said. GAIKWAD GOES INTO HIDING, SAYS WILL APPEAR IN PARLIAMENT ON WEDNESDAYThreatening legal action against Air India, a defiant Gaikwad said he would take legal action against Air India for refusing to fly him. The national carrier had on last Friday cancelled his return ticket from Delhi to Pune. "A senior Sena leader ordered me not to speak with media till Wednesday (March 29) and so I am not coming before the media. I will come to Omerga on Tuesday and celebrate Marathi new year Gudi Padwa with my family and Shiv Sainiks. I will then attend Lok Sabha session (in New Delhi) on Wednesday," Gaikwad said.The Osmanabad MP, however, refused to reveal his whereabouts.Exclusive: Defiant Shiv Sena MP Ravindra Gaikwad dares Air India to blacklist himALSO READ: Shiv Sena backs Ravindra Gaikwad, calls bandh in support of MP in Osmanabad
