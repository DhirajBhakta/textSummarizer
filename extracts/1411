2017. Serena and Venus Williams in the womens final, Roger Federer in the mens with Rafael Nadal joining him if he beats Grigor Dimitov tomorrow. The veterans are dominating this Australian Open, although Dimitrov is playing well enough to pour cold water on all this romantic nostalgia. Ill have coverage of Nadal v Dimitrov tomorrow, but thats all from me for now. Thanks for reading and emailing. Bye.Updated

Federer is asked about the possibility of meeting Rafael Nadal in the final for the first time in six years. Its real now. I can actually talking about playing a finals for the first time. Ive been dodging that bullet for the last couple of days. But this is the last one. Ill leave it all out here in Australia and if I cant walk for another five months, thats ok. Rafa is the biggest challenge. This court allows me to be offensive. Im probably his number one fan. Weve had some epic battles over the years. It would be unreal to play here. I dont think both of us though we were going to be here potentially playing in the final because I went to open his academy in Mallorca with him a few months back and I told him I wish we could do a charity match or something, but I was on one leg and he had the wrist injury and we were playing some mini tennis with some juniors and we were like its the best we can do right now. A few months later, we are maybe going to be in the finals. Its a very special tournament for us already.

Federer is asked about the possibility of playing Grigor Dimitrov in the final. Hes got a very complete game. He can mix it up very well. Its either going to be him ... or Rafa. Talking about Grigor, I like his game. A lot of players come out and watch him. I didnt think he was going to be this consistent in this tournament.

More from Federer. I did feel he gave a bit of a cheap break. I didnt really deserve it at that moment. But I served it out. Everything happened so quickly at the end. I had to check the scoreboard. I never, ever in my wildest dreams thought I would come this far in Australia. Ive got a couple of days off. Im so happy.

Roger Federer speaks. Thank God. I thought he relaxed and I couldnt serve as well I did. He let it go and it worked for him. It was hard to stop the bleeding and I was playing tight. Stan was playing nothing to lose. It was very tricky. Good tennis in the fifth. Ive had a leg thing going on for the week and I felt it from the second game. I dont know. I dont really take injury timeouts, but Stan already took his so I thought people wont be mad and Stan wont be mad. That physio, he has magic hands. If you go off the court, that means the treatment is ... further ... up ... the ... leg.

Stan Wawrinka leaves to a huge ovation from an appreciative crowd. What an effort it was from the world No4, who was in tears at the end of the second set. What heart he showed to fight back when he returned from a medical timeout with tape on his right knee. But there was no denying Federer in the end.

Federer makes a perfect start, a low forehand into the left corner forcing Wawrinka to hoist a backhand wide. Then he runs around a forehand, drilling it down the line to force an anguished Wawrinka to net his forehand for 30-0. Another big forehand is enough to make Wawrinka hit wide again and Federer has three match points. He misses a first serve. He sends the second to Wawrinkas backhand and the world No4 sends his return long! Thats it! After missing most of last year with a knee injury Roger Federer has reached the Australian Open final at the age of 35! He embraces his vanquished opponent and close friend at the net before accepting the adulation from the crowd.Updated

Its advantage Federer after he dominates the net and he does enough with a volley to force a sliding Wawrinka, who almost does the splits, to net a forehand. A vital hold.

Fifth set: Federer* 7-5, 6-3, 1-6, 4-6, 2-1 Wawrinka (*denotes server): An ace down the middle from Federer is a fine way to start the game. He cant put away two smashes during the next rally and loses it when he nets a volley, before serving well for 30-15. The camera picks out Mirka, his wife, in mid-prayer. Does she know something we dont Wawrinka makes it 30-all with a superb return and then defends well, earning a break point when Federer nets a tentative backhand. Wawrinka has a look at a second serve and his return is outstanding. Federer hangs in there and its his turn to attack. Wawrinkas defence is also good. Federer tries a drop shot. Its not great, but Wawrinka pokes his backhand wide at the net and Federer goes on to hold. That could be huge. Federer breathes an almighty sigh of relief.

If StanTheMan manages to come back to win and go on to won the tournament does that mean that hes a greater player than our beloved Sir Andy says Jordan Spooner. Yes  Andy is more consistent but Stan would have 4 majors compared to Andys 3. Personally I would be happy to have an extra major than be called consistent. Oh yes  Andy, Stan and me are on first name terms!I can see where youre coming from, though Murray also has two Olympic titles and is the world No1. You can spin it either way. One thing: the form hes been in, I doubt Murrays going to stay on three majors.

Federer responds with a peach of a backhand pass from left to right for 15-all, which should make him feel a bit better about the way this has gone in the past 30 minutes. The game goes to 30-all and a baseline rally ensues. It ends with Wawrinka sending a backhand long and Federer has a break point. A brutally strong forehand from Wawrinka forces an error from Federer, whose forehand goes long for deuce. A double-fault from Wawrinka gifts Federer a second chance, though. Heres another long rally. Federers in control, though, and theres a hint of desperation about Wawrinkas final shot, a backhand that drifts long. Federer breaks to stop the rot.

Fourth set: Federer* 7-5, 6-3, 1-6, 0-1 Wawrinka (*denotes server): Federer looks completely confused, a double-fault making it 15-30.

With nothing to lose, hes just come back out and spanked the fuzz off the ball. He earns a break point when Federer sends a forehand wide. Federer serves wide and moves forward; Wawrinka just wallops a backhand pass from left to right to seal a third successive break. Federer has lost from two sets up on four occasions. Hes in serious peril of it happening for a fifth time now.

That medical timeout seems to have affected Federer more than Wawrinka, who takes a 30-0 lead with an ace out wide. Another storming backhand from Wawrinka brings up three set points and Federer nets a backhand. A horrible, unfocused third set from Federer and the 2014 champion is right back in this! Against all the odds, were heading into a fourth set!Updated
