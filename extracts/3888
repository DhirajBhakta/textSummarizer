Superwoman tweets to Sushma Swaraj to slam visa delay.
Popular YouTuber Lilly Singh was due to visit India later this month. But now the chances seem stalled.The Superwoman has reportedly been facing difficulties in acquiring her Indian visa. So she took to Twitter to vent her grievances against what she called a 'disappointment'.Now that every other individual in distress is making it a point to reach out to Sushma Swaraj, Lilly too followed the same, directing a series of tweets at the foreign minister and Prime Minister, Narendra Modi.Love india but gotta say that the consulate of India in Toronto is literally the worst place on earth. Such a disappointment.For travel to India, the consulate makes acquiring a visa the most difficult task. I hope one day @narendramodi can remedy this. It's sad..@SushmaSwaraj just a kind note to make you aware that the Consulate of India in Toronto is extremely difficult and unprofessional. ð???ð??½With more documentation than ever before, I received a lesser visa than before without any explanation. But again, I'll send an email. Thx https://t.co/NOnWKhNeWv Lilly also shot a video where she goes on at length about her trails at the consulate, describing the staff as 'rude and unprofessional' who yelled at her for even asking a question. Being a frequent visitor to India, she had applied for a one year visa but was only granted one for three months.
