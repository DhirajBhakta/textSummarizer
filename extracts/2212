						Various superheroes in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) like Captain America (Chris Evans), Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr), Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and Spider-Man (Tom Holland) have had their standalone film series. However, Ruffalo said at Disneys D23 Expo on Saturday that Universal Studios has the rights for Hulk, so, there are less chances for a standalone movie for the superhero. I want to just make one thing perfectly clear today: A standalone Hulk movie will never happen. Universal has the rights, and for some reason, they dont know how to play well with Marvel. And, they dont want to make money, Ruffalo told variety.com.Universal Pictures has maintained the rights to the Hulk ever since 2003 film Hulk starring Eric Bana and 2007 movie The Incredible Hulk with Edward Norton playing the lead role.Follow @htshowbiz for more
