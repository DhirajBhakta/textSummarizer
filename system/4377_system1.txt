The Shiv Sena has ended the suspense over who its candidates for Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) mayor and deputy mayor posts will be.The party declared Vishwanath Mahadeshwar and Hamangi Waralikar its candidates for the mayor and deputy mayor's posts respectively.This is third term of Mahadeshwar. 
This meeting was chaired by party chief Uddhav Thackeray who inquired about these two candidates from senior leaders and then confirmed their names.Now it's clear that the BMC mayor will be from the Shiv Sena as BJP has decided not to contest for the mayor's post and respect the BMC election mandate given by Mumbaikars.
