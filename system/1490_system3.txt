Yuvraj roared back to form and announced his comeback to international cricket with a blazing 150 off 127 balls which helped India win the second ODI by 15 runs and take an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match series. 
(Yuvraj Singh, MS Dhoni hundreds give India series win over England)England then rode on captain Eoin Morgan's 81-ball 102 to get close to the target but fell agonisingly short thanks to some intelligent bowling by Ravichandran Ashwin (3/65) and Jasprit Bumrah (2/81) in the death overs. 
(Vintage Yuvraj Singh is back with a bang)What an amazing partnership between a superstar and a rockstar!!
