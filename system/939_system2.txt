Poll-bound Gujarat has joined the likes of Tamil Nadu,Odisha and Rajasthan  by coming out with its own version of canteens for  providing  meals to the poor at a highly subsidised rate.Under the Shamik Annapurna Yojna launched on Tuesday, labourers will be provided a meal per day at Rs 10. 
Subsidised meal schemes have been introduced in other states since then, including Odisha where chief minister Naveen Patnaiks Aahar canteens have also been a big hit.
