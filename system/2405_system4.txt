The actor is apparently fed up of fans coming to her with the phone cameras in selfie mode. 
This trend of taking selfies is really extreme. 
I wish people were more keen to talk to you, instead of taking a selfie. 
says Kalki, who was last seen in actor Konkona Sen Sharma?
However, when it comes to socially relevant topics, Kalki feels that it?
We need advertisers, magazines, TV channels, even our newspapers to speak up. 
s easy for people to wait for actors to make the change. 
It has to be a collective decision, which needs to come from everyone. 
We still feel that they need to have a certain age and body type.?
