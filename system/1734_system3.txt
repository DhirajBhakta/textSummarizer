After Uber CEO Travis Kalanick recently said that India would be the last place to get the company's automated cars, now Google CEO Sundar Pichai has also said something on similar lines. 
However, despite all the progress made in this field, big challenges remain especially in countries like India, where the roads are not well-planned and the traffic is very chaotic.The India-born Google CEO also reaffirmed Google's commitment to digitally empower small and medium businesses in India. 
Digital Unlocked is a training program to empower thousands of Indian SMBs with essential digital skills that will enable them to get online and start using the power of the internet to grow their business while My Business Websites will help businesses to have a rich, mobile optimised digital presence that will be launched later this year.
