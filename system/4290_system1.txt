The remarkably well preserved eggs give an insight into the "mother croc" that laid them, researchers said. 
"The fact that they are from the Late Jurassic makes these eggs the oldest crocodilian eggs known so far," said Joao Russo of Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Portugal. 
"This new discovery from Portugal extends the knowledge of this type of egg by approximately 40 million years," said Russo.
