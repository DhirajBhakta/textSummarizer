The mask, that dates back to about 1000 BC, was found at a site where adults and children were buried. 
Scientists from University of Buenos Aires in Argentina also found a source of copper ore within 70 kilometres of the location where the mask was uncovered, suggesting that it was produced locally. 
The metal mask - along with a collection of human bones  was found in a tomb near a village in northwestern Argentina.
