A former Chinese diplomat, who was earlier Consul General in Mumbai, told Chinese state media on Wednesday that Indian troops faced three options at Doklam as the stand-off entered one month: withdrawal, capture or an attack by China "should the dispute escalate".His comments underline the sharpening rhetoric from Beijing - and the threat of use of force - over the stand-off, with the Chinese government still insisting that there was no room for diplomatic solutions until India fulfilled a "precondition" of withdrawing unilaterally.Liu Youfa, former Chinese Consul General in Mumbai and now a strategic affairs expert, told state broadcaster China Central Television's English-language channel on Wednesday, "When people in uniform get across the border and move into territory of another country, they naturally become the enemies who have to face three consequences."
