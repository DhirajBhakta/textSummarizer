New Delhi, Jan 2 (PTI) The Supreme Court today questioned the Centre as why judges and chief justices of high courts are not being transfered despite the recommendations of the collegium and asked it to file a status report on such pending transfers with detailed reasons in two weeks. 
The apex court said it gives rise to "speculation and misgivings" due to continuance of such judges in the same high court and instead of sitting over the recommendation, the Centre should return back to the collegium for reconsideration. 
The AG said that the collegium has sent back 37 names of judges to the government which is looking at them. 
Rohatgi said he needs to take instructions on the pending recommendations of transfers and sought three weeks of time. 
I will come back in three weeks with full details," Rohatgi said.
