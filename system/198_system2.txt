The latest being actor Bhumi Pednekar, who has a host of good things to say about Akshay with whom she recently worked in Toilet: Ek Prem Katha.Sir (Akshay) is so focused and professional. 
He completely dedicates himself during the filming process. 
He is a great example to have for newcomers like us. 
On set, he is filled with excitement and is so well-behaved. 
Akshay sir is absolutely different from that. 
When you see Akshay sir, it all comes crashing down. 
He is so down-to-earth and is always punctual on set. 
Professionally, I wish I could adopt those habits from him.     
The best love stories have known the greatest pain. 
I said yes to the film because of the script. 
I didnt know about Akshay sir being a part of it then. 
It is one of those rare films that is an out-and-out romance. 
Its a very credible film with a social message, so I knew I am not letting it go, says a proud Bhumi. 
Asked if she thinks that the film will actually turn the spotlight on to the problem of open defecation, she adds. 
It will be an eye-opener. 
As responsible citizens we must all work towards making a better society. 
We cant have the ostrich mentality and look away from issues and think things are fine. 
We all need to work towards it, she says.
