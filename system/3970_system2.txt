Mumbai, Apr 2 (PTI) Banker Uday Kotak feels there will be strong consolidation in the financial services sector and eventually only five players will dominate the space just like in the global space. 
When asked about the names of banks which will dominate the domestic banking space, Kotak declined to specify the names but said State Bank of India will be one among them. 
Kotak also made a strong pitch for having norms on "bank mortality", underlining that not all the players who enter due to liberal rules cant make it commercially, and should thus be given exit options. 
When asked about if e-wallets will succeed, Kotak said, "to some of those models, you need to ask the question- how will you get stickiness and ultimately monetise" Advocating a faster push on growth, Kotak said he is getting the vibes of an uptick in growth.
