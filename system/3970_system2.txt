Mumbai, Apr 2 (PTI) Banker Uday Kotak feels there will be strong consolidation in the financial services sector and eventually only five players will dominate the space just like in the global space. 
When asked about the names of banks which will dominate the domestic banking space, Kotak declined to specify the names but said State Bank of India will be one among them. 
As you make entry easier, mortality always have to be thought about," Kotak said. 
When asked about if e-wallets will succeed, Kotak said, "to some of those models, you need to ask the question- how will you get stickiness and ultimately monetise?" 
Advocating a faster push on growth, Kotak said he is getting the vibes of an uptick in growth. 
When pointed to the continuing reluctance of private sector to invest since the past three years now, Kotak said, "we need to be bold and get the animal spirits back.
