The observation came from Justice J R Midha who also said that the "working in the temple has to improve. 
This is not the way. 
I am concerned whether a temple should be run in this way". 
"There is only a fraction of a second for a person to view the deity. 
Within that fraction of a second, there should be no obstruction between devotees and God. 
Here (the temple) the fraction of a second is not unobstructed. 
I also go to that temple. 
"People (the priests) are there only to obstruct. 
Give a person one or two seconds to communicate with God.
