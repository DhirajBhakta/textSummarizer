Tej Bahadur Yadav, the BSF jawan who was dismissed from duty for uploading a video on the 'substandard food' served to soldiers, today attended a Mumbai event honouring martyrs. 
Mumbai Congress Chief Sanjay Nirupam had called on Yadav to preside over the function as a guest. 
The process is on and my lawyers are working on it."'80 PER CENT OFFICERS CORRUPT'He added that if he loses the appeal against his dismissal, then he will knock the court's doors.
