If Salman Khan indulged in some daredevil stunts in the 2012 film Ek Tha Tiger, Katrina Kaif is set to give him some serious competition in the sequel.

Given Struthers shot for certain action sequences for Christopher Nolan's Batman films including the Dark Knight Rises, expect the absolute best from these scenes.
