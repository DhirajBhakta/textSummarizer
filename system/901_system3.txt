 IndiGo revoked on Wednesday a ban on TDP parliamentarian JC Diwakar Reddy who manhandled the airlines staff at the Vishakhapatnam airport last month after being denied boarding for arriving late for a flight.The decision came after Reddy met officials from the airline in a meeting in New Delhi set up by Union minister for science and technology, YS Chowdary. 
The issue is amicably resolved between the two sides and IndiGo decided to lift the said ban with immediate effect, a statement from the airline said. 
Reddy has also agreed to withdraw the case he filed (against eight airlines which has banned Reddy from flying in domestic flights).On June 16, Reddy  the Anantapur Lok Sabha representative  misbehaved with IndiGo staff at the Vishakhapatnam airport when they refused to give him a boarding pass for his flight to Hyderabad since the gates had been closed. 
The lawmaker went on to shout at the airline employees, and surveillance footage showed him banging his hands on a printer and pushing an IndiGo staffer.

Shiv Sena MP Ravindra Gaikwad was also temporarily banned by airlines after he assaulted an Air India staffer, triggering a controversy that prompted the Union government to release proposed rules for a national no-fly list for unruly passengers. 
IndiGo appreciates and thanks the member airlines for their continued support, it said.Reddy had challenged the ban in court, and the case was scheduled to come up for hearing in Hyderabad high court on July 21.
