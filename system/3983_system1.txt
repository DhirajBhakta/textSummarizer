Addressing his first public meeting in North Delhis Burari area in the run up to the civic polls, Kejriwal said if his party wins MCD polls, it will not allow this to happen. 
Listing out the achievements of his dispensation, the AAP chief said his government has halved power tariff in the city and provided free water to Delhites, but the BJP and the Congress would not allow it to continue if they win the polls.
