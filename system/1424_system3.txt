"The canteen stores department (CSD) and the unit run canteens under it have been asked by the services to turn cashless from March 1 as they will sell goods only using plastic money," sources told Mail Today here. 
The CSD has almost 1.2 crore direct customers in form of serving and retired personnel along with their families and had a turnover of over Rs 13,000 crore last year. 
The local formations have issued advisories to the retired personnel that they should arrange credit or debit cards by March 1 as the canteens are turning cashless, the sources said.
