Maharashtra has become the first state to make social boycott a crime after President Pranab Mukherjee cleared the legislation. 
It aims to prevent atrocities carried out by extra-judicial courts and caste panchayats. 
The bill was cleared by the state legislature in April and was sent to the President for his approval. ?
The Act has been cleared by the Central government. 
The Act also has a provision to withdraw cases with the consent of victims and permission from a court. 
Hamid Dabholkar, activist of Maharashtra Andhshradha Nirmulan Samiti and son of slain anti-superstition crusader Narendra Dabholkar, said their three-and-a-half-year-old demand had been met. ?
