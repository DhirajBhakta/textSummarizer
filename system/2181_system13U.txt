That is how you take care of your children too, dont you said Sandeep.After his fathers death, Sandeep, his wife and his mother took up the initiative to plant 2,000 saplings in Aarey. 
The garden has 700 trees now with 70 nectar plant species, including Jamaican spike, lemon, jathropha, pentas, exoras and many other species. 
These are mostly plants that will attract the butterflies and help with their life cycle, he said, adding that his son Malhar has planted saplings all by himself and loves to be in the company of butterflies.Their efforts come at a time when Aarey is being besieged by several development projects.
