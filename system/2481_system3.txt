An Airbnb host who canceled a womans reservation using a racist remark has been ordered to pay $5,000 in damages for racial discrimination and take a course in Asian American studies.Dyne Suh, a 26-year-old law clerk, had booked Tami Barkers mountain cabin in Big Bear, California, for a skiing weekend with friends in February, but Barker canceled the reservation by text message minutes before they arrived,stating: I wouldnt rent it to u if u were the last person on earth and One word says it all. 
In addition to paying monetary damages and taking a college-level course in Asian American studies, Barker must agree to comply with anti-discrimination laws, make a personal apology to Suh, participate in a community education panel and volunteer with a civil rights organization.We were thinking pretty creatively with this agreement, said Kevin Kish, director of DFEH. 
Humans have biases and we also need to recognize that humans change.Barkers lawyer Edward Lee said in a statement that his client was regretful for her impetuous actions and comments but pleased to have resolved the matter with Suh and the DFEH in a manner that can hopefully bring a positive outcome out of an unfortunate incident.Airbnb allowed the DFEH to regulate it for racial bias following a 10-month investigation based on a growing number of reports suggesting hosts regularly refuse to rent to guests due to their race, a problem exposed in 2016 under the hashtag #AirbnbWhileBlack.Until that point, Airbnb, like other sharing economy companies including Uber and Instacart, had repeatedly resisted industry regulations, arguing that it was a platform and not subject to local laws and requirements that apply to similar businesses.
