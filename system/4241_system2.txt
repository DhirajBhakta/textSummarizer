And after the Jaipur attack, Bhansali shifted base to Kolhapur in Maharashtra to resume the shooting of the film. 
But if reports are to be believed, the sets were once again attacked on Tuesday night, this time in Kolhapur. 
Bhansali shifted venue for security reasons, but it's sad to see that the set was attacked here too. 
The reason for the attack was that Bhansali was allegedly showing a romantic sequence between 14th century emperor Alauddin Khilji (played by Ranveer Singh) and Rani Padmini (played by Deepika Padukone), an incident which the Karni Sena claims had never happened in history and thus, filming the same would be an insult to the Rajputana pride.Interestingly, the filmmakers had never planned to have such a scene in the first place. 
Meanwhile, it is reported Bhansali is safe, but the shooting of the film has been stalled till further notice.
