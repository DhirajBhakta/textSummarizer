New Delhi, Jan 29 (PTI) Ace cricketer and former India captain M S Dhoni has alleged before Delhi High Court that a mobile firm was still using his name by projecting him as its brand ambassador despite termination of the agreement between them way back in December 2012. 
The High Court pulled up the top official of Maxx Mobilink Pvt Ltd after taking note of the plea of former captain that its orders have been defied by the firm. 
The court had also passed a similar order on April 21 last year asking Agarwal to inform about the steps taken to comply with the 2014 direction asking the firm to refrain from selling any product, claiming to be endorsed by Dhoni.
