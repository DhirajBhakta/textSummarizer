The Supreme Court's revival of the conspiracy charge against BJP veteran LK Advani in the Babri Masjid demolition case is itself a conspiracy of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to remove the BJP veteran from the Presidential race, Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) chief Lalu Prasad said today.
?"The CBI is in the hands of the Prime Minister, and the CBI today said in court that the case of conspiracy should take place against Advani in the Babri case. 
?Earlier today, the Supreme Court ruled Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi, Rajasthan Governor Kalyan Singh, Union Minister Uma Bharti, and others in the BJP and the Vishwa Hindu Parishad must face the conspiracy charge in the 1992 demolition case
