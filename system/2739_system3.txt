The incident took place at MGM Hospital in Warangal district on Sunday. 
As the parents were preparing for the baby's funeral, they observed some movement in the baby's body. 
They immediately rushed to the hospital for treatment. 
After a few hours of treatment, the baby was declared dead.Responding to the incident, the doctors said ECG machines were not working in the morning.Last month, a similar case of negligence took place at Delhi's Safdarjung hospital, when the maternity ward attendants at the hospital told 27-year-old Rohit Tandon that his wife Shanti had given birth to a stillborn baby.The doctor and the nursing staff sealed the body in a packet, labelled it and gave it to the father. 
The institute said that the medical procedure was actually an "abortion" and not a "delivery", as the mother was 20 weeks pregnant and the foetus weighed 460 grams.
