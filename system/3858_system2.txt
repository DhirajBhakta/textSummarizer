AAP found ammunition to gun for the BJP on Monday after it emerged that the saffron party's Inderpuri candidate for this month's municipal polls, who was touted as a slum dweller and the face of the city's urban poor, happens to be a millionaire. 
She disclosed that she owns two residential properties measuring 720 square feet and 553 square feet at Dasghara in Inderpuri whose market price is pegged at Rs 50 lakh and Rs 32 lakh, respectively.
