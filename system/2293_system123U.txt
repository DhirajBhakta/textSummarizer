The decision comes after the Noida authoritys traffic cell found out that 80% of road markings in the city are either washed away or fade out on their own. 
Once the road and lane marks are in place, they will help the traffic police in regulating the flow of traffic, Sandip Chandra, head of the Noida authoritys traffic cell, said. 
The project involves marking of zebra crossings, left-right turns, stop lines for vehicles and designated spaces for pedestrians, who often face problems negotiating traffic without adequate markings on roads.
