A US gunship has killed at least 12 Afghan policemen in a friendly fire airstrike in Helmand, according to local officials.The incident is a setback for the US-Afghan fight against the Taliban in the embattled province, and comes as the US administration and its Nato allies are preparing the deployment of several thousand additional troops to Afghanistan.Since 2001, Helmand has consistently been the deadliest province for both foreign and Afghan forces. 
The attack occurred on Friday afternoon, when, according to local police sources, an Afghan police unit retook a checkpoint captured by the Taliban on Thursday. 
Due to apparent miscommunication, a US gunship bombed the police unit 30 minutes later, according to police sources.The spokesman to the provincial governor, Omar Zawak, said the number of killed and injured was not yet clear. 
The incident followed a week of intensified US airstrikes in Helmand. 
We can confirm local security personnel aligned with Afghan government forces were killed in an airstrike in Gereshk district in Helmand province late this afternoon.?
