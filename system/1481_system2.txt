Jaipur, Jan 20 (PTI) Actor Rishi Kapoor has revealed he was not ready to do a scene in his father Raj Kapoors "Shree 420" and it was a chocolate bribe by Nargis Dutt that convinced him to do it. 
During a session at the ongoing Jaipur Literature Festival (JLF), the 64-year-old actor, who has recently released his autobiography "Khullam Khula", said he was two when he accepted his first bribe. 
In that sense, I started taking bribes when I was two-year-old," Rishi said. 
"After the success of Bobby, expectation rose and it became difficult for me to compete with contemporary actors," he said. 
"It seems that it is easy for star sons to become a hit hero but after your first film you have to cross the journey alone. 
Talking about his family including his wife Neetu and son Ranbir, he said that he is in Jaipur ahead of 37th marriage anniversary which falls on January 22.
