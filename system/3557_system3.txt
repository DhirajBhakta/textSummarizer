The distributors, producers and filmmakers say they want to protect the interest of Pakistani movies as two big films, "Yalghaar" and "Shor Sharaba", along with others in the pipeline, are slated for an Eid release. 
"If Tubelight also releases on Eid, it will certainly hit the business of these Pakistani films and that will not help our industry," actor Mustafa Qureshi said. 
Sohail Khan, the producer of "Shor Sharaba", said, "My film is supposed to release on Eid-ul-Fitr and if the government doesnt stall Tubelight, I will not release it as a mark of protest." 
"It has been decided that all those related to the Pakistani film industry will support the Pakistani films that are supposed to release on Eid-ul-Fitr," Hussain added.
