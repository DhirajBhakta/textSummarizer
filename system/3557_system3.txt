Karachi, Apr 30 (PTI) Bollywood superstar Salman Khans much awaited film "Tubelight" might not hit the screens on Eid in Pakistan as some local filmmakers have started a movement to stall the release of the film. 
The filmmakers along with the Film Distributors Association and the Film Producers Association want to ensure better business for Pakistani films during the Eid holidays. 
"If required we can even go to the court," producer Altaf Hussain said. 
Hussain said the associations are planning to send an official letter to Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif as well. 
He confirmed a meeting was held in Lahore at which it was decided that the entire Pakistani film industry will join the planned protest to stop the release of "Tubelight" on Eid.
