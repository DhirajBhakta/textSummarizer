But even the 22-year-old did not expect what happened  a 0.47sec improvement on the world record of 26.42sec he set in winning the 50m title in Kazan, Russia in 2015.Peaty clocked 26.10 in the morning heat, 0.44 ahead of his nearest rival, and improved his mark to 25.95 in the evening semi-final, 0.73sec clear of the field.I didnt think I was going to do that, said Peaty, who shook his head in disbelief after seeing his time. 
I thought I was going to go slower [in the semi-final] because I was a little bit less energetic.Peaty has the five fastest times in history over 50m breaststroke, a non-Olympic event, and admitted a sub-26sec swim had not been on his radar, with his focus on what he calls Project 56  swimming beneath 57sec over 100m, since Rio.
