Just 100 companies have been the source of more than 70% of the worlds greenhouse gas emissions since 1988, according to a new report.The Carbon Majors Report (pdf) pinpoints how a relatively small set of fossil fuel producers may hold the key to systemic change on carbon emissions, says Pedro Faria, technical director at environmental non-profit CDP, which published the report in collaboration with the Climate Accountability Institute. 
This is likely to have catastrophic consequences including substantial species extinction and global food scarcity risks.While companies have a huge role to play in driving climate change, says Faria, the barrier is the absolute tension between short-term profitability and the urgent need to reduce emissions.A Carbon Tracker study in 2015 found that fossil fuel companies risked wasting more than $2tn over the coming decade by pursuing coal, oil and gas projects that could be worthless in the face of international action on climate change and advances in renewables  in turn posing substantial threats to investor returns.CDP says its aims with the carbon majors project are both to improve transparency among fossil fuel producers and to help investors understand the emissions associated with their fossil fuel holdings.
