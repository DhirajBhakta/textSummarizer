Pictures shared widely on social media showed the owner of the now-defunct Kingfisher Airlines sitting in the stands wearing a white coat. 
Notably, Mallya was once associated with the Indian Premier League as the owner of the Royal Challengers Bangalore team. 
In an another photo, also shared on social media, Mallya was seen along with Indian batting legend Sunil Gavaskar. 
India Today could not independently verify the photo, but the businessman was wearing the same attire seen in other photos shared from the match.
