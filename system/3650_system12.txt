London, Apr 24 (PTI) Oxford University students who avoid making eye contact with their peers could be guilty of racism, according to the prestigious varsitys latest guidance. 
It also claims that "jokes drawing attention to someones differences" and "not speaking directly to people" are potential forms of "everyday racism". 
Dr Joanna Williams, a lecturer in higher education at the University of Kent, said the guidance was "completely ridiculous" and will make students "hyper-sensitive" about how they interact with one another.
