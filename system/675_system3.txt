(Presidents speech: Full text)Mukherjee, the 13th President of India, will leave the Rashtrapati Bhawan on Tuesday when his successor Ram Nath Kovind is sworn in.I strived to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution, not just in word but also in spirit, Mukherjee said, reflecting upon his time as Indias titular head of state that began in 2012.The President has raised eyebrows last year when he ordered the dismissal of the Uttarakhand government.Mukherjee spent 37 years as a Congress member in Parliament, where, he said on Sunday, realised how disruption hurts the opposition more than the government as it denies them the opportunity to raise the concerns of the people, the President said.The monsoon session of Parliament currently underway has seen repeated adjournments, costing of time and money for the House. 
His comment assumes significance in the wake of the rise of smaller parties in Parliament.Mukherjee spoke about his association with PV Narsimha Rao, remember former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee for his oration, Manmohan Singh for his calming presence, and recalled how LK Advani gave him mature advice and Sonia Gandhi was a passionate supporter of social legislations.In the closing parts of his speech, he praised Prime Minister Modi and said: Ill carry with me fond memories of association with PM Narendra Modi and remember his warm behaviour towards me.
