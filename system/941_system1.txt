The Gurugram Police has arrested actor Bidisha Bezbaruah's husband a day after she was found dead under mysterious circumstances. 
The 30-year-old actor and singer, who was seen in the recently released film Jagga Jasoos with Ranbir Kapoor, allegedly committed suicide at her residence in the posh Sushant Lok area of the city. 
She had recently come from Mumbai to Gurgaon, the police said. 
"Bezbaruah was found hanging from a ceiling fan in her rented accommodation which she had taken recently," Deputy Commissioner of Police (East) Deepak Saharan said. 
"The victims father claimed in his complaint that she had a love marriage but would often have quarrels with her husband," Saharan said.
