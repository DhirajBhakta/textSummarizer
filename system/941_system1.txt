"Bezbaruah was found hanging from a ceiling fan in her rented accommodation which she had taken recently," Deputy Commissioner of Police (East) Deepak Saharan said. 
He said the father of the actress had informed the police that she was not taking his calls. 
The police team broke open the door and found her hanging, he said. 
"We are investigating the case and if required we will call her husband to record his statement," Saharan said.
