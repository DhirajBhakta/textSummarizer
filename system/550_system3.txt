A federal judge on Monday cleared the way for Donald Trumps commission on election fraud to resume collecting detailed voter roll information from the states.The commission asked states last month to provide publicly available data including registered voters names, birth dates and partial social security numbers, but it later told them to hold off until a judge ruled on a lawsuit filed by the Electronic Privacy Information Center (Epic) in Washington. 
The US district court judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly, in the District of Columbia, denied the advocacy groups request to block the data collection in a ruling that the commissions vice-chairman, Kris Kobach, called a major victory for government accountability, transparency and the publics right to know about the integrity of our elections processes.The commission requested this publicly available data as part of its fact-gathering process, which is information that states regularly release to political candidates, political parties and the general public, said Kobach, the Republican secretary of state in Kansas.
