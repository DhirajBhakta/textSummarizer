Thousands of Metro passengers were left stranded on Delhi Metro's blue line today following a technical snag which happened after a bird got electrocuted on the overhead electricity line.Officials said the bird sat on the wires and got electrocuted on the overhead wires leading to a short circuit.A Metro train plying on the Indraprastha metro station stopped and services on the blue line were affected for over three hours.The restoration work was later on completed and normal services on affected section resumed from 7:43 pm onwards.As trains ran on a single line between Indraprastha and Yamuna Bank stations for nearly three hours, crowd swelled across stations of the busy corridor that connects Noida City Centre and Vaishali to west Delhi's Dwarka.The incident happened around 4.55 pm, minutes before evening peak period, which sees thousands of home-bound commuters taking the rapid transit as office hours get over around this time.The over 50-km-long Blue Line, Delhi Metro Rail Corporation's (DMRC) longest corridor as of now, is extremely snag-prone due to a host of factors including its vulnerability to external factors as it is largely overground.DMRC's network currently spans around 213 km and it carries an average of 30 lakh passengers daily, with blue line being one of the busiest.Also read:
