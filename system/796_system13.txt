But things took a different turn when Sabbir Khan of Baaghi fame revealed that he will direct the third instalment of the popular franchise. 
The Baaghi director then took a U-turn and clarified the "rumours" and confirmed that he was never approached for the film.Contrary to rumours I haven't been approached for Dabbang 3 as far as I know @PDdancing is directing and my best to @arbaazSkhan
