With the release of Baahubali 2: The Conclusion a week away, Prabhas, 37, talks about the making of the Baahubali phenomenon, what his superhero status means to him and life after Baahubali exclusively to India Today.What was it like to play two different characters - Mahendra Baahubali and Amarendra Baahubali - both iconic and superheroes but with distinctly different personalities?
I knew that an epic film of this proportion would take this much time to be made. 
Part one focused more on introducing the characters, while part two is the resolution and offered greater scope for performance as well.Do you relate to the characters you played in Baahubali?
