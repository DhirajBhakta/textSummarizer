Calling him irresponsible, the actor said that Basu fails to complete films on time. 
They dont show their films before release to take opinions, and treat it as though theyre making a nuclear bomb. 
But who is going to give that opinion to them I totally agree with Ekta (Kapoor) when she threw him out from her film. 
Asked about why the film wasnt released in some international markets on time, Rishi Kapoor again blamed Basus delays.
