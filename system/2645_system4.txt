The pictures of the trains led to speculation that the two rakes came face-to-face and a head-on collision was averted but MMRDA authorities denied reports that two monorail trains nearly crashed. 
UPS Madan, MMRDA Chief said, "One Monorail rake lost power before it could reach the Chembur station, due to which we had to send another to rake to push it so that the rake could reach Chembur station. 
The rumours of collision or any rescue of passengers who got stuck are completely false".The Mumbai monorail, the first such service in the country, was inaugurated in 2014 and runs a 8.93-km-long route between Chembur and Wadala.Also Read:Uttar Pradesh: Satyagarh Express hits goods train near Sitapur, 5 people injured
