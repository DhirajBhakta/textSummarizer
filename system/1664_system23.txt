Lucknow, Jan 9 (PTI) A BJP leader has moved the Election Commission against BSP chief Mayawati accusing her of seeking votes in the name of caste and demanded that her party be debarred from contesting elections. 
BJPs UP executive member Neeraj Shankar Saxena moved a petition against Mayawati on Saturday demanding that her party be debarred from contesting polls and filing of FIR against her for "flouting" Supreme Court directives.
