There is finally good news coming in from Kashmir in the form of tourists visiting the Valley. 
According to the MHA sources, two-and-a-half lakh tourists visited the "paradise on earth" in the first quarter of this year. 
The figure is much lesser than that of the same period of 2016, which witnessed 3-and-a-half lakh tourists visiting the Valley. 
The Valley saw a massive slump in tourist arrival since the death of Hizbul Mujahideen Commander Burhan Wani in July last year.
