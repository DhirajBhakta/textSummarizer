In a bizarre list of prizes, the organisers handed out a cow, a goat, a duck as the first, second and third prize, and a number of hens and fishes as consolation prizes.Interestingly, even after the announcement of the list of prizes, people queued up in huge numbers to buy the lottery tickets.For the locals of Assam, lotteries like this are a common occurrence and happen in almost all the villages of the state.
