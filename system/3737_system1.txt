The Supreme Court's revival of the conspiracy charge against BJP veteran LK Advani in the Babri Masjid demolition case is itself a conspiracy of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to remove the BJP veteran from the Presidential race, Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) chief Lalu Prasad said today.
?"The CBI is in the hands of the Prime Minister, and the CBI today said in court that the case of conspiracy should take place against Advani in the Babri case. 
Anyone can understand that it is a political conspiracy of the Modi government to eliminate Advani from the race," Lalu said in Patna.
?The RJD chief further said the conspiracy against Advani has been hatched despite him supporting Narendra Modi in the aftermath of the 2002 Gujarat riots.
