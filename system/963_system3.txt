The list was ascertained after an offline and online draw was organised by the administration.However, according to the district basic education officer, MP Verma, many schools have not started the process of admitting underprivileged children under RTE.We have received complaints that many schools were demanding money for admission under RTE and that many were also denying admission. 
We have decided to take strict action against these schools and have given them a final warning asking them to enrol the kids as soon as possible, said Verma.The schools have been given a two-day window to initiate the admission process.
