The Real Madrid striker was joined on Wednesday by dozens of guests and hundreds of fans in his native Madeira Islands for an official ceremony renaming the local airport as Aeroporto Cristiano Ronaldo.Portugals president and the prime minister flew to the island and unveiled a commemorative plaque outside the terminal entrance, above a bust of Ronaldo.The 32-year-old Ronaldo is a local hero in Madeira, where he is seen as a rags-to-riches success. 
You know how proud I am of my roots, my homeland, Ronaldo, wearing a dark suit and tie, said in a speech.The four-time player of the year has made a record 138 national team appearances for Portugal and is the teams top scorer with 71 goals.The change was decided by the Madeira regional government after Portugal won the 2016 European Championship. 
However, President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa said the tribute was legitimate because it was decided by an elected government.Ronaldo, Rebelo de Sousa said in his speech, is an example of excellence and projects Madeira and Portugal across the world far more than anybody else.Ronaldo is not the first football player with his name on an airport.
