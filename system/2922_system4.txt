And this International Yoga Day, the 'monkey couple' took a detour from their usual fitness regime and turned 'yogi monkeys'. 
Bipasha took to Instagram to share a few pictures performing different asanas with hubby Karan and wrote, "Yoga is like Life - It's a beautiful balance of Holding On and Letting Go. 
Keep practicing , we are all work in progress.
