CISF handles airport security across the country.HT accessed the draft report that was taken up for adoption at the PAC meeting last week.The committee indicted the operators, Delhi International Airport Limited (DIAL) and the ministry of civil aviation for what it says was the unscientific commercial usage of the space available for passengers, especially restaurants, retail outlets, duty-free complexes and executive lounges. 
The Delhi International Airport Private Ltd (DIAL) is a joint venture consortium led by the GMR Group.A DIAL spokesperson said the airports terminals were well within global aviation standards in terms of the proportion of area given out to commercial setups with respect to the overall size of the terminal.
