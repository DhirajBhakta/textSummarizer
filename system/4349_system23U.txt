It was only last year that Tusshar Kapoor became a single parent through surrogacy. 
The 40-year-old actor welcomed his bundle of joy, Laksshya and since then he has been busy being a hands-on daddy. 
And the actor is extremely happy for filmmaker Karan Johar who has joined the bandwagon of Bollywood's single parents. 
He added that he is blessed to be a parent to twins.
