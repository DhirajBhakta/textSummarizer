Last week, proxy advisory firm Institutional Investor Advisory Services (IiAS) had red-flagged the proposal saying Raymonds promoters and their extended family are trying to buy the premium property in Mumbai from the company at throwaway rates which will result in loss of over Rs 650 crore to the company and its shareholders. "...As a related party I am required to abstain from voting on this resolution. 
However, my personal opinion would be to vote against the resolution in interest of the shareholders and company," Raymond Chairman and Managing Director Gautam Hari Singhania said in a statement. 
"Raymond is committed to protect shareholders interest..In the interest of all shareholders including minority shareholders, I would like to reinstate the fact that the company is taking all appropriate measures to safeguard the interests of stakeholders," he added. 
Raymond said the tripartite agreement was entered in 2007 between the company, lessor and occupants, all of whom were related parties, to offer apartments for sale at a substantial discount to the current prevailing market prices which would cause a major loss to the company and shareholders.
