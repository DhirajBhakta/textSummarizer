Congratulations to Akshay Kumar's Jolly LLB 2 for joining the list of films to have offended people in this country.Advocate Ajaykumar S Waghmare has filed a petition at the Bombay High Court, asking that the word 'LLB' should be deleted from the Jolly LLB 2, the title of Akshay Kumar's upcoming film.According to a report in The Hindu, advocate Waghmare has stated in his petition that using the word LLB is a "deliberate attempt to malign the reputation of the Indian legal profession."
Waghmare has also asked the court to stop Jolly LLB 2's trailer from being played on social media and TV channels.Jolly LLB 2 revolves around the story of lawyer Jagdish Mishra (Akshay Kumar) who locks horns with a rival lawyer played by National Award-winning actor Annu Kapoor in a high-profile case.
