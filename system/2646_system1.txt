(Eds: Updating with more quotes) By Barun Jha Hamburg, Jul 8 (PTI) Prime Minister Narendra Modi today pressed upon his British counterpart Theresa May to ensure UKs cooperation to bring back economic offenders, amidst India working hard for the return of fugitive liquor baron Vijay Mallya and former IPL chief Lalit Modi. 
Mallya has been in the UK for months, escaping arrest warrants against him, while a court in London is also hearing a case regarding his return to India. 
To a query on whether was Mallya in focus in terms of escaped economic offenders discussed with May, Baglay said, "We have put out a tweet and the term used there is a plural... its English language and people who know English should understand it".
