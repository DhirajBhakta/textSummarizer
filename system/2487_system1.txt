This is something he loved and theres no better feeling than getting a whale untangled, and I know how good he was feeling after cutting that whale clear.On Tuesday, the federal fisheries department confirmed that Howlett had been killed while on one of its vessels, describing him as an irreplaceable member of the whale rescue community.In a statement, the department offered its deepest sympathies to the family and friends of the father of two.
