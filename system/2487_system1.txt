A Canadian lobster fisherman who saved dozens of endangered whales after they became tangled in fishing nets has been killed ? 
s eastern coast on Monday to help rescue a north Atlantic right whale that had become heavily tangled in rope. 
The rescue was steeped in urgency: in the past month, seven north Atlantic right whales have been found floating lifelessly in the Gulf of St Lawrence, off Canada. 
They got the whale totally disentangled and then some kind of freak thing happened and the whale made a big flip,? 
Just a few days before his death, Howlett had helped liberate another north Atlantic right whale in the region, cutting away a fishing line caught in its mouth. ?
