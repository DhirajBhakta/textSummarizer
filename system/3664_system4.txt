In 1986, his name appeared in the Guinness Book of World Records for performing 833 eye operations in a day, the highest in the world. 
Kannukota anna (the brother who gives vision) to the local people, has performed as many as 5.79 lakh eye operations so far. 
This tragic fact of rural India spurred Modi to pioneer the concept of mass eye camps.In an assembly line fashion, Modi operates 40 patients an hour, attending to four patients at a time. 
In his mass eye camps, apart from the 5.79 lakh operations, he has examined 50 lakh patients and given free food to over 100 lakh persons.Initially Modi had a hard time communicating his mission to the people.
