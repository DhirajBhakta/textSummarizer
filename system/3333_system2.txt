However, the infection was found in the remaining six children who are being given medicines through the anti- retroviral therapy (ART) centres, he said. 
Prasanna said the state has 26,000 HIV positive people and of them, 10,289 were being provided medicines through five ART and 12 link ART centres (which work like sub-centres of ART), according to the set guidelines. 
"Neither the child patients, nor their parents had to face trouble (during shortage of medicines)," he said. 
For the purpose, the state recently received as many as 2.54 lakh medicines (of different compositions) from the Central government for its ART centres, the director said.
