compromise By Priyanka Tikoo New Delhi, Jul 4 (PTI) China today ruled out a compromise in the military standoff with India in the Sikkim section, and put the onus on New Delhi to resolve the "grave" situation. 
In unusually blunt remarks, Chinas Ambassador to India Luo Zhaohui said "the ball is in Indias court" and it was for the Indian government to decide what options could be on the table to resolve the standoff.
