The Punjabi Prison match, very much like a steel cage match at Hell in a Cell or Elimination Chamber, is where two or more Superstars are locked inside to battle it out for supremacy without outside intervention.The difference being that there is a cage made of bamboo which is again surrounded by another octagonal bamboo structure while being? topped with a series of razor-sharp bamboo spikes.You have to escape not one, but TWO dangerous structures in a #PunjabiPrison match!
