Days after the Supreme Court sacked Board of Control of Cricket in India (BCCI) secretary Ajay Shirke, it has emerged that the Pune-based administrator made several phone calls to England and Wales Cricket Board's (ECB) president Giles Clarke telling him that the limited-overs series could be in jeopardy. 
We have been in touch with all the hosting centres and they have expressed confidence that the games will be managed successfully, just like always, and as on date, we do not anticipate any form of disruption to the series Rest assured, I will personally monitor the series as it unfolds and will keep you posted on the progress," Johri said in his reply.However, Johri, in another email to Clarke on January 7, asked the ECB chief to reveal what Shirke had "communicated" in his "calls".
