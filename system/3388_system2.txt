There is finally good news coming in from Kashmir in the form of tourists visiting the Valley. 
According to the MHA sources, two-and-a-half lakh tourists visited the "paradise on earth" in the first quarter of this year. 
The figure is much lesser than that of the same period of 2016, which witnessed 3-and-a-half lakh tourists visiting the Valley. 
The Valley saw a massive slump in tourist arrival since the death of Hizbul Mujahideen Commander Burhan Wani in July last year. 
The year 2016 saw? an impressive 11 lakh tourists heading to the Valley for vacations till July before Wani's death. 
The MHA sources said, "The decline in this year's visitor number is due to the extended winter season and snowfall, and not militancy related incidents."
BUSINESSMEN SKEPTICAL Zuber Mahajan, tourist related businessman, however, sounded pessimistic.
