I don't want to comment on the PSL issue but yes we are going through tough times and we need to do well in the coming series to boost our people," he said.He conceded that like in 2010 Pakistan cricket team would again have to do a lot to overcome the recent scandal, which has led to the suspension of five players.During the tour of England in 2010, three players - then captain Salman Butt, Mohammad Asif and Mohammad Aamir - were found involved in spot-fixing and banned for five-years.Sarfaraz had earlier said that Pakistan would miss the services of opener Sharjeel Khan in the West Indies as he was suspended in connection with the spot-fixing scandal.Head coach Mickey Arthur said while the PSL scandal and the involvement of his players was disappointing, one had to move on.
