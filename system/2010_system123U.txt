Britain's most famous clock tower, Big Ben, will go silent for the first time since 2007 for a renovation project which will cost more than $40 million. 
The doors of the 157-year-old Elizabeth Tower will be closed for visitors for nearly three years, however no official date has been announced yet. 
The restoration work will begin next year and will involve repairing of the clock hands, its mechanism and pendulum.
