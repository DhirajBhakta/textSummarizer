It's Day 4 of Panneerselvam vs Sasikala duel in Tamil Nadu. 
Both the AIADMK leaders met Governor C Vidyasagar Rao Thursday evening claiming support of majority of MLAs. 
While both the leaders appeared confident of claiming the chief minister's chair, the governor is yet to formally take a call. 
A note surfaced late Friday night indicating that the Tamil Nadu governor is not inclined to invite Sasikala to form the government. 
Sasikala, accompanied by 10 ministers, met the governor and presented him a list of 134 MLAs supporting her.
