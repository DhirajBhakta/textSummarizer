Angelina, who recently spent New Year with her children, sans Brad, slammed him in her recent court filing, according to People. 
Reportedly, Angie claims that Brad is insistent on getting the details relating to custody sealed from their ongoing divorce because he is "terrified that the public will learn the truth."
The filing reportedly states, "There is little doubt that [Brad] would prefer to keep the entire case private, particularly given the detailed investigations by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Dept. of Children and Family Services into allegation of abuse."
