Malhotra (producer of shows such as Zindagi Wins and Ichchapyaari Naagin) say that TV actors do get offers from a few popular brands, but only for digital, banners, and print ads, and not TV commercials.For the past three years, Divyanka has been turning down offers from a Pantene and Surf Excel, as she has very little spare time. 
In big cities, you see big banner ads with popular film actors and sport stars; TV actors replace them in small towns, says Malhotra, who is directing the Rani Mukerji-starrer Hichki.Model-VJ-actor Keith Sequeira, who was part of Raymonds The Complete Man campaign, says that there is a clear demarcation between Bollywood and television actors when leading brands look for a face to market their product.
