Instead of just arresting the traffickers, the police must break the nexus, said Rishi Kant of the Shakti Vahini NGO, who assisted the West Bengal Police in the operation.The crime branch admitted that girls are sold to the brothel owners for Rs 1 lakh and the victims are confined in hidden cells, thrashed, intoxicated, starved and forced into commercial activity.While the victims are compelled to live in terrible conditions, their distressed family members keep running from pillar to post to trace them. 
The crime branch studied the crime pattern to institute effective action against the key perpetrators and real beneficiaries of this illegal trade, the crime branch said in August.The Delhi Police has also proposed to seal the brothel owned by the couple and the matter is pending in the court.At the time of rescue, our team had asked the girls if they wanted to come with us as there are many adult girls who prefer to stay.
