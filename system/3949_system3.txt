To circumvent the  500-metre liquor ban on pubs, bars and restaurants, the developers in Gurgaon are changing the entrance to their properties; making  motorable distance more than 500 metres and moving these establishments out of the purview of the Supreme Court?
The excise department, meanwhile, said the process to measure the motorable distance of the bars and pubs will begin on Wednesday. 
At the Ambience Mall, the developer has closed the entrance to the Leela Ambience Hotel and visitors will now have to drive around the residential complex before entering the hotel. 
Similarly, the entrance to Cyber Hub near Rapid Metro station next to Shankar Chowk has been moved to ensure that the motorable distance is more than a kilometre from NH8.
