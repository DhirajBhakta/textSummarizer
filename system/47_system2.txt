And the veteran actor cant figure out why the film was initially denied certification by the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC), aka Censor Board. 
I think they have a problem with female sexuality being portrayed on screen. 
I have seen the film twice, and its a wonderfully made film that talks about whats going on in society. 
I dont know why the Censor Board had a problem with that, he quips. 
The CBFC letter informing the filmmakers that certification wouldnt be given had called the film lady-oriented, a perplexing word that drew much ridicule from filmmakers and actors. 
For starters, he says, they are supposed to give a film a certificate; they are no authority to ban a film, or stay its release.
