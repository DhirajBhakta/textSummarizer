?The Chhattisgarh government will begin an ambulance service for cows, chief minister Raman Singh said, joining a number of BJP-ruled states to put a stronger focus on protection of the animal that is considered sacred by Hindus.The service will be started in ten districts in the next few months, Singh said, addressing a programme organised by the states commission for protection of cows at Pandit Ravi Shankar University on Sunday.Protecting cows and promoting products derived from them has been in focus since the rise of the Bharatiya Janata Party with the election of Prime Minister Narendra Modi three years ago, at times being seen as a factor that has emboldened vigilante gau rakshaks who have killed and attacked people.
