My lions (Gujarat Babbar Sher) are hungry...I would like to caution you not to go near them as they can harm you," Akhilesh said in a press conference at the Samajwadi Party's office.The statement was an indirect assault on the newly formed government's crackdown on the slaughterhouses as was promised in the manifesto of the BJP.It is to be mentioned that Akhilesh has "imported" Gujarat lions for his dream project Etawan Lion Safari and as per the records of the state government, nearly Rs 1 lakh is spent every month on food and upbringing of each pair of animals.
