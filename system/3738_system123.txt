As the first polls closed on 8 November, Hillary Clinton was preparing for the moment she would at long last take the stage as the first female president of the United States.She instead found herself apologizing to Barack Obama hours later in a harrowing phone call, moments after conceding the presidential election to Donald Trump.Mr President, Im sorry, Clinton told Obama, who had contacted her to extend his condolences for her loss.The phone call is one of several revelations in the new book Shattered, in which the journalists Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes chronicle Clintons 18-month quest to do what eluded her in 2008 and break that highest, hardest glass ceiling.The book sheds particular light on the painful turn of events on election night, as Clinton watched the returns deviate dramatically from the path her campaign had so confidently predicted.
