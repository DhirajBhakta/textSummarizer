To protect the environment, Uniworld Garden, an upscale condominium in Sector 47 on Sohna Road has banned the use of plastic bags on its premises. 
The shopkeepers (on the condominium premises) have been instructed to remove polythene bags at their shops.

Under the initiative, the civic body had conducted an awareness drive at the Sector 56 Huda market.The MCG had conducted a raid in August 2015, in DLF Phase 1, Sector 10 and Sector 56 and seized around 100 kg polythene bags.
