PM Modi is travelling across the globe and boasts about his governance record, but the Delhi police (that reports to Centre) cant secure a government office, Sisodia told reporters after making a visit to the camp office. 
Police officials said that a PCR call was made around 9.16am on Friday when office staff members arrived in the morning and saw that the lock of the main office door was broken. 
An office staff member came early morning and spotted that the door had been forced open. 
They targeted the office when no one was present and took away the footage so that they will not be identified, Singh said.
