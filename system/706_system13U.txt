The high cost of emergency contraception at Boots is preventing women from accessing it when needed.Both Tesco and Superdrug halved the price of their emergency contraceptive following the BPAS campaign, but Boots continues to charge ?28.25 for Levonelle emergency contraceptive (the leading brand) and ?26.75 for its own generic version. 
I urge them to reduce prices in accordance with their competitors.The MP Stella Creasy tweeted that Boots decision contravenes consumer rights act given adds disproportionate charge which is not advertised, while the writer Marian Keyes was among those condemning the company on Twitter, saying she would be withdrawing my (considerable) custom.This is awful @BootsUK @BootsHelp & also contravenes consumer rights act given adds disproportionate charge which is not advertised.. https://t.co/DAvDiN1hAqAnnouncing the retailers change of stance on Friday night, a spokesman for Boots said: Pharmacy and care for customers are at the heart of everything we do, and as such we are truly sorry that our poor choice of words in describing our position on emergency hormonal contraception has caused offence and misunderstanding, and we sincerely apologise.
