Actor Sugandha Mishra, who has part been of multiple comedy shows such as Comedy Circus Ke Taansen and Kapil Sharma show, now stars in the recently launched show, The Drama Company.  
To perform with those limits has been very challenging, says Sugandha.She stresses on the importance of giving female stand-up comedians proper roles in shows.Sometimes it would happen that we are doing some gags,  the makers of the show would keep the girl for giving cues and give the punches to the men.
