 The city could soon get its second underground Metro line after the Colaba-Bandra-SEEPZ corridor. 
The 8-km extension will pass through the Mumbai Port Trust (MbPT) on the eastern waterfront. 
The extension is being planned to provide connectivity up to south Mumbai via port land, which is going to be developed as a second Marine Drive by MbPT.The south Mumbai extension will be partially underground.
