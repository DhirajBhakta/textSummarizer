Director, Ketan Mehta has filed a complaint of cheating against Kangana Ranaut at Mumbai's Economic Offences Wing (EOW). 
Mehta has claimed that Ranaut was on board for his dream project titled Rani of Jhansi: The Warrior Queen and also shot for it. 
Later, the actress replaced Mehta with another director and started shooting for a similar movie with a different title.
