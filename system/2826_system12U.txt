London, Jun 27 (PTI) Singer Ed Sheeran cleared the air that he did not resort to lip-syncing at his Glastonbury concert after he was accused of performing the show on backing tracks. 
The 26-year-old took to Twitter to clarify that his gig was live, just like all his other stage performances. 
"Never thought Id have to explain it, but everything I do in my live show is live, its a loop station, not a backing track.
