Taking care of a daughter and working on a film is not a cake walk. 
The 49-year-old actor, who is currently shooting for Reema Kagti's Gold in London, is also babysitting his daughter as wife Twinkle Khanna is touring Europe. 
Akshay, who is juggling between work and taking care of his daughter, revealed, "Every morning, Nitara and I have breakfast together, then, we go to this park nearby where one can feed rabbits and goats. 
Post 'pack-up', I take my daughter out again.
