The Delhi Police have received a complaint from the lieutenant governors office about several Twitter accounts in the name of the new appointee. 
Police said they would look into allegations that the fake account users had posed as L-G Baijal and tagged other politicians, including chief minister Arvind Kejriwal. 
On Saturday, former home secretary Baijal joined as the 20th L-G of Delhi after Najeeb Jung resigned.
