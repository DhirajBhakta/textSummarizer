For kicking off the initiative, the authority has decided to name lanes of Jhundpura village.We are completing the necessary formalities to start the process of naming lanes in Jhundpura. 
These urban villages are located adjacent to upscale residential sectors but are yet to have basic civic amenities such as drainage, sewage network and roads, among others.We are working on preparing a robust municipal policy to ensure the development of civic facilities in villages on a par with urban areas.
