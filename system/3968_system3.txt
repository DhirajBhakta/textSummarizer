From Sajjad Hussain Islamabad, Apr 1 (PTI) Pakistans former interior minister Rehman Malik today fell for a April Fools Day prank when he reacted to a fake news story about naming of Islamabads new airport after Chinese President Xi Jinping. 
The Express Tribune early today ran a story as an April Fools Day prank on its website that the government has decided to name a new airport in the capital after the Chinese leader. 
Hours later the prank elicited a serious reaction from Malik who expressed serious reservations over it as the airport is named after Benazir Bhutto, the slain leader of Pakistan Peoples Party. 
He warned the government that his party would take the issue to an extreme level if it tried to the rename the airport.
