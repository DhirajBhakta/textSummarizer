In what could be a first, MoS for Finance Arjun Ram Meghwal on Sunday instructed authorities to help villagers in his constituency - Rajasthan's Bikaner - after climbing a tree.A bad cellphone signal forced the MP to take desperate measures, and a special ladder was ordered to help him. 
Meghwal's visit came after residents of Bikaner's Dholiya village complained that the local hospital wasn't staffed with nurses. 
That was the issue Meghwal intended to resolve with his phone call.It wasn't exactly a novel sight for the villagers - they said it was normal for people to climb trees in search of an improved signal.
