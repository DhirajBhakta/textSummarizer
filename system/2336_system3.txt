Kirti Kulhari expressed her disappointment over Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) for making 12 cuts and adding two disclaimers in her forthcoming film Indu Sarkar. 
She said the censor board needs to grow up and let audience decide what they want to see."
I don't know, but it has become like a process where every film needs to go through and I think you should watch the film with reference to the context. 
The filmmaker, who doesn't wish to make the changes as he fears the essence of the film will get affected, was flummoxed by CBFC's decision.Kirti along with filmmaker Madhur Bhandarkar, veteran singer-composer Bappi Lahiri and Miss India Tourism Ishika Taneja was in the capital to launch the film's new song Dilli Ki Raat."
But now daily something or the other is happening, especially I am most concerned about the censor board because if we do what they have asked for, then the whole essence of the film goes."
