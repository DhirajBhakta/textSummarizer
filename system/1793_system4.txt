The Air Traffic Controller (ATC) handled 40 landings and 42 take-offs between 11 am and noon on that day, and broke its previous record of 77 flight movements in an hour, officials said.Also, for the first time, the airport crossed the 50-million passenger mark in a year, with 55.65 million passengers, almost 10 million more than the previous year. 
The ATC complex and the 60-metre-high tower was built in 1999 and are at a considerable distance from the third runway, constructed in 2008.The tower will give controllers a commanding view of the airport, as well as a much larger working space, so that a larger number of controllers can operate and reduce the pressure on the controllers.
