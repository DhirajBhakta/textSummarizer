BJP President Amit Shah today said that in the previous United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government, no one considered Manmohan Singh as the PM, but Prime Minister Narendra Modi had now restored the "pride" associated with the post. 
"In (the) earlier government, every minister thought of? themselves as the PM," Shah said.His comments came at a press conference in Mumbai, where he earlier met with members of the Maharashtra BJP unit's core committee.
