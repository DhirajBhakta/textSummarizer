It now appears that Winston Churchill's "seditious fakir" comment during his wilderness years is linked to an occasion when Mahatma Gandhi posed for portraits at Kingsley Hall in London.The painting, by Ukrainian-born artist Jacob Kramer who spent all his working life in England, was made when Gandhi was at the Second Round Table Conference in 1931.During the London visit, Gandhi had invited Kramer to capture his likeness for posterity.
