Violence in the name of safeguarding cows in India has been making news frequently since the Bharatiya Janata Party backed by Hindutva organisations like RSS came to power at the Centre.
?Two years ago, in Uttar Pradesh's Dadri, a 52-year-old man -- Mohammad Akhlaq -- was mercilessly beaten to death by a Hindu mob accusing him of consuming and storing cow meat. 
Earlier this year, 55-year-old Pehlu Khan, a dairy farmer, transporting cattle he purchased in Jaipur to Haryana, was stopped by so-called 'gau rakshaks' affiliated with the Vishwa Hindu Parishad and Bajrang Dal and was thrashed to death.
