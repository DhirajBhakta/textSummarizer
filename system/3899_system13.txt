The Goa property was once owned by disgraced businessman Vijay Mallya but was taken over by lenders after he failed to repay the loans he took for the now-defunct Kingfisher Airlines.Economic Times reported that the bungalow was sold to film production company Viiking Media & Entertainment, which is owned by actor-businessman Sachiin Joshi. 
The Times of India further added that Joshi paid slightly more than the property's previous reserve price of Rs 73 crore and that SBI chairman Arundhati Bhattacharya had confirmed the sale took place.
