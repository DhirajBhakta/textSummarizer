Sehwag knows the India captain in and out and now has some interesting tales to tell about Kohli.Until Kohli became the captain of the Indian Test team, he was infamous for his brash and aggressive attitude and had quite a few run-ins with opposition players on the field. 
Once Chaudhary told me that Kohli fell ill or was play acting so his coach told him that he wouldn't play in the next match.
