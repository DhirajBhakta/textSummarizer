but that is still nearly 13 times its ?1.34 price tag when it floated less than three years ago.Demand for the shares from City investors was so great that Rolls offloaded 4.5m shares, a 3.9% stake, having initially planned to release 2.5m.He retains an 11.2% holding worth ?222m, and the company is valued at nearly ?2bn.That means Fever-Tree is worth more than Britvic, its 170-year old rival, more than the UK arm of Domino?
s share of a G&T, at least if it is made right.This year, Rolls ended his day-to-day involvement in the company, moving from executive deputy chairman to a non-executive position.That might explain why he feels able to start cashing in, a decision that might have given investors pause for thought if he were still engaged in building the business.And with an extra ?73m in the bank, Rolls has little reason to wait until the sun is past the yard-arm for his first G&T of the day.
