The film, a cinematic adaptation of MT Vasudevan's book Randamoozham, is reportedly going to be made on a budget of Rs 1000 crore, the highest for any Indian film so far. 
Even before the film has gone on floors, it has run into trouble.Kerala Hindu Aikya Vedi president KP Sasikala has threatened to stall the release of the film unless the name is changed, according to a report in The News Minute. 
We are happy but the Hindus here have a condition - only a film which is close to the story of real Mahabharatham written by Vyasan should carry its name.
