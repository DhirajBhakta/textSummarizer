He ordered that no individual involved in the case be released until a court had issued a ruling in line with the countrys sharia laws.In the order, King Salman urged people to remain vigilant in monitoring any exploitation of status or abuse of power.After he issued the order, a video seen nearly 250,000 times showed the young, low-level prince, dressed in a black T-shirt and grey jogging bottoms, handcuffed and with his feet chained, being escorted into a building by security officers.While many Saudis wrote in support of the kings decision on Twitter, the outspoken rights activist Moudi Aljohani said the order pointed to how lax the authorities were when it came to royals.The arrest comes a day after state media reported that a woman filmed walking around a historic Saudi fort in a miniskirt and crop top sparked outrage among conservatives for defying the kingdoms dress code for women, which requires females in public to cover themselves in long, loose robes.
