A man has been arrested here after he was allegedly found extracting money from passengers on a train posing as a Travel Ticket Examiner (TTE), officials said. 
Pravesh Rawat was issuing "receipts" to some passengers who were travelling without ticket and collecting "fine" from them on board the train from Dehradun to Delhi yesterday, an official of the Government Railway Police (GRP) said. 
However, some frequent travellers soon got suspicious of his actions and alerted the GRP, he said.
