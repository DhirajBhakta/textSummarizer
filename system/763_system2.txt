Actor Prachi Desai, who bid goodbye to her TV career in 2009 after doing the popular show Kasamh Se, is miffed with the kind of content Indian television has today. 
Prachi started her career in Bollywood with the 2008 film Rock On! 
However, she feels that the film industry is quick to stereotype an actor. ?
I recently turned down a couple of big films, because they all wanted me to do the same kind of thing again and again. 
I would rather explore the actor in me than just stand there and be one among the many,? 
adds Prachi, , who is soon going to appear in a short film, Carbon, alongside actors Nawazuddin Siddiqui and Jackky Bhagnani.Follow @htshowbiz for more
