While Akshay and his co-star Bhumi Pednekar are yet to start ground promotions for the film, it looks like fans have already started spreading the word.One of the most remarkable fan tributes is a rap video, with quirky lyrics and peppy beats, made by Abhishek Bhatt aka ABRK. 
Khiladi for always inspiring us.While Abhishek only hoped that his idol would watch the video, he probably never expected Akki to acknowledge his gesture by not only sharing the video on Twitter but also giving a salute to the fan who made it.
