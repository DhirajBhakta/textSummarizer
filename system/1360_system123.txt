Houston, Jan 30 (PTI) An online donation drive to rebuild a mosque that was gutted by fire in Victoria in the US state of Texas has raised more than USD 780,000, demonstrating the overwhelming goodwill from people in the city and beyond. 
The incident occurred within hours of President Donald Trump announcing a ban on citizens from seven Muslim majority countries entering the United States.
