A Canadian lobster fisherman who saved dozens of endangered whales after they became tangled in fishing nets has been killed  moments after a last successful rescue.Joe Howlett, from Campobello Island, New Brunswick, boarded a vessel off the provinces eastern coast on Monday to help rescue a north Atlantic right whale that had become heavily tangled in rope. 
They got the whale totally disentangled and then some kind of freak thing happened and the whale made a big flip, Green, who was not onboard the vessel, told the Canadian Press.Howlett had previously saved some two dozen whales over the past 15 years, making use of his deep knowledge of knots and ropes to set the huge mammals free.
