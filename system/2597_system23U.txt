Donald Trump has accused James Comey, the former director of the FBI, of leaking classified material by passing a memo of their private conversations to the press.James Comey leaked CLASSIFIED INFORMATION to the media, the president tweeted at 6.40am on Monday. 
The allegation, the latest phase of Trumps war on Comeys credibility, appeared to come in response to a report first published by the Hill which then gained extensive coverage on the conservative Fox News channel.But Comeys defenders are likely to object that, even by the Hills account, not all the memos he kept were classified, and there is no proof he released one in that category.Comey told a high-profile congressional hearing last month that he had decided to keep a written record of his dealings with Trump because he thought the president might lie about the nature of our meeting.He explained to the Senate intelligence committee: I knew there might come a day when I would need a record of what had happened, not just to defend myself, but to defend the FBI and our integrity as an institution and the independence of our investigative function.He also testified that, following his dismissal, he used a third party to pass to the New York Times the details of conversations with Trump, in the hope of increasing pressure to get a special counsel appointed in the Russia investigation.
