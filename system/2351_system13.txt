Bhatt said they have been getting a good response.We are also asking the families to sit together at least once a week to help to create bonhomie and strengthen ties among the members, he said.Atul Pingle, a senior RSS leader and Vidarbha Prant Pracharak Pramukh, said such an initiative was the need of the hour when people were becoming more materialistic and self-centred.We will also visit the families of minorities like Muslims and Christians, said Pingle, adding the campaign would help restore harmony, friendship and community bond among people.The Kutumb Prabodhan campaign is a major initiative of the RSS, the ideological mentor of the ruling BJP, after its pet project of one temple, one crematorium and one well for all in each village that was launched last year across the country on Dr Babasaheb Ambedkars 125th birth anniversary in an effort to propagate social equality and harmony.
