A Russian television journalist was punched in the face live on air Wednesday as he reported on raucous annual celebrations by paratroopers in Moscow.  
Nikita Razvozzhayev, a correspondent with the pro-Kremlin NTV channel, was extolling the professionalism of Russias airborne forces when a bearded man staggered up to the presenter and began an expletive-laden rant about invading Ukraine. 
When the reporter asked him to be quiet, the man then punched the journalist hard in the face forcing him to stop his broadcast.
