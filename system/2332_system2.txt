On the third championship point, Muguruza stops mid-point and challenges, what judgment, because Williamss effort was long and Muguruza is the Wimbledon champion for the first time!

First set: *Williams 3-3 Muguruza (*denotes next server)A vicious body serve from Muguruza, a good tactic against the 61 Williams. 15-0.
