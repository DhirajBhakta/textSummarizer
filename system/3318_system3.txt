The incident comes about three years into Prime Minister Narendra Modi's flagship Swachh Bharat Mission that aims to make the country clean and free of open defecation by 2019. 
Some said they have been forced to answer nature's call out in the open.Asked if he will form a task force to look into the matter, the minister said, "We are making efforts for better utilisation of stadiums. 
The same committee will also give report on such issues and on how the agencies here in such stadiums work."
