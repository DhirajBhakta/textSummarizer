We thought that we could give them the funeral they deserved one day, their youngest daughter Marceline Udry-Dumoulin told the Lausanne daily Le Matin.I can say that after 75 years of waiting this news gives me a deep sense of calm, added the 79-year-old.In an overnight statement, Valais cantonal police said that two bodies bearing identity papers had been discovered last week by a worker on Tsanfleuron glacier near a ski lift above Les Diablerets resort at an altitude of 2,615 metres (8,600 feet).DNA testing would be carried out to confirm the identities of the couple.The bodies were lying near each other. 
It was a man and a woman wearing clothing dating from the period of World War Two, Bernhard Tschannen, director of Glacier 3000, told the paper.They were perfectly preserved in the glacier and their belongings were intact.We think they may have fallen into a crevasse where they stayed for decades.
