A woman who had to catch an early morning train had a horrifying experience when a man was masturbating looking at her at Mumbai's CST railway station.? What's more shocking is that when she called a police posted at the railway station where the accused was present, he did nothing and asked the woman to sit somewhere else and left.The woman filmed the entire incident and posted it on social media on July 12. 
As the post went viral, the cops immediately acted on the post and within six hours they arrested the accused. 
With no help in sight, the woman soon shared the ordeal and posted the video on social media.
