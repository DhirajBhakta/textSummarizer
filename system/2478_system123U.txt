It was an acclaimed debut performance by an actor who was already a top fashion model.As the film completes five years today, Diana goes down memory lane and says that she wasnt sure whether shed be able to pull off Meeras character. 
It was my first film and with no background in acting, I wasnt sure if I could play the part.
