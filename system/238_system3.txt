"A typical truck spent 20 per cent of its runtime at interstate checkposts (pre GST)...Inter-state check posts removed, travel time of long-haul trucks, other cargo vehicles cut by at least one-fifth," the Ministry has said in a recent report. 
The Ministry said trucks earlier took 50-65 hours in reaching Kolkata from Chennai and the travel time now stands reduced by 20 per cent. 
Road Transport and Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari, had last week said that Indias logistics sector stands to gain the most under the GST regime as costs will dip by almost 20 per cent. 
Monitoring and collection of sales tax at inter-state check posts led to major traffic congestion at these points, resulting in slower movement of freight and passenger, and consequently higher costs and pollution, it said and added, an average Indian truck covers only about 50,000-60,000 km a year as against 3 lakh km done by a truck in the US. 
This will result in reducing travel time of long-haul trucks and other cargo vehicles by at least one- fifth, the report said. 
Efficient freight movement will also boost the demand for high tonnage trucks, which will in turn reduce the cost of transportation of freight," the report said.
