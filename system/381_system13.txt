Del Olmo, who was renting a studio attached to his house, was a verified user and considered a superhost for Airbnb, meaning he had positive reviews and frequently had guests.I assumed that I would be in especially good hands, said Lapayowker.But, according to the suit, Del Olmo immediately made her uncomfortable by making sexually suggestive comments, pounding on her windshield while she was in her car and screaming at his son loud enough so she could hear.He scared me, she added.Lapayowker decided to leave after three nights, and when she returned to get a laptop she left and told him she was moving out early, Del Olmo said he wanted to show her something of importance inside the studio, the suit said.He then allegedly locked the door, dropped his shorts and began masturbating in front of her, demanding that she touch him and taste it.
