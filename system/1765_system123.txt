The Delhi Police have received a complaint from the lieutenant governors office about several Twitter accounts in the name of the new appointee. 
Fake accounts in the name of L-G Anil Baijal surfaced on Sunday and Monday, after an account was created by the L-G House on Sunday. 
Police said they would look into allegations that the fake account users had posed as L-G Baijal and tagged other politicians, including chief minister Arvind Kejriwal.
