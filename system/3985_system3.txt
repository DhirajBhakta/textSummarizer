2017 began with the clash of the titans - Shah Rukh Khan's Raees and Hrithik Roshan's Kaabil battling it out at the box office. 
Kaabil's producer Rakesh Roshan cried foul and alleged that the exhibitors were giving SRK's film the upper-hand, with a greater distribution of screens. 
In the race, it may have been Raees who won, but Kaabil did not give up without a fair fight.Now, weeks after the clash, Kaabil's director Sanjay Gupta seems to have sly-tweeted about Shah Rukh Khan. 
With Akshay Kumar announcing the release of his Toilet: Ek Prem Katha on the same day as Shah Rukh Khan's next directed by Imtiaz Ali, the Independence Day weekend is going to witness another gigantic box office clash.Sanjay tweeted, "KARMA, you beauty! 
I love and believe in you so much. 
I love how you go after all that f*** with you. 
KARTAM BHUKTAM on Independence Day."
