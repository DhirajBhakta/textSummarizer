I will take this time to heal and do all the different suggested methods of rehabilitation and healing processes so I can get back on the court as soon as possible,? 
It will take a couple of months at least without a racket and I hope after that I can start to train. 
I want to thank Andre for being with me this year and sharing his experience and wisdom and I?
m also very grateful that I kept my body very healthy throughout the years. 
I have time where I can dedicate myself to healing and building up my body and strength and focusing on certain elements of my game that I never had time to work on. 
Now I have time to perfect it and build the foundations for the next five years or more. 
I really want to play professional tennis for years to come.?
