Two weeks after a 15-year-old girl accused a 35-year-old builder and his four friends of allegedly raping and blackmailing her over a period of four months in south Delhis Jamia Nagar, the police on Saturday arrested the builder from Bijnor in Uttar Pradesh. 
The arrest of Sajid Khan came hours after the girls mother was shot at allegedly by two unidentified bike-borne men, some distance away from her home in Jamia Nagar.
