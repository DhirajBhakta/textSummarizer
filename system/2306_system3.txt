Comedian Tanmay Bhat came under fire after an AIB meme got viral which showed Prime Minister Narendra Modi using a dog filter on Snapchat. 
A post shared by Derek O'Brien (@quizderek) on Jul 14, 2017 at 9:44pm PDTIt seems it wasn't Derek's idea to use the dog filter. 
https://t.co/g8Dxay8HMlThe jocular challenge excited TMC's Derek compelling him to think about spreading some good fun around, especially when the situation got uptight after AIB's Tanmay Bhat was booked for a meme of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.What a good idea . 
Hmmm On itDerek gracefully applied the dog filter, the same filter which is landing people in jails in the present times. 
?Thiruvananthapuram MP Tharoor directed the tweet towards the trolls tagging AIB's Twitter handle.Attn all trolls: I took the #DogFilter challenge!
