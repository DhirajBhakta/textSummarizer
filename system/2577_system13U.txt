The lawyer of 1993 Mumbai serial blast convict Abu Salem on Monday began his arguments and sought lesser sentence to the extradited gangster before the special Tada court. 
Salems lawyer Sudeep Passbola told the court that some of the convicts, sentenced in the first set of trial, were awarded eight years imprisonment for the offence committed which was similar to what Salem was tried for.
