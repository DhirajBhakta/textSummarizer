Theres an empty stretch of field off highway 141 in Colorado that used to be the perfect American town. 
Richard Craig, a former Nucla town board member, recalled a comment by a member of an environmental group saying during one of the contentious hearings: Well, I dont see why they dont want to go live in the city.Its almost like  I hate using this word, its being used so often  its almost like a conspiracy: We need to move everybody out of rural areas and go live in the cities and suburbs, Craig said.Nucla made national headlines in 2013.
