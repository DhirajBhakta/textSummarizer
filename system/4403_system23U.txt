In a big relief for cola majors Pepsi and Coca Cola, the Madras High Court today revoked the order banning the two firms from using Thamirabarani river water. 
In November 2016, the court had banned Pepsi and Coke from using the river's water for their bottling plant on a plea that these companies were depriving farmers of their livelihood, who were unable to take up farming activities.The companies paid only 37.50 paise per 1,000 litres of water extracted and sold their beverages at a much higher cost, the PIL filed by Prabakar, Secretary of Tirunelveli Consumer Protection Association, stated.Allowing supply of Thamirabarani water to the two companies would affect lives of people in five districts, the petitioner had said and sought its sale to be stopped.
