A large diamond ring is expected to fetch ?350,000 at auction 30 years after its owner paid ?10 for it at a car boot sale, thinking it was a costume jewel.The exceptionally sized stone was presumed not to be real because 19th-century diamonds were not cut to show off their brilliance like todays gems. 
No matter what your background is or what your past experiences have been, its going to revolutionise someones life.The diamond is thought to have been cut in the 19th century but its history and how it arrived at the car boot sale are unknown.Wyndham said the older style of diamond cutting was slightly duller and deeper than you would see in a modern style  it could trick people into thinking its not a genuine stone.She added: The diamond cutter is looking to maximise the amount of brilliance from the stone because thats what makes it sparkly, she said.With an old style of cutting, an antique cushion shape, the light doesnt reflect back as much as it would from a modern stone cutting.
