In terms of one specific name Dawood Ibrahim, there were reports that NSA Ajit Doval has handed over a dossier to UAE, can you confirm it sirA: Well, I know there are international laws, rules and regulations, there are bilateral agreements and those agreements you know finalises any or emphasises on any decision that a country might take in terms of extraditing. 
Now, I have no information on who specifically they have been looked at or asked for but I know we have a very strong relationship and there has been several meetings between the NSA and our NSA and other organisations in the UAE and within that framework, within the legal framework, within the agreement there will be a final understanding.Q: Because there are also reports that UAE had cracked down and confiscated some of the properties. 
I don't think any action can be taken against anyone without that legal process, without the jurisdiction process.Q: But if you find substance in India's evidences against Dawood Ibrahim, the UAE will actA: Then again, there are agreements as I said.
