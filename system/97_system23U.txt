Allahabad, Aug 01 (PTI) The Allahabad High Court today said it would hear afresh the appeals filed by Rajesh and Nupur Talwar challenging their conviction in the murder of their daughter Aarushi and domestic help Hemraj, seven months after reserving its judgement in the matter. 
A division bench comprising Justices Bala Krishna Narayana and Arvind Kumar Mishra said it would hear the matter again due to "contradictions" in some submissions made by the CBI in the sensational murder case and fixed August 31 for resuming the hearing.
