Decision likely in crucial AIADMK meet tomorrowHere's the full text of Gautami's letter:I have written an open and very direct letter to our Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi ji, regarding my questions on the tragic demise of Amma, our Honourable Chief Minister Dr. 
I have addressed our Prime Minister on the most democratic public platform as this is a matter that is of the greatest public relevance and importance.Our Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi ji, has been one of, if not our earliest, political leaders to embrace the ways of today's modern world. 
There are several examples of his drive and initiatives to this effect but I will not digress in order to reiterate what is a very well-known fact.If we are to be told today that a letter that was addressed directly to our Prime Minister, the contents of which raged across our nation both on national media and social media, has escaped the notice of his office and therefore himself, it is an extremely devastating reality for us to face. 
As a political leader, who has promised to listen to his people and bring about true and meaningful change in the way this country has been governed through the past decades, this denying any knowledge even of a justified and rightful query from the very citizens of his country is disappointing to say the least.
