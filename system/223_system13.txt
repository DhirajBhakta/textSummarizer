Up to 76 people were rescued from cable cars suspended over the river Rhine in Cologne on Sunday afternoon after a gondola crashed into a support pillar, leaving passengers stranded. 
German fire crews lowered people to safety from cable cars in a dramatic recovery operation, with children seen clinging to parents as they dangled 40 metres above the river. 
Fortunately, we were given hand signals to tell us we should remain calm and the incident was nothing bad.Emergency services from Aachen and Dusseldorf assisted fire crews with the rescue.
