Beijing, Jun 8 (PTI) An artificial intelligence robot that took a college entrance exam in China has managed to scrape a below average grade, although it finished the test much faster than humans. 
It finished the test in 22 minutes, scoring 105 points out of 150 points, without Internet support. 
"It would take two hours for a human to finish the test. 
In February, the robot scored 93 on one math test, slightly higher than the passing grade of 90. 
Chinas Ministry of Science and Technology plans to build AI robots by 2020 that would be smart enough to gain admission to leading universities through the entrance exam, the state- run news agency Xinhua reported.
