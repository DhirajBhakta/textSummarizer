Batting coach Sanjay Bangar says Anil Kumble's departure as head coach has definitely left a void in the Indian cricket team set-up even though the players are "coping up" well.Kumble, a spinner par excellence and a former India captain, tendered his resignation as chief coach after the ICC Champions Trophy due to "untenable" differences with skipper Virat Kohli.On the eve of the second ODI against the West Indies here, questions related to the Kumble episode were directed at Bangar."
