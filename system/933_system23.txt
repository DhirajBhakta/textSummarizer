The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) demolished 40 illegal food and clothing stalls and razed extensions of more than 100 stores near Santacruz station on Tuesday. 
The action is part of a BMC drive against establishments setting up sheds and stalls that encroach onto public spaces  meant to be kept free and open for easy access by fire engines in case of an emergency.
