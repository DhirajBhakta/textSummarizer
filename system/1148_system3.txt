The Border Security Force (BSF) has seized fake Indian currency notes (FICN) worth 2 lakh rupees from West Bengal's Malda district after it thwarted a bid to smuggle fake currency into from across Bangladesh. 
This recovery by the BSF, from the porous Indo-Bangladesh border, comes as a huge setback for the central government, which has been claiming that its demonetising 500 and 1000 rupee notes put a full stop on terror financing and smuggling of fake currency. 
On February 14, the BSF in a joint operation with NIA, arrested a fake currency racketeer called Umar Faruq alias Firoz from Churiantpur border outpost in Gopalganj area of Malda.
