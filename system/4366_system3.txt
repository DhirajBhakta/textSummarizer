London, Mar 5 (PTI) Muslim women swimmers have won the right to race in loose-fitting full body outfits or burkinis while taking part in amateur swimming competitions in England. 
On a request from the Muslim Womens Sport Foundation, the Amateur Swimming Association (ASA) has relaxed its swimsuit regulations to allow women to wear loose-fitting full body outfits. 
"Once the referee has been informed of a swimmer wishing to wear a suit, as described above, there is no requirement for the referee to question the swimmer further, the ASA swimming management group do not want athletes being asked why they wish to wear the suit," it says.
