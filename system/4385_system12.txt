New Delhi, Mar 3 (PTI) Taking on Rahul Gandhi for his criticism of Prime Minister Narendra Modi over cleaning of the Ganga, Union Minister Uma Bharti today asked the Congress leader to refrain from making "frivolous" comments. 
Bharti, Union Minister for Water Resources, claimed the work on cleaning the river was on and lay a wager that the Congress vice president "jumps into the river" if positive results of the first phase of the project were not evident by 2018 "otherwise I will jump".
