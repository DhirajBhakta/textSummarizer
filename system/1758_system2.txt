Minister Thiruvananthapuram, Jan 3 (PTI) Keralas tourism sector has registered an estimated loss of about Rs 1,000 crore, following a dip in the arrival of foreign and domestic tourists since the Centre announced demonetisation of high-value currencies, the state government said today. 
The cash crunch has severely affected the sector and the loss was estimated to be about Rs 1,000 crore since the demonetisation of old Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes came into effect from November 8 last, state Tourism Minister Kadakampally Surendran told a press conference here. 
"The currency crunch arose during the tourism season itself and so, things went wrong to a great extent," Surendran said, adding that foreign tourists were not getting enough cash at airports on their arrival. 
Tourists were also spending very little money in the state now which had affected the local traders, said Surendran. 
The houseboat business, one of the main attractions of backwater tourism in Kerala, was "on the verge of collapse", he said and added that the state government would do "everything possible" to boost the tourism sector.
