Biju Janata Dal (BJD) MLA Manas Madkami loves his sparkling white shoes so much that he wouldn't mind being lifted and carried by his supporters to prevent them from getting dirty.This was evident when he allowed a couple of men carry him across a muddy patch during a visit to his home constituency - Malkangiri on Tuesday (July 11).
