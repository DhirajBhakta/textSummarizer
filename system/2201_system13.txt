They havent even nominated Aamir Khan for Dangal and Akshay Kumar for Airlift and Rustom just because they wouldnt attend their weekend holiday plans masquerading as an awards function.Nihalani says many actors who were taken to New York did not even attend the awards events. 
What I want to know is, who is paying for this extravagance, asks Nihalani, and adds, It is our foreign exchange being squandered as every top star is given tickets for his spouse, children, parents , ayahs, bodyguards, friends, friends of friends ..
