But I dont wish to continue any further and want to remain in India, said a passenger after he got off an Air India flight from Dubai at the IGI Airport here today. 
Muhammad Ahmad Sheikh Muhammad Rafiq, a Pakistani passport holder, approached a help desk at the airport and conveyed to a lady at the counter that he wanted to share information about Pakistans snooping agency, ISI. 
Taken aback by his statement, the lady quickly informed security officials who detained him immediately and informed the central intelligence agencies.
