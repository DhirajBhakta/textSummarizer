The search and rescue operation launched after an old bridge collapsed in South Goa on Thursday evening has been affected by the presence of crocodiles in the river. 
Bodies of two people have been recovered so far and several are still missing as divers are finding it difficult to go deep into the Sanvordem river due to fear of crocodiles in the water.
