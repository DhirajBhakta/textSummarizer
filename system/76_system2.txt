It said indiscriminate dumping of waste was a direct source of pollution in the river. 
A bench headed by NGT chairperson justice Swatanter Kumar said the department of irrigation of Delhi and UP would have to carry out these directions. 
The debris on either side of the river Yamuna, if not already removed, shall be removed within three weeks, the bench said. 
The green court said work to rejuvenate the Yamuna should not be stopped unnecessarily as pollution was rising daily and any inaction on part of authorities cannot be tolerated.In the interest of environment and public health, the government and all authorities concerned must perform their function and ensure that the Yamuna is rejuvenated to its original pristine status.
