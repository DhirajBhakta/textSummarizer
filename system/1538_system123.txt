National Award-winning filmmaker Vetrimaaran on Monday came out in support of jallikattu saying that before asking for a ban on the traditional and ancient bull-taming sport, people should think about banning crackers on Diwali and immersing Lord Ganesh idols in water during Ganesh Chaturthi which disturbs the eco-system."
The main reason why PETA and others want to put a ban on this traditional practice (jallikattu) is that they say it's cruelty to animals," said Vetrimaaran.
