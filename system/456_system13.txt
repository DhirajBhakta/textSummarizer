The Yamuna Expressway industrial development authority (YEIDA) is likely to begin land acquisition as the Centre has given its nod for the project.We will not let the land acquisition take place for the airport project because the state government is cheating farmers by giving them only Rs3,500 per square metre (psm) for land. 
We are likely to start a campaign telling all villagers along the expressway not to give their land for the project until the UP government gives better compensation, said Ajaypal Sharma, district president, Bharatiya Kisan Union.The Greater Noida and Yamuna Expressway authorities are buying land from farmers through direct purchase for Rs3,000 to Rs5,000 psm.
