The construction will begin shortly after the foundation-laying ceremony is held in September, said Achal Khare, managing director, National High Speed Rail Corporation (NHSRC).Being constructed over railway land measuring 4,400 metres at an estimated cost of Rs 600 crore, the training centre will have a sample track fitted with the overhead electrical systems to enable testing of bullet trains that will run on the Mumbai-Ahmedabad route.While Indias first bullet train is proposed to hit the track in 2023, the training centre is supposed to start operating by 2020, Khare told HT.The training of 4,000 rail engineers has been envisaged before 2020.
