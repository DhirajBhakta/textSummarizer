Lt Governor Anil Baijal "fires one bullet at me" every day, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said.This is Kejriwal's first direct attack at Baijal since he was appointed the Lt Governor of Delhi on December 31, 2016.Noting that his government tries to coordinate on various issues related to the development of the national capital, both with the Lt Governor as well as the Centre, Kejriwal said that "the firing" has intensified just before the MCD polls."
We are trying to cooperate with everybody (the Centre and the LG) so that there is development of Delhi, but the Lt Governor fires one bullet at me (every day)," Kejriwal said.He also termed the report of Shunglu Committee as "politically motivated".
