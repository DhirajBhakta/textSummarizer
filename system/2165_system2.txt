Even as he agrees that one cannot deny the existence of nepotism in Bollywood, filmmaker Neeraj Ghaywan, who bagged the National Award for his debut film Masaan, believes the issue has been blown ?
I think the issue (of nepotism) is overblown and has turned pointless now. 
I agree that we need acknowledge that it exists and there is a certain set of privileges that these actors enjoy. 
Deepika Padukone and Ranbir Kapoor are two actors I would like to work with. 
I think Piku was one of Deepika?
s films, I really liked Rocket Singh.??
I believe the women are doing much better than the men nowadays. 
s) but I liked it and wanted to build upon it in a real background.
