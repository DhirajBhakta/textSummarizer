 A day after the district administration and the police, in a joint operation, seized illegally mined sand from two villages of Sikandarpur and Murshadpur, the district magistrate said he was planning to start night patrolling on the floodplains of river Yamuna to curb sand mining. 
Residents of the villages near the floodplains feel that there is a dire need to have night patrolling as sand mining mostly takes place at night.Sand mafia groups transports the sand in dumpers at night.
