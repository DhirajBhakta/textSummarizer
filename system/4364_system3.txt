Pitching for Aam Aadmi Partys victory in the upcoming municipal elections, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said if his party comes to power in MCD then they will make Delhi comparable to London.Addressing a gathering at Uttam Nagar, Kejriwal said the BJP-ruled municipal bodies have not been able to keep Delhi clean.The dates for MCD elections are yet to be announced.Last time you gave us 67 seats but this time dont even leave the 3 seats. 
If we win MCD once, we will change Delhi so much in one year that you will compare Delhi to London, he said.The CM said that people have the misconception that Delhi is not clean due to AAP governments failure. 
But where is all this money Why is Delhi not being cleaned They make the same road thrice on paper and eat all the money, he said.Kejriwal said his government has been able to do many things in the last two years which the BJP-run governments in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh have not been able to do in the last 10-15 years.Before we came to power, the Delhi government had a policy of doing development activity in regularised colonies only.
