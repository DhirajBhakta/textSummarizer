By Yoshita Singh New York, Jun 18 (PTI) Leading online lodging service Airbnb is buying a California-based background-check startup founded by three Indian-origin entrepreneurs in 2014 as it seeks to protect its users and hosts from undesirable and fraudulent people. 
According to profiles of the founders on the Trooly website, Baveja, who is also the companys CEO, had previously served as senior partner at the strategy consulting firm Bain & Company, and a member of the Bain Board of Directors.
