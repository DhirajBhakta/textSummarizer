Amar Singh, the name once synonymous with Samajwadi Party, has lashed out at its President and former Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav after two SP leaders quit the UP Legislative Council. 
In an exclusive conversation with India Today, the party's former general secretary, Amar Singh, said that the Samajwadi Party has a dark future without its leader, Mulayam Singh Yadav.? Amar Singh was dismissed from the SP just ahead of the Uttar Pradesh Assembly election as the Yadav clan was embroiled in a bitter tussle to control the party. 
He claims to have snapped all ties with his political mentor.Reacting to the exit of two party legislators from the UP Upper House, Amar Singh said,"I am not happy at what's happening to the party which I raised with so much hard work and I am also not responding to any calls from Mulayam Singh Yadav since I was ousted twice from the Samajwadi Party and humiliated."
