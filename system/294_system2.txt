Shenaz will next be seen in the film Kaalakaandi alongside Saif Ali Khan, who along with filmmaker Karan Johar and actor Varun Dhawan was criticised for his Nepotism rocks act at the IIFA Awards earlier this month.The debate started in Bollywood when Kangana Ranaut branded Karan as a flagbearer of nepotism on his chat show Koffee With Karan earlier this year. 
People like Kangana have to work a million times harder than someone from a filmy family, she added.Talking about her struggle in showbiz, Shenaz said, When I was a teenager, I wanted to be a screenplay writer or a photographer.
