But as soon as Dutt was arrested in 1993 Bombay blasts, Madhuri started to maintain her distance, and as they say, rest is history. 
But decades later, filmmaker Rajkumar Hirani has decided to bring Sanju baba's life on 70mm. 
And if reports are to be believed, Madhuri's existence in his life has been carefully cropped in the biopic. 
However, in an interview to Mid-Day, Madhuri rubbished the rumours and said, "For where I am today, this [the topic of Dutt] has become redundant. 
Life has come a long way since then. 
I don't know where these reports are coming from. 
In any case, it doesn't make a difference to me."
