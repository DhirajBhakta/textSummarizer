With less than two days' fuel left in pollbound Manipur, the Centre deployed the mighty C-17 Globemaster, the Indian Air Force's largest military transport aircraft, to airlift 96,000 litres of fuel. 
An emergency measure taken to mitigate the impact of the fuel crisis triggered by the indefinite economic blockade by United Naga Council, which has been raging on for the past 84 days.While 35 tonne petroleum and diesel were sent through an Indian Airforce C-17 Globemaster plane, 70 tonne more petroleum products will be sent soon, official sources said. 
The move came two days after an interministerial meeting, chaired by Union home minister Rajnath Singh and attended by Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan, reviewed the stock of food grains and petroleum products in Manipur and how to replenish the supply.Pradhan Monday met Singh and briefed him about the supply position.
