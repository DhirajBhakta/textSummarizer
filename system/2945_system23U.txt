Rashid Latif has extended a hand of friendship towards Virender Sehwag after his tirade on social media created a storm in India. 
In the course of the Champions Trophy, Latif had used derogatory language over Sehwag's witty remarks on social media. 
While Sehwag had chosen to maintain a dignified silence, India cricketer Manoj Tiwary posted a video with a like-for-like response to Latif.
