While infrastructure in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) is getting a facelift owing to a torrent of Chinese investment, the terrorism framework in the area too is getting revamped in a bid to foment trouble in India, an India Today TV investigation on ground zero has found.Over 30 religious and jihadi groups have come together to form Daifa-e-Pakistan that has demonstrated and carried out rallies across Pakistan to step up terrorism in Kashmir.According to sources, the aim of the movement is to create a new force of terrorism and channel it against India. 
China's "development" projects" in PoK and neighbouring Gilgit-Baltistan that involve several thousand Chinese personnel belonging to the construction corps of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) point towards Beijing's expansionist geo-strategic agenda in the region.Gilgit-Baltistan is part of the disputed territory of J&K occupied by Pakistan and is known as the Northern Areas of Pakistan. 
There are some in PoK who believe that the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) is going to help economic prosperity in the area but that will be clear only when the projects are completed and locals are engaged by Pakistan in economic activities.So far, residents have not been employed in construction work, except some security personnel who have been engaged for protection of Chinese workers.With the reported stationing of a unit of PLA soldiers near the Khunjerab Pass and Chinese military officials frequenting the field command office of Gilgit, which happens to be Pakistan's military headquarters in the region, a pervasive Chinese intent of establishing a military edge in India's northern sector cannot be negated, observers say.ALSO READ |Is China backing Pakistan's position on PoK projects under its China-Pakistan Economic Corridor plan?
