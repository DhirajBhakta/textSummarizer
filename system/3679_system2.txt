A 22-year-old woman who posed as a cancer patient to con her Facebook friends into giving her Rs 22 lakh, has been arrested in Hyderabad. 
Samia Abdul Hafeez, a resident of the city's Saidabad area, started an online campaign in January, claiming she was suffering from brain and breast cancer and needed money for treatment. 
She had a Facebook page called 'Go Fund Samia.'
Samia's father Abdul Hafeez was actually undergoing treatment for cancer in a well-known private hospital in Hyderabad - that's how she learned about the disease.Several of Samia's Facebook friends made donations, and she ended up Rs 22 lakh richer. 
The money went to her account in State Bank of Hyderabad's Gunfoundry branch.
