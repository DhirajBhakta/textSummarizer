As he/she points out, the intention behind the original post (accusing Joshi of molestation) was to "expose" the woman who accused TVF CEO of sexually harassing her.Well, good job, buddy! 
I am open and willing, and even urge @MumbaiPolice to investigate thisBut any competent authority who wants to investigate is welcome to, and I encourage whoever wrote that to pursue the matter earnestly.When another Twitter user brought to Joshi's attention the new Reddit post, claiming he is a "great guy", and rubbishing the sexual harassment claims, Joshi just 'sighed'.
