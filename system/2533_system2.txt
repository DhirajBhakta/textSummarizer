The Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) is going to be history by the year 2025 if new buses are not inducted to its fleet.The corporation is in a major fix as 99% buses of its existing fleet of 3951 will have to be taken off roads in a span of over five years. 
It has been over four years since buses were inducted to its fleet, even as three attempts to procure new ones have failed owing to tender issues, especially regarding their maintenance. 
The issue is that the maintenance cost of a bus is so high that manufacturers do not want to take the onus on them, officials said.While there are 3,781 low-floor buses plying in the Capital, it is the 170 standard floor buses that are the oldest (more than 10 years old) and will be condemned in the coming months.The DTC which is one of the oldest State Transport Units (STUs) of India is also worried that if things do not move quickly form here it would be left with only 6,517 employees by 2025 out of which 5052 will be regular drivers alone.
