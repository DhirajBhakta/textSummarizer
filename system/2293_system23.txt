The decision comes after the Noida authoritys traffic cell found out that 80% of road markings in the city are either washed away or fade out on their own. 
The project involves marking of zebra crossings, left-right turns, stop lines for vehicles and designated spaces for pedestrians, who often face problems negotiating traffic without adequate markings on roads. 
We hope to finish the road marking work very soon in order to enable the traffic police to penalise violators, Chandra said.
