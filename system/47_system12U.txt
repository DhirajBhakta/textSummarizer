And the veteran actor cant figure out why the film was initially denied certification by the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC), aka Censor Board. 
I think they have a problem with female sexuality being portrayed on screen. 
I have seen the film twice, and its a wonderfully made film that talks about whats going on in society. 
I dont know why the Censor Board had a problem with that, he quips.
