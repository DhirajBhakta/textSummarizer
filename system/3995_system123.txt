Gaikwad abused and assaulted Air Indias duty manager R Sukumar with slippers after being denied business class seat on a Pune-New Delhi Air India flight last Thursday.The 56-year-old MP was then banned by Air India and five private airlines from flying as he refused to apologise for the incident that triggered nationwide outrage.Fellow MPs criticised Gaikwads action, and Lok Sabha speaker Sumitra Mahajan said she will take a call if any parliamentarian brought the topic to her notice in the House.
