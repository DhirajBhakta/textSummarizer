Actor Tiger Shroff says though he likes to flaunt his dance skills and well-built body on screen, he wouldn?
t mind losing his muscular looks to play a boy-next-door character in the near future.Be it Heropanti or Baaghi, Tiger has showcased his action, dance and martial arts skills. 
He believes he is a fairly good dancer and that he went through intensive rehearsals to get each and every single dance move right.What makes him go through this process despite having the option for a re-take while filming?
Every morning I get up and thank the almighty for all the love and admiration I am receiving from people, my fans... from everyone.
