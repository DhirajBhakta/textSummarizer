What do goats prefer to have when they are really hungry Well, this one apparently likes its food in 'pink' rather than 'green'.A 'hungry' goat chewed Rs 66,000 that its owner had kept in the pocket of his trouser in Siluapur village in Kannauj district of Uttar Pradesh. 
To his shock it was his currency notes that the goat was chewing.? Sarvesh took evasive action to save his money that he had kept to buy bricks for his under-construction house.
