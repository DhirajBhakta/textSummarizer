From Aditi Khanna London, Mar 5 (PTI) Tata Steel may be considering breaking off talks over a planned merger of its European business with German conglomerate Thyssenkrupp, a UK media report claimed today. 
Nearly 10,000 workers voted in a ballot in favour of moving from a final salary pension to a less generous scheme in return for job safety and?Tatas promise of nearly 1-billion-pound worth of investment over the next 10 years. 
According to the newspaper, Dutch unions representing workers at Tatas vast Ijmuiden plant have raised concerns over the Thyssenkrupp pensions, which are an unfunded liability and underpinned by cash-flow from the steelworks.
