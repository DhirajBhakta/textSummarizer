Young visitors at the womens police station in Sector 51 will no longer have to witness quarrelling families, wailing parents and injured victims. 
The police station now has a two-room Phulwari complete with toys, puzzles and a nanny to ensure children do not get affected by their murky surroundings. 
Phulwari, which will also double as a cr?che for children of police personnel, has been provided a separate entry separating it from the main police station section.
