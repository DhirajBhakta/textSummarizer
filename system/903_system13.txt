This will be possible via the newly launched mAadhaar application by the Unique Authentication of India (UIDAI). mAadhaar or Mobile Aadhaar will let you carry the digital version of your Aadhaar eKYC details on your smartphone, just as the name suggests. 
With this initiative, UIDAI reduces the burden of carrying the Aadhaar card everywhere you go, given the fact that Aadhaar eKYC details are required for everything today.
