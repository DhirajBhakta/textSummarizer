A bar in Kerala has come up with an exceptional way to get around the new rule banning alcohol near highways.Aishwarya Restobar in Paravoor, Ernakulam, now has a full-blown maze around the building, much like in Harry Potter and the Goblet of fire (the Triwizard Tournament, duh).ReasonAfter the Supreme Court ruled a ban on the sale of liquor within 500 metres of national/state highways, things became difficult for Aishwarya Restobar as it was situated near NH 17.
