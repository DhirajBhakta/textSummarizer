Samajwadi Party (SP) president Akhilesh Yadav on Tuesday alleged that the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) was trying to implement its "fundamentalist" agenda through the BJP governments, putting at risk the secular character of the country. 
"The politics today is at a very dangerous turn...RSS is conspiring to get its fundamentalist agenda implemented through the BJP governments, which could put the secular character of the country at risk," he told a meeting of SP MLAs and MLCs in Lucknow. 
In a democracy, governments keep changing but these elections were fought on issues "other than development or peoples welfare", the former Uttar Pradesh chief minister alleged while recalling that schemes launched by his government were replicated by the governments of other states.
