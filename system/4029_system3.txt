Samajwadi Party (SP) president Akhilesh Yadav on Tuesday alleged that the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) was trying to implement its "fundamentalist" agenda through the BJP governments, putting at risk the secular character of the country. 
"The politics today is at a very dangerous turn...RSS is conspiring to get its fundamentalist agenda implemented through the BJP governments, which could put the secular character of the country at risk," he told a meeting of SP MLAs and MLCs in Lucknow. 
Referring to the results of the recent Assembly polls in five states, including Uttar Pradesh, Akhilesh accused the BJP of introducing a "new form of political corruption". 
The former chief minister was unanimously elected as the combined leader of the party in both the state Assembly and Council, SP spokesman Rajendra Chaudhary said.? 'BJP HAS NO PLAN FOR UP's DEVELOPMENT "BJP has no plan for the development of Uttar Pradesh...they have formed the government on the basis of false promises. 
In a democracy, governments keep changing but these elections were fought on issues "other than development or peoples welfare", the former Uttar Pradesh chief minister alleged while recalling that schemes launched by his government were replicated by the governments of other states. 
"People will soon start realising the difference between the SP government which had honoured its promises and the BJP government which has only misled them," he claimed.
