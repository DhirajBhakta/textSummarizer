A Delhi police cop has been suspended for getting drunk and flashing in front of a woman colleague at the police training college. 
Police sources said the cop, posted at the police training college in Jharoda Kalan, had also inappropriately touched two women constables at dinner. 
Senior officers who reached the spot held an informal test identification parade during which the complainant identified the man.
