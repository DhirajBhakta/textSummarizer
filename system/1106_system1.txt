In 2008, Wadia signed an agreement with a German firm that it could use all of Wadias' copyrighted material on Fearless Nadia to make a film on her.Seven years later, Roy Wadia got news that a film called Rangoon was being made and that it was supposedly based around Nadia's life. 
Disney UTV (then, headed by Siddharth Roy Kapur) assured Wadia and the German firm that the film wouldn't be made.Then in 2016, while Vishal was making Rangoon with Sajid Nadiadwala, Vishal assured Roy Wadia that his film was a love story set in the backdrop of World War II and was not remotely inspired by Nadia's life.
