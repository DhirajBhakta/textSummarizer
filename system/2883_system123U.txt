BJP leader Subramanian Swamy told India Today that Rajinikanth should not join politics because it will be hard for him to continue because of financial irregularities surrounding the superstar. 
Rajinikanth's famous dialogue is 'If I say it once, it is equivalent to saying it hundred times' (Naan oru thadava sonna, nooru thadava sonna madhiri)," said Swamy, who's personally known to the superstar."
