Monorail services in Mumbai were disrupted on Saturday after a train going to Chembur stopped functioning due to a power failure. 
Passengers who were inside the rake that suffered power failure were helped out using the keys of the monorail staff. 
The pictures of the trains led to speculation that the two rakes came face-to-face and a head-on collision was averted but MMRDA authorities denied reports that two monorail trains nearly crashed.
