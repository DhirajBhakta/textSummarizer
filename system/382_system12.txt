Queensland will have a 2,000km network of electric vehicle charging stations that make up one of the worlds longest electric vehicle highways within six months.The state government announced on Thursday it would build an 18-station network stretching along Queenslands east coast from Cairns to Coolangatta and west to Toowoomba.The stations, which recharge a vehicle in 30 minutes, will offer free power for at least a year in what the environment minister, Steven Miles, said was a bid to boost the number of electric cars on Queensland roads, currently about 700.This project is ambitious, but we want as many people as possible on board the electric vehicle revolution, as part of our transition to a low-emissions future, Miles said.The $3m network had the potential to revolutionise the way we travel around Queensland in the future, he said.Queenslands electric highway will span a comparable distance to the west coast electric highway in the US, which runs from California to Oregon and Washington state.
