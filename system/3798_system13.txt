Encased in polymer beads scattered on the suspected minefield, that fluorescence is then detected by a laser system that researchers suggest could be mounted on a vehicle  including drones.The system has been successfully tested in a field of real landmines, scanning the ground at a rate of around 18cm per second  a speed the researchers hope to increase.Belkins team is not the first to develop bacteria that glow in the presence of explosive vapour  similar findings were reported by a team at Edinburgh University in 2009  but it appears to be the first to have developed a potentially functioning detection system using the technology.Our field data show that engineered biosensors may be useful in a landmine detection system, said Prof Shimshon Belkin, who headed the experiment.
