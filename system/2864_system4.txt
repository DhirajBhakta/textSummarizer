New Delhi, Jun 25 (PTI) Undue sympathy towards convicts by awarding inadequate jail term "undermines public confidence in efficacy of law", the Delhi High Court has said while upholding a 10-year term awarded by a trial court to a man for raping and trying to kill his ex-employers daughter-in-law. 
"Undue sympathy to impose inadequate sentence would do more harm to the justice system to undermine the public confidence in the efficacy of law and society could no longer endure under such serious threat," the court said. 
The trial court had awarded 10 years to the convict for the offence of rape and seven years for attempting to murder the victim, who had assisted him in getting a job and also used to teach his kids.
