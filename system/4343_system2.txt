The film has rubbed the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) the wrong way, as a result of which, it might land in a legal mess.Rangoon, directed by Vishal Bhardwaj, is playing in theatres without a censor certificate and the anti-tobacco short films. 
The film, which is a love story set against the backdrop of the World War II, stars Saif Ali Khan as film producer Rusi Bilimoria, Kangana Ranaut as the fiesty Miss Julia (a character based on Fearless Nadia), and Shahid Kapoor as Jamadar Nawab Malik of the British Indian Army.Rangoon, said Nihalani, has flouted several rules set by the CBFC.
