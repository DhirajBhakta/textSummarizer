The anti-narcotics cell (ANC) of the Mumbai police crime branch arrested a 40-year-old woman selling ganja near a college at Churchgate station on Thursday. 
We are cracking down on peddlers operating near educational institutions as part of our campaign against drugs. 
On frisking her, we found 18 packets of ganja containing 540 grams of the drug, said senior inspector Santosh Bhalekar, from ANCs Azad Maidan unit.
