A BJP MP has moved a private member's bill in the Lok Sabha, seeking reservation of five seats in the Lower House as well as one in the Rajya Sabha for residents of Gilgit and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) regions. 
"It would be proper that seats provided for the Jammu and Kashmir area, which is under illegal occupation of Pakistan, in the Lok Sabha are kept vacant as elections can not be held in these areas," he said. 
"I will approach all the members and try to build a consensus on this landmark legislation," Dubey said, adding that the purpose behind moving this legislation is to highlight the atrocities committed by Pakistan in these areas.
