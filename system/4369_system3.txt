A BJP MP has moved a private member's bill in the Lok Sabha, seeking reservation of five seats in the Lower House as well as one in the Rajya Sabha for residents of Gilgit and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) regions. 
"It is a matter of extreme surprise that the Lower House does not take into account this territory, whereas the State Legislature of Jammu and Kashmir keeps 25 seats vacant for the territory which is under illegal occupation of Pakistan," said Nishikant Dubey, who has piloted the bill. 
INSERTION OF NEW ARTICLE 370AThe Legislation asks for an insertion of new Article 370A, after Article 370, in the Constitution of India, to add five Lok Sabha seats and one Rajya Sabha seat. 
At the same time, these seats shall not be taken into account for reckoning the total membership of both houses and the said area shall be excluded in delimiting the territorial constituencies, the bill proposes. 
"I will approach all the members and try to build a consensus on this landmark legislation," Dubey said, adding that the purpose behind moving this legislation is to highlight the atrocities committed by Pakistan in these areas.
