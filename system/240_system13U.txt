If by saying Jai Shri Ram I can do some good for the Muslims, why is there such a hue and cry, Ahmad, who has been given charge of minority welfare and sugarcane industries, told mediapersons.He would not be cowed down by such threats, he said.The minister later apologised for his statement, while talking to a TV channel.The CM told me if anybody felt hurt by my statement, I should apologise.
