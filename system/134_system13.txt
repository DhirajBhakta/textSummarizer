But the new report that Trump personally oversaw the issuing of a misleading account of the proceedings raises questions about the presidents role in what could be conceived as a cover-up.It comes as Mueller has already expanded his inquiry to include the issue of whether Trump was engaging in a possible obstruction of justice when he fired James Comey, having tried and failed to persuade the then director of the FBI to back off investigating former national security adviser Michael Flynns contacts with Russian officials.A lawyer for the president issued the Washington Post with a curt statement: Apart from being of no consequence, the characterizations are misinformed, inaccurate, and not pertinent, Jay Sekulow said.The new details of the presidents role in what turned out to be a major communications fiasco come on the day that his current communications chief, Anthony Scaramucci, was dismissed from the White House after barely 11 days.
