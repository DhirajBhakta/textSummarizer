London, Feb 9 (PTI) Scientists may have analysed almost 5,000 orangutan "kiss squeaks" - purse-lipped consonant-like calls that appear to convey different messages to understand how human ancestors formed their earliest words. 
The scientists recorded and analysed 4,486 kiss-squeaks recorded from 48 animals in four wild populations. 
The team compared this to how we might use more than one word to convey the same meaning - saying "car" but also "automobile" and "vehicle".
