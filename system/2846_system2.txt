Roger Federer's? 6-1 6-3 win over Alexander Zverev  was nothing short of historic as records tumbled left, right and centre.The Halle Open win was the hundredth title of his long and illustrious career, 92 of which are singles crowns while eight have come in doubles. 
He is 10th to reach this landmark in the history of professional Tennis.With the Grass season truly underway and Wimbledon just around the corner, the Swiss racked in his 16th grass title, nine of which have come at the Halle Open itself. 
He won the title in 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2009 and 2012 are the years he won the Wimbledon Grand Slam.Halle Open also tops the list of most titles for Federer at a single completion with Wimbledon, Cincinnati Masters, Basel and Dubai Opens (all at seven titles) coming in a close second.He is also third on the list of most singles titles and quickly closing in on second placed Ivan Lendl (who has 94 titles) and the leader -- Jimmy Connors, who has 109 titles to his name.The 35-year-old victor claimed the Halle Open title one week ahead of the Wimbledon tournament and had to hardly break a sweat in his 140th career final.Interestingly, he also became the first player to beat both the Zverev brothers at the same event. 
He defeated older sibling Mischa in the round of 16.Federer, who skipped the clay-court season after winning the Miami Open earlier this year, claimed his fourth title of the year. 
He has now matched Rafael Nadal's tally and will be seeded ahead of the Spaniard for Wimbledon, which starts in eight days.
