Minister Thiruvananthapuram, Jan 3 (PTI) Keralas tourism sector has registered an estimated loss of about Rs 1,000 crore, following a dip in the arrival of foreign and domestic tourists since the Centre announced demonetisation of high-value currencies, the state government said today. 
Tourists were also spending very little money in the state now which had affected the local traders, said Surendran. 
The houseboat business, one of the main attractions of backwater tourism in Kerala, was "on the verge of collapse", he said and added that the state government would do "everything possible" to boost the tourism sector.
