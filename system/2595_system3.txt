The announcement came amid mounting pressure on chief minister Nitish Kumar to sack Tejashwi, who along with Lalu is facing charges in an alleged land-for-hotels scandal that saw the Central Bureau of Investigation raiding their homes and other properties last week.Chief minister Nitish Kumar asked Tejashwi Yadav to give a fact-wise reply in public to the corruption charges hurled at him but said the ruling Grand Alliance wont break. 
The chief minister made it clear that so far he has not compromised on standards set for corruption and even a leader of another constituent of a former alliance partner was made to resign, said party spokesperson Neeraj Kumar.
