Fever-Tree, the upmarket tonic water maker, suffered the rarest of hiccups in its meteoric rise after co-founder Charles Rolls cashed in ?73m of shares.The sale left the companys stock down 2% at ?17.12 on Thursday  but that is still nearly 13 times its ?1.34 price tag when it floated less than three years ago.Demand for the shares from City investors was so great that Rolls offloaded 4.5m shares, a 3.9% stake, having initially planned to release 2.5m.He retains an 11.2% holding worth ?222m, and the company is valued at nearly ?2bn.That means Fever-Tree is worth more than Britvic, its 170-year old rival, more than the UK arm of Dominos Pizza, and about three times as much as the Debenhams store chain.That is astonishing for a business with sales of just ?100m and only 46 full-time staff that has done little more than concoct a fancy mixer for gin.
