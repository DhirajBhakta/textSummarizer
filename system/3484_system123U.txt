There is a saying in Bengali which, roughly translated, means that someone who has had a wood apple fall on their head never goes to the orchards again. 
Going by that logic, this young man named Abdul Mannan will never again go near any cattle.On Sunday, 43-year-old Abdul Mannan was out and about in Kolkata's Tiljala area shopping for grocery. 
At one point, Mannan stooped over at a green grocer's stall to check out some cucumbers when calamity fell upon him.Only the calamity here was a calf.
