Air India has alerted its staff to alleged attempts by Shiv Sena MP Ravindra Gaikwad to circumvent a ban on flying by booking flights with different honorifics and spellings of his name.Sources said that Gaikwad is trying different spellings to confuse AI ticketing staff. 
Gaikwad abused and assaulted Air Indias duty manager R Sukumar with slippers after being denied business class seat on a Pune-New Delhi Air India flight last Thursday.The 56-year-old MP was then banned by Air India and five private airlines from flying as he refused to apologise for the incident that triggered nationwide outrage.Fellow MPs criticised Gaikwads action, and Lok Sabha speaker Sumitra Mahajan said she will take a call if any parliamentarian brought the topic to her notice in the House.
