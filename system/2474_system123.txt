Pakistan said today that it was considering a visa application of the mother of Kulbhushan Jadhav for a visit to meet her son, who was sentenced to death by a military court. 
Zakaria's remarks came two days after External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj in New Delhi said that she had written a "personal letter" to Adviser to the Prime Minister on Foreign Affairs Sartaj Aziz asking for approval of Avantika's visa application so that she may travel to Pakistan.
