I am very bad with relationships, I am awful.Unlike his characters on screen who travel continents to profess love, Shah Rukh prefers to hide his emotions.I am extremely one-sided, perhaps even selfish. 
I wont be able to say anything that Ive done in my films to a girl, or even in relationships...I am extremely closeted, introverted, shy, reclusive and completely shut off about my emotions.And this dichotomy is perhaps what helps him play the romantic hero as he believes that an actor is normally attracted to roles that he is not in real life.I dont have to believe in it, I have to make you believe in it and thats a challenge always...
