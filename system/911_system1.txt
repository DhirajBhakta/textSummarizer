Earlier this month, Mumbai based digital media company Culture Machine had announced the 'First Day of Period' leave policy. 
The company's Joint Managing Director MV Shreyams Kumar was quoted as saying that the additional leave will be granted to its women employees which will "not be counted under sick leave or casual leave". 
The first day of period leave will be an additional leave for the women employees and will not be considered as casual leave or sick leave.
