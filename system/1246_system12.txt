Pakistan today claimed that India is building a "secret nuclear city" and has accumulated a stockpile of nuclear weapons which threatens to undermine the strategic balance of power in the region. 
Asserting that India had been "exposed" by the failure of its efforts to isolate Pakistan, he said the Indian government should reciprocate the steps taken by Pakistan for peace. 
"Pakistan remains committed to the principles of peaceful existence with all of its neighbours, including India," he said, adding that Islamabad was open for dialogue and took a number of initiatives but India failed to respond positively.
