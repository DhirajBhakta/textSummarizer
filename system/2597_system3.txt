Donald Trump has accused James Comey, the former director of the FBI, of leaking classified material by passing a memo of their private conversations to the press.?
But it is far from certain that the memo the former FBI director released into the public domain was among those classified, and some critics detected an attempt to deflect attention from revelations over Donald Trump Jr?
I immediately prepared an unclassified memo of the conversation about Flynn and discussed the matter with FBI senior leadership.?
I need to document it and preserve it in a way, and this committee gets this but sometimes when things are classified, it tangles them up.?
