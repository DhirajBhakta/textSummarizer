They dont show their films before release to take opinions, and treat it as though theyre making a nuclear bomb. 
But who is going to give that opinion to them I totally agree with Ekta (Kapoor) when she threw him out from her film. 
You may be thinking you are making the Taj Mahal, but you are supposed to make it ready on time.
