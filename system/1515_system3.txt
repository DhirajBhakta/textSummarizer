Security at Delhi airport and Metro stations has been beefed up following intelligence input that seven terrorists have managed to get army uniform worn by personnel of captain and subedar rank. 
Apart from the airport and Metro stations, personnel on election duty in Punjab have also been asked to be on alert. 
In view of the Republic Day, we are maintaining the highest level of security and two additional layers of frisking have been added at the airport. 
At some points, CISF is asking women to remove jewellery before proceeding while some passengers are asked to open their baggage at the entry gate itself. 
We have also asked the airlines to start the Secondary Ladder Point Checking (SLPC) just before passengers enter the aircraft. 
s IGI airportSLPC is conducted when the threat is at its highest level and passengers have to go through complete frisking just before entering the aircraft.
