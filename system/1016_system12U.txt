The dominant view about the battle so far has been in favour of the Mughal army.But those who dispute the dominant view, including the revised history schoolbook, say that the Mughal armys failure in capturing or killing Maharana Pratap, its decision to not pursue Prataps army after he fled, and Akbars displeasure with his generals Man Singh and Asaf Khan prove that Pratap prevailed in the war.School education minister Vasudev Devnani had in March this year questioned Akbars victory asking why he attacked Mewar six times if he won the battle, and pronounced the Rajput king the victor.The history department of RU, in a meeting of its board of studies last month, decided to include Dr Chandra Shekhar Sharmas Rashtra-Ratna Maharana Pratap in the list of recommended readings in the paper Rajasthan Through the Ages in the second semester of MA History.Sharmas book, according to the minutes of the meeting, has a fresh interpretation of Maharana Pratap, and projects him as a great freedom fighter, besides projecting him as a victor in the battle of Haldighati.The board also decided to include a topic Debate on the outcome of the Battle of Haldighati in the topics to be covered under the paper.
