Every time I have sung from my heart and not thought about the commercial aspect, it has done really well for me. 
I think we underestimate the audience of our country or for that matter worldwide, by thinking that they don?
t like to think much about whether the film will be a success or not.?
I am not holding on to any thought if I should take up a project or not. 
It came from my heart that I should go independent from films. 
s a lot of scope for good music in films but sometimes, we are confined in that boundary to sing within the story narrative and because it is a film, there are a lot of constraints.
