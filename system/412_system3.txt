Earlier today, singer and television host Rimi Tomy was questioned in connection with the abduction and assault of a popular Malayalam actress. 
This comes after Dileep's wife and actress Kavya Madhavan was grilled by the police  on Wednesday. 
Reports suggest that Rimi might have had some financial dealings with actor Dileep. 
Pulsar Suni, the main accused in the case, wrote a letter to Dileep wherein he mentions 'Madam'. 
The Kerala police suspect Rimi Tomy's alleged involvement.According to a report in The News Minute, Rimi Tomy quashed the baseless reports and said she had no such dealings with Dileep. 
"I am not the 'madam' in this case. 
A police officer name Baiju Paulose called and enquired about some stage shows I'd done abroad. 
He said that police are aware that I have no connection with the case. 
It is painful to hear fake news about this on TV. 
Reporters, please clarify with me before putting out such news. 
I have no problems with the actor who was assaulted," she was quoted as saying.Earlier this month, actor Dileep was arrested on the charges of criminal conspiracy in the Malayalam actress case.
