Instead of fishing for cash in their pockets to donate at temples, devotees can use  mobile phones to transfer donations to the e-wallets of the holy places. 
Not being able to collect enough donations due to the cash crisis, temples in Indirapuram have provided the option of e-wallets. 
The priest at Shri Hanuman Balaji Temple in Gyan Khand-4 in Indirapuram has put up information on the donation box of the temple asking devotees to pay through Paytm. 
Money from community feasts (bhandara) used to be a major source of donations as one such feast would get us between Rs3,000 and Rs5,000.
