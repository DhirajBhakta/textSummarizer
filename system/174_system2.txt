Donald Trump hailed a great day at the White House following the removal of communications director Anthony Scaramucci after just 10 days in a move that has only increased the sense of chaos at the heart of the Trump administration.His evening tweet came as Scaramucci was forced out following a turbulent series of media appearances over the last week by the combative former Wall Street financier, capped by a foul-mouthed tirade to a New Yorker journalist on Thursday.His shock political demise was precipitated by the appointment of former US marine Gen John Kelly as Donald Trumps new chief of staff less than six hours earlier.Anthony Scaramucci will be leaving his role as White House communications director, said press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders in a statement on Monday afternoon.
