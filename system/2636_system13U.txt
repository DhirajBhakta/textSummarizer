Angad and Richa will be seen together in upcoming web series Inside Edge, which will have cricket as its backdrop.Asked about their sports interests, Angad, son of former cricketer Bishan Singh Bedi, said, "I have a sports background, so obviously I have followed sports from childhood. 
I have been following the India-West Indies cricket tour and now also Wimbledon has started, I have been following that as well."
