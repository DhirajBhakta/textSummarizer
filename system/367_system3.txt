Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar comfortably won a trust vote in the assembly on Friday, securing the support of 131 legislators including those of his new ally BJP, but insisted that his change of sides was for sewa and not mewa.Kumars fresh stint as the chief minister came two days after he surprised his former coalition partners, the RJD and Congress, to part ways and return to the BJP, his former ally with which he ran a previous coalition government till 2013.To be in power devolves great responsibility to govern, not earn. 
Yeh sewa ka Avsar hai, na ki mewa ka (It is an opportunity to serve, not profit, he said before seeking the trust vote.I faced lot of resistance trying to run the government in the best interest of people of Bihar and preserve the mahagathbandhan, but failed due to RJDs attitude, he said.He, however, added it was the mandate of Bihar and the responsibility to the people.The RJD-led opposition secured 108 votes. 
Two of the four independent legislators voted for Kumar in the House of 243.The RJD and Congress demand for a secret ballot was turned down by speaker Vijay Kumar Choudhary.After the speakers proposal for a voice vote was rejected, a lobby division method was opted for. 
Legislators went of the House and came back one by one and signed a register indicating their vote, for or against the motion.Before the vote, opposition leader and former deputy chief minister, Tejashwi Yadav, made an emotional speech, dismissing corruption charges against him were cooked up.I am young. 
Had that happened, I would not have been on the right side.If the RJD insists that the mandate was not followed, it should introspect, whether it was for the likes of Mohammad Shahabuddin and Rajballabh Yadav It is better now, that the government is in right hands, he said, referring to two controversial aides of Lalu.The new government will register fresh milestones in successful governance, which was lacking in the last regime due to RJDs intransigence, he added.
