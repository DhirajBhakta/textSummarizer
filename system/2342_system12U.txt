A group of five men allegedly broke open an ATM of Central Bank in Acharya Niketan market in east Delhis Pandav Nagar area on Friday, but had to flee without the money. 
The men allegedly covered the cameras installed inside the ATM with a cloth and started breaking the machine. 
While they were taking the cash tray out, two policemen on patrolling duty crossed the ATM and saw the men breaking the ATM open.
