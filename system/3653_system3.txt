The luxury shoe and bag retailer Jimmy Choo has put itself up for sale in a move that took the market by surprise.The retailer said it had decided to conduct a review of the various strategic options open to the company to maximise value for its shareholders and that it was seeking offers for the business.The move was backed by the companys independent directors and JAB Luxury, its majority shareholder with a stake of 68%.Shares in Jimmy Choo jumped 10% to a record high of 186.25p on the news, valuing the group at more than ?720m. 
The company floated on the stock market in 2014 at a price of 140p a share, valuing it at about ?550m.Any sale is expected to attract interest from strategic American buyers as well as Middle Eastern, Chinese and Russian bidders.The company was founded in London in 1996 by the Malaysian fashion designer Jimmy Choo and the then Vogue accessories editor Tamara Mellon. 
It has fared better than other luxury retailers such as Burberry, which were hit by Chinese tourists cutting back on luxury purchases.JAB, an investment company owned by Germanys billionaire Reimann family, wants to sell its stake in the shoes group to focus on food and other consumer goods. 
Remember what happened to Mulberry, another niche British luxury brand, when it drifted too far from its comfort zone One year sales were soaring, the next they were dropping amidst a spate of profit warnings.
