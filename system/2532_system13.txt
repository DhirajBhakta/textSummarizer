No official numbers of the total strength of PLA Army were released.Earlier, Chinese President Xi Jinping had announced that the PLA will be cut by three lakh troops.The total PLA personnel was about 2.3 million before the country announced a cut of 300,000 troops in 2015, state-run Global Times reported.This reform will provide other services, including the PLA Rocket Force, Air Force, Navy and Strategic Support Force (mainly responsible for electronic warfare and communication), with more resources and inputs, and the PLA will strengthen its capability to conduct overseas missions, Xu Guangyu, a senior adviser to the China Arms Control and Disarmament Association, was quoted by the media report.The PLA Daily article said that Chinas overseas interests were spread around the world and needed to be protected.These are beyond the armys current capabilities, Xu said.The PLA structure should also fit Chinas international status, Xu said.
