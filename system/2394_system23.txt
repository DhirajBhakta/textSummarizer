 The Kandivli police booked a man on Thursday for hurting religious sentiments over a comment he made on Facebook against Shiv Sena founder Bal Thackeray. 
While Ahmed Shaikh, a resident of a slum in Kandivli, has not been arrested, he was charged based on a complaint by one Lalsingh Rajpurohit, a builder. 
In his complaint to the police, Rajpurohit said he noticed Shaikhs derogatory comment on a friends Facebook post expressing outrage over the Amarnath yatra terror attack.
