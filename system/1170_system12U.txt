New Delhi, Feb 14 (PTI) A city-bound GoAir flight from Mumbai with over 180 people on board made an emergency landing here following engine trouble, but no one was hurt. 
This is the second incident involving a GoAir flight, where the plane had to make an emergency landing due to engine trouble. 
"Due to a technical snag in the air bleed system, the flight commander had to reduce the power of the left engine and he asked for emergency assistance during landing," the airline said.
