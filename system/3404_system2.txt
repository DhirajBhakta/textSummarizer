Washington, May 7 (PTI) Noise pollution caused by humans is pervasive in the US protected areas, posing a threat to land masses that harbour wildlife and provide places for respite, recreation, and natural resource conservation. 
"Although plants can not hear, many animals that disperse seeds or pollinate flowers can hear and are known to be affected by noise, resulting in indirect impacts on plants," said Buxton.
