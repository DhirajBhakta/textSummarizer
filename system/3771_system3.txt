Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has described as a must-watch and something that shakes one deeply a video put out by Aam Aadmi Party colleague Kumar Vishwas, who takes a swipe at the his own government over the issue of corruption.Still recovering from the humiliating defeat in the Rajouri Garden bypoll where the ruling party lost to the BJP and was pushed to a distant third, Kejriwal stepped in quickly to contain the damage the video could do in the run-up to the April 23 municipal elections, billed as a test of AAPs popularity.Reflecting on the state of the nation, Vishwas talks about a host of issues -- from Pakistan, Kashmir to corruption. 
But India is beyond this and will be there for thousands of years, Vishwas says, triggering talk of infighting in AAP.Kejriwal tweeted the video on Saturday, saying the video was wonderful and everyone should watch it.

Tomorrow media will say my wife has targeted me, Kejriwal said in an interview to CNN News 18, a clip of which was also retweeted by the CM.Defending his governments record on corruption, the chief minister said he had been ruthless and had sacked ministers, whenever credible evidence was put forward.Vishwas is one of the popular faces of AAP and is also on the list of the so-called star campaigners for the municipal elections but has so far stayed away from electioneering.
