Amid tension and division within the Opposition, Lalu Prasad has offered to consolidate Dalit votes by making a significant gesture: offer Mayawati a Rajya Sabha seat from Bihar, a day after the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief resigned in protest after she was not allowed to speak in the House.Lalu, who heads the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), tweeted from his handle, @laluprasadrjd: "Spoke with Mayawati Ji in (sic) length. 
Today would be remembered as a black day in the history when a highly respected Dalit leader was not allowed to raise the voice of poor in the Rajya Sabha," Lalu said on Tuesday, reacting to Mayawati's resignation."
