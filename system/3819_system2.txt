From Lalit K Jha Charlottesville (US), Apr 13 (PTI) To transform Indias economy, there is a need to reduce "friction" in businesses and create an "environment" wherein the government has more trust in its entrepreneurs, Infosys founder N R Narayana Murthy has said. 
We need to create an environment where the government has more trust in its entrepreneurs than it is today," Murthy, 70, told students of the prestigious Darden School of Business at the University of Virginia here. 
"Therefore, todays entrepreneurs would have to be much more nimble, global, competitive because market is truly determinant for success today unlike our time when managing government was a big determinant in India," he said.
