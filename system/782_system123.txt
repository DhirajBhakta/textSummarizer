The constitution does not explicitly prohibit self-pardons, but it has never been done before.The nearest precedent is supplied by Richard Nixon, who sought advice on the question as he faced the prospect of impeachment for obstruction of justice and abuse of power following the Watergate scandal in the early 1970s. 
Nixons personal lawyer advised him that he could pardon himself, but the justice department said he could not, according to Brian C Kalt, a law professor at Michigan State University whose recent book, Constitutional Cliffhangers, devotes a chapter to the issue.Nixon resigned and was eventually pardoned by his successor, president Gerald Ford."
