Los Angeles, Jan 8 (PTI) In a bizarre incident, an American woman living near an airport thought a massive bird had splattered her car with droppings only to realise that it was a plane that had dumped human waste on her property. 
Bethany Bowker, from West Jordan, Utah, left to pick up her children from school when she noticed the foul-smelling feces scattered all over her driveway and her car.
