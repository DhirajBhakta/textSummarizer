Veteran actor Amol Palekar filed a PIL with Supreme Court questioning the censorship laws that have not been contested for over 47 years now. 
Palekar has further challenged the provisions of the Cinematography Act, calling the pre-censorship of films irrelevant in the internet era. 
The Supreme Court has now issued a notice to the censor board asking them to file a reply to Palekar's plea.Palekar has been missing from silver screen for quite some time now.
