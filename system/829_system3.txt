North Delhi Mayor Preety Agarwal said the redevelopment of the Town Hall in Chandni Chowk -- the headquarters of the erstwhile unified MCD -- into a centre of cultural and social heritage would be taken up on a PPP model. 
Gupta said apart from depicting the history of Delhi, the redevelopment project is also expected to earn good revenue for the corporation. 
The mayor said the museum would be the main tourist attraction and it would occupy an area of about 1,574 sqm on the ground floor.
