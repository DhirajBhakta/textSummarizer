Commenting on the outcome of the GST Council meeting that concluded today, CAIT Secretary General Praveen Khandelwal said that classification of goods under different tax slabs of GST are by and large fitted in the correct basket and it is expected that goods will become cheaper under the new indirect tax regime. 
"However, on the other side, several items which have been placed under higher category of tax rate will disturb the pricing structure and pinch the common man," said B C Bhartia, president of the Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT).
