A day after BJP president Amit Shah addressed a public meeting at the Goa airport complex, a lawyer-activist has filed a complaint against party chief and Manohar Parrikar terming the meet as "gross abuse of power". 
All arrangements were made even as Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), which is entrusted with security of all Indian Airports, allegedly behaved indifferently.Union minister Sripad Naik, local party chief Vinay Tendulkar and minister Mauvin Godinho were present in the public meeting.
