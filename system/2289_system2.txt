t believe in analytics, I believe in living my life. 
If I start spending time  analysing my choices, I will not be able to live my life. 
If I believe had I failed after Shootout At Lokhandwala (2007),  then I wouldn?
I have a role for you in my film? 
I have never believed that characters are negative or positive, white or grey. 
Anything that I find interesting, I become that person and then it?
In the initial stages of my career I did a lot of experiments. 
I did Company and lived in slums for it and researched. 
After I would finish shooting for a film, it would be a little difficult to shake the character off  but now after my shoot I believe that you have to shake it off otherwise it starts becoming a part of you,?
