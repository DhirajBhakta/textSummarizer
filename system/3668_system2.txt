London, Apr 23 (PTI) A fur coat worn by a first class stewardess when the Titanic sank in 1912 has been sold for 150,000 pounds at an auction in the UK, almost double its original valuation of 80,000 pounds. 
More than 1,500 passengers and crew died when the ship sank in April 1912, on its maiden voyage. 
She put on the beaver lamb fur coat she owned to keep her warm as she boarded lifeboat, the Telegraph reported. 
Bennett died aged 96 in 1974 and was the longest living female member of the crew. 
The fur coat and letter of provenance went under the hammer yesterday at an auction at Henry Aldridge and Son in Devizes, Wiltshire.
