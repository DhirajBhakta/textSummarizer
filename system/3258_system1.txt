We just focus on the symptom, which is the people we see at our borders, said Jan Egeland, secretary general of the Norwegian Refugee Council.He said there is a link with refugees  though the vast majority of displaced people do not have the opportunity or means to cross borders.Six of the 10 countries that produced the most refugees in 2015  Afghanistan, Colombia, DRC, South Sudan and Syria  were also among the 10 with the largest number of internally displaced people.Egeland warned that without political intervention the situation will only get worse.
