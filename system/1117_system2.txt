New Delhi, Feb 17 (PTI) The statement of Nathuram Godse, along with other relevant records related to the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi, should be "proactively disclosed" on the website of the National Archives, the CIC has ruled. 
Information Commissioner Sridhar Acharyulu said, "One may disagree with Nathuram Godse and his co-accused but we cannot refuse disclosure or circulation of his opinion. 
Petitioner Ashutosh Bansal had demanded the charge sheet and Godses statement, among other details, from Delhi Police which forwarded the application to the National Archives of India (NAI), saying the records have been handed over to it. 
Although neither Delhi Police nor the National Archives cited any objection on the disclosure of the information, Acharyulu said that the information sought does not attract any of the exemption clauses. 
He said since the information is more than 20-years-old, it cannot be withheld unless it attracts section 8(1)(a) of the RTI Act which prohibits disclosure of information that prejudicially affects security of the State or relations with foreign countries.
