My break was only ten months - I didn't shoot a film for 10 months. 
I could hold on to that great work in the beginning and confidently come back with a film two years later.So did you use those 10 months to reassess your career and bring about a change?
Even when I watch a film, I feel like I want to wear that skirt, have that hair and have a Raj (in my life). 
I definitely want to do an action film. 
I really wanted to do a comedy and I'm doing Golmaal.You are juggling promoting Meri Pyaari Bindu and shooting Golmaal 4. 
When Rohit Sir called, I knew I want to do this film; I'm doing this film.
