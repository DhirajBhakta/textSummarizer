Even when I watch a film, I feel like I want to wear that skirt, have that hair and have a Raj (in my life). 
People don't think of that.Is your approach to picking roles different from before I definitely feel more responsible towards entertaining the audience. 
When Rohit Sir called, I knew I want to do this film; I'm doing this film.
