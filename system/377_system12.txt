The commission issued a circular on Wednesday, asking all the higher educational institutes to take steps to prevent ragging and warned them of punitive action if they failed to take action against those found guilty. 
If an institution fails to take adequate steps to prevent ragging or does not act in accordance with these regulations or fails to punish perpetrators suitably, it will attract punitive action by the UGC, reads the circular issued by Jaspal S Sandhu, secretary, UGC.So far, as many as 288 ragging-related complaints have been received by the anti-ragging call centre.
