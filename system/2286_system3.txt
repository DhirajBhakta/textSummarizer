The Maharashtra Prohibition of People from Social Boycott (Prevention Prohibition and Redressal) Act prescribes a maximum punishment of three year in jail and a fine of Rs1lakh. 
After the Presidents assent, the Maharashtra government published the Act in the gazette. 
The Act has been cleared by the Central government. 
The Act also has a provision to withdraw cases with the consent of victims and permission from a court. 
We believe the Act is a tribute to Narendra Dabholkar, who had started the fight.READUnfortunate that cops ignored testimony: Hamid DabholkarDabholkar murder: CBI to produce Tawade in court on June 16
