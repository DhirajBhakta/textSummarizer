Infantino said the money will be reinvested in football; he has promised all Fifas 211 member countries associations $5m a year to aid development.Speaking after the meeting, Infantino argued that the expanded tournament will increase interest in football worldwide by involving more countries, while not burdening players with more matches.Responding robustly to criticism from the German football association (DFB) and European Club Association (ECA), which derided Fifas decision as having been taken for political reasons rather than sporting ones, Infantino said: We are in the 21st century, and we should shape the World Cup for the 21st century.
