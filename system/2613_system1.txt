Nitish, who was in an alliance with the BJP for 17 years, has been giving political signals of getting closer to the BJP.Surgical strikes on Pakistan and demonetisation have been a few instances where Nitish has been the lone opposition face to come out and openly extend his support to PM Modi, much to the discomfort of the Opposition, especially RJD chief Lalu Prasad with whose support he is running a coalition government in Bihar.Even in the presidential election, Nitish has decided to support NDA nominee Ram Nath Kovind and not the opposition's candidate Meira Kumar.
