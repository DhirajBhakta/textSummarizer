Actor Nayanthara too slammed the director for his sexist comments. 
She was quoted by Sify as saying, "How can a responsible person from film industry make such a crass and cheap comment? 
Who is Suraj to say such a derogatory statement against heroines? 
Does he think that heroines are strippers who will come and shed their clothes just because they are paid money? 
Will he dare to speak such things about working women in his family?"
Tamannaah took to Twitter and lashed out at Suraaj. pic.twitter.com/OEn8OfgZ0Z
