The BMC has proposed a 300-acre park to be built through reclamation in Cuffe Parade in the Development Plan (DP) 2034. 
The park would include a garden, playground and play area for children. 
Damodar Tandel, president of the association, said the fishermen use the area to park around 400 boats. 
The Mumbai Metropolitan Regional Development Authority (MMRDA) has also marked plots 139 to 142 in the area as machimaar nagar and 143-145 as parking space for boats in its regional plan, Tandel said. 
The BMC says it wants to increase green cover in the city by creating a theme park. 
Their plan is to destroy the sea by reclaiming to increase green cover? 
BMC officials also said they will make use of the muck generated out of the Metro-III project.
