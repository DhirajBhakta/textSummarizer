About 50 Congress workers in Mumbai got a tattoo on their hand which reads "huamara pradhan mantri rishwatkhor hain." 
We wanted to question PM Modi on Saturday when he was on a visit to Mumbai about the allegations levelled against him by Rahul Gandhi, but police kept us under house arrest. 
Rahul asked him about the money that he received from big business houses but PM doesn't want to answer and thus we have decided on these temporary tattoos.
