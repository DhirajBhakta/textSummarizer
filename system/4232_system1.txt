Rarely has a domestic match at this venue grabbed such attendance, but with Former India skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni at the centre, all the commotion was expected. 
With Vidarbha managing just 159, the crowd at the Air Force Sports Complex in Palam was waiting for their hero to come out to bat. 
Every time a batsman got out, the crowd started chanting 'Dhoni Dhoni' but the Jharkhand skipper wouldn't oblige. 
There were other batsmen who needed the batting practice much more than the senior pro. 
Many were sitting close to the boundary ropes while many were trying to catch a glimpse of action from the boundary wall adjacent to the main road.
