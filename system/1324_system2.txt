It is a moment that is seared on to the consciousness of Frank Lampard and every Chelsea fan ? 
The highlight, surely, was the Champions League final in 2012, when he captained Chelsea, in the absence of the suspended John Terry, to the penalty shootout victory against Bayern Munich.Now, Lampard is finished. 
He was excellent at Euro 2004, scoring three times as England reached the quarter-finals but his subsequent tournament appearances at the World Cups of 2006, 2010 and 2014 were disappointments.Lampard missed his penalty in the quarter-final shootout defeat against Portugal in 2006 and, four years later, his glorious shot in the last?16 against Germany bounced off the crossbar and over the line ? 
He says the two at Bolton were his best with the one he scored for Chelsea at Aston Villa in 2013, which took him past Bobby Tambling?
s all-time record for the club, not far behind.When Lampard left Chelsea in 2014 to finish his career at Manchester City and New York City, he did so with 211 goals from 649 appearances for them.
