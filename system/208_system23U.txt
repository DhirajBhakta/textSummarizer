The state environment department is drawing up a plan to properly dispose of tonnes of road dust that is collected by mechanical sweepers every day.The city has more than a dozen mechanical sweepers which keeps the road free of dust. 
More such vehicles are being procured by both the civic bodies and the PWD.There is, however, no proper mechanism or standard operating procedure on how to dump the dust collected so that they dont return to the city after disposal, said a senior official of the state public works department.Road dust is one of the major contributors to the particulate pollutants in Delhis air.
