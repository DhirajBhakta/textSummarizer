The petition had garnered 193 (out of required 200) signatures till Saturday.Hindustan Times had on July 6 highlighted that more than 1,700 trees may be felled to make way for a integrated exhibition-cum-convention centre at Pragati Maidan, according to the reply of an RTI query. 
While more than 6,000 were cut in 2014-15, around 4,600 and 4,700 trees were felled in 2015-16 and 2016-17.The petition on change.org says that tree felling will be done right in the heart of the city with several schools, hospitals and residential areas in the vicinity. 
These areas, along with the rest of Delhi-NCR, will suffer from the resulting pollution, that will only worsen. 
Over the last 3 years , Delhi has already lost 15,000 trees to development and we cannot afford to lose any more, it says.Do you feel embarrassed and worried to be living in the most polluted city on our planet... 
Are you concerned about your and your dear ones health due to Delhis consistently hazardous levels of air quality ... 
On paper it is there but doesnt meet or act.
