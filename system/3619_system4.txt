London, Apr 26 (PTI) A giant rabbit, destined to be the worlds biggest bunny, died mysteriously on a United Airlines flight to the US, the latest in a slew of public relations nightmares faced by the beleaguered American airline recently. 
Ive sent rabbits around the world before and nothing like this happened," Simons breeder Annette Edwards was quoted as saying. 
Edwards said Simon was healthy when placed in the cargo hold. 
Ive sent rabbits all around the world and nothing like this has happened before," Edwards said. 
"After the viral video, no-one wanted responsibility for killing what was to be the worlds biggest rabbit," the source said, referring to the controversy United Airlines was embroiled in after a passenger was forcibly removed from plane earlier this month.
