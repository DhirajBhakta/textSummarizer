Just days after being declared bankrupt, Boris Becker suffered another blow when his cars were towed from outside a private club in London earlier this week.According to a report in the Daily Mail, Becker has been slapped with two parking tickets after he left his Porsche Cayenne GTS and his Electric Blue Maserati GHIBLI S outside his South Kensington private member's club.The former German tennis star Becker was declared bankrupt by a court in London after failing to pay a "substantial" long-standing debt since 2015.Lawyers for the the three-time Wimbledon champion pleaded with a Bankruptcy Court registrar last week to allow Becker a "last chance" to pay off the debt.But Registrar Christine Derrett, who recalled watching Becker play on Centre Court, ruled there was a lack of credible evidence the outstanding payment would be forthcoming and refused to adjourn the case."
