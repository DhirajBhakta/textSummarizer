The moustache is still there and will be for centuries, he said.Once the last visitors of the day had left the museum, the 1.5-tonne stone slab that rests above his grave was lifted so experts could get to his body to take hair, nails and two large bones.The biological specimens have been taken from Salvador Dal?s remains, Catalonias high court said in a statement before midnight local time.It said Dalis coffin had been opened at 10.20pm so work could begin.To guard the artists posthumous privacy, awnings were put up around the museum to stop drones recording the exhumation.The DNA recovered from the remains will be compared with samples from Maria Pilar Abel, who claims to be the result of a liaison her mother had with Dal? in 1955.Abel has been seeking to prove her parentage for the past 10 years and says the physical resemblance to the surrealist painter is so strong, the only thing Im missing is a moustache.She says it was an open secret in her family that the artist was her biological father.She told the Spanish newspaper El Pa?s that she first learned of her true paternity from the woman she said she had thought was her paternal grandmother.
