You have heard about Mahendra Singh Dhoni's crazy fan Ram Babu. 
I watch matches at Visakhapatnam, Cuttack, Ranchi, Kolkata and sometimes in Punjab," Nikash told IANS on the eve of the tie.Like Sudhir and Ram, Nikash has also renounced a lot for the love of the game and his hero Kohli, one of the world's finest batsmen at the moment."
I do not have the finances to travel across India but I want to watch every game our country plays. 
I have shunned the daily household chores and my responsibilities for this and my favourite Virat Kohli.
