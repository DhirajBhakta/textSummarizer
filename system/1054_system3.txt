Billed as a citadel of Maharashtra's Shiv Sena, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) might be on course to welcome the BJP as an equally powerful - if not more - stakeholder in its governance, exit polls showed.The Shiv Sena fielded candidates on all 227 BMC wards across the metropolis for Tuesday's elections. 
Besides, the MNS contested 201 wards, the NCP 171, the BSP 109, the Samajwadi Party 76 and the Hyderabad-based AIMIM 56.Partners in the central and state governments, the Shiv Sena and the BJP opposed each other on the BMC turf because of various factors, including differences over seat-sharing.Exit polls conducted by Axis-My-India after Tuesday's elections indicated both parties secured a vote share of 32 percent each.
