European footballs governing body, Uefa, decided in 2008 to expand its tournament from 16 countries to 24, and Europes representatives on Fifas council supported the World Cup increase, despite the opposition from leading clubs.In a statement the ECA, which has 220 member clubs in 53 European countries, said that the 32 team format is a perfect formula and suggested that Infantino had in mind electoral support from Fifas member associations, which each vote for for the president. 
Last week the DFB president, Reinhard Grindel, expressed immense reservations about the proposed expansion, arguing that allowing 16 more countries to qualify would reduce the quality of the football.Referring to his election last February on a proposal to expand the World Cup to 40 teams, Infantino said the prime objection from European clubs had been to increasing the number of matches played, and the tournaments length. 
Infantino pointed out that Uefas expansion lengthened the European Championship by a week, and incorporated one more match for the finalists.Arguing that the quality of football is improving around the world, and pointing to the elimination of both England and Italy by Costa Rica in the last World Cup in 2014, Infantino said: Increasing the size of teams which can participate will increase the investment in football development, to make sure that the teams can qualify.The FAs chief executive, Martin Glenn, had said his preference was to keep the tournament smaller, but he acknowledged that smaller countries understandably want to be part of the tournament.
