Former minister Kapil Mishra was beaten up by fellow AAP MLAs inside the Delhi Assembly today as he tried to raise slogans against CM Arvind Kejriwal and health minister Satyendra Jain.
My fight against these corrupt leaders will continue," Mishra said.? Mishra, who served as Water Supply minister, was removed from the post after he claimed that he has evidence to show that Arvind Kejriwal and his cabinet colleague Satyendra Jain were involved in corruption.
