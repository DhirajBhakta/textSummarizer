If you still don't have a Reliance Jio SIM, now is a good time to get one for two reasons, you will get free 4G internet till March 31 and that you can get the Jio SIM delivered to your doorstep. 
Snapdeal has sent out an email to select customers saying that it will now home-deliver Jio SIM cards. 
Those who received the email can enter details and time when and where they want the SIM to be delivered.The mailer says that Snapdeal will choose their premium customers for this Jio home delivery service. 
The eKYC verification will be done at that time only.While this sounds like a good deal, we don't know how Snapdeal is going to decide who is a premium customer and who is not.
