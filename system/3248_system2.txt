New Delhi, May 23 (PTI) In a major relief to students who have just taken Class 12 examinations, the Delhi High Court today directed the CBSE to follow its moderation policy of giving grace marks to students for difficult questions. 
The court asked the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) to continue with the policy which was in place when the examination forms were submitted last year. 
A bench of Acting Chief Justice Gita Mittal and Justice Pratibha M Singh passed the interim order on a PIL filed by a parent and a lawyer contending that the policy should not be done away with this year, as decided by some states, since it would affect the students of Class 12, particularly those who have applied for admissions abroad. 
The petition had said that the policy was changed by way of a notification by CBSE after the exams for the year were held and hence would have a drastic impact on the students.
