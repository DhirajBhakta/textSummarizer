Bob Dylan made history last October by being named the first songwriter to win the prestigious Nobel Prize for Literature. 
The Swedish Academy expects the winners to deliver a lecture or speech, and collect their Nobel in person. 
This, Dylan still hasn't been able to do.A speech by Dylan was given by the US Ambassador to Sweden in December, during the annual Nobel Awards dinner, but the Academy has ruled that that is not enough. 
And if the lecture or speech is not given by Dylan in person by June this year, he'll have to forfeit his award.Now before you jump the gun and start lamenting about the huge loss this could be, here's the good news. 
Bob Dylan has two concerts scheduled in Sweden, and has assured the Academy that he will meet them this coming weekend in Stockholm.Also read: This is 'truly beyond words', Bob Dylan says in his Nobel Prize speechAccording to a BBC report, Prof Sara Danius (the permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy) announced that "the Swedish Academy and Bob Dylan have decided to meet this weekend."
