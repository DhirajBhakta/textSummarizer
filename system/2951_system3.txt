But as far as Randy (Orton), I just want to say that he is a 14-time WWE champion and he made a rookie mistake. 
He has someone in the ring like me...I'm a dangerous dangerous competitor and he turned his back on me and that's exactly why he lost and why I'm the champion," he said.The 30-year-old also said that his aim is to win the most number of titles in the history of the WWE."
I'm only getting better every week...every week I improve in the ring and I intend on being a long time champion.
