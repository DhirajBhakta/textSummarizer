The United States has accused China and Russia of bearing unique and special responsibility for North Koreas belligerent pursuit of nuclear weapons, after Pyongyang tested its latest ballistic missile.North Korea conducted its second intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) test late on Friday in what it called a warning to the beast-like US imperialists. 
Bonnie Glaser, the director of the China power project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) thinktank in Washington, said Kim Jong-uns latest test  of a missile some experts said had the capacity to reach New York  would increase Chinese fears of a US strike against the North.
