Panda's allegation created ripples in the House after she was given an opportunity to speak on the issue of security personnel asking girls and women to remove black odhani (stole) before allowing them to attend a government programme attended by the chief minister in Sundergarh district on December 4. 
"Even a woman was asked to remove her black petticoat to attend the CM's meeting held earlier at Bargarh," Panda alleged adding that she came to know about the incident of November 25 from media reports.
