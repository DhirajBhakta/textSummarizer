In the latest twist to David Guetta's controversial three-city India tour, event organizers announced that the the French DJ's Mumbai concert, initially cancelled, has now been rescheduled to January 15. 
Guetta is set to perform tonight in Hyderabad following which he will perform two shows on Sunday - the rescheduled Mumbai concert, which will take place in the morning, and another one in Delhi, which will be held as per schedule, beginning at 4pm. 
Bengaluru police fired back saying permission for the event had never been issued, adding that the organizers approached them for permission just two days before the concert date.
