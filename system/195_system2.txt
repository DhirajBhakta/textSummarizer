Angelina Jolie says accounts of her casting process for children to appear in her film First They Killed My Father are false and upsetting. 
Jolie co-wrote and directed the film, which she talked about in a recent Vanity Fair profile.The article described a scene in which casting directors in their attempt to find a child actor to play the lead role presented money to impoverished children only to take it away from them as an acting exercise.Jolie and producer Rithy Panh issued joint statements Sunday responding to the outrage and refuting claims that the production was exploitative through a representative from Netflix, which is producing and distributing the film.?
