From Seema Hakhu Kachru Houston, Jan 13 (PTI) In a heartwarming open letter to Sasha and Malia Obama, former first daughters Barbara Bush and Jenna Bush Hager shared a bit of advice to the girls as they join "another rarified club, one of former First Children". 
Seen so much," the Bush sisters write, noting Malia and Sashas meeting with Nelson Mandela in the cell where he was imprisoned for decades, as well as trips with their mother to Liberia and Morocco to speak with girls about the importance of education. 
The Bush sisters stress to 15-year-old Sasha, and 18-year-old Malia, that there is much to look forward to, but urge them to keep close in their hearts the experiences of the past two terms. 
As most of the world knows, we did," they say, a nod to the much-reported brushes with the law both Bush twins experienced while drinking underage.
