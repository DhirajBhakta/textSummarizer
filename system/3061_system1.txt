Paleontologists from Chinese Academy of Sciences began the excavation in late May, following the discovery of dinosaur fossils last year at Longshan Mountain in the city of Yanji in Jilin Province. 
The fossil was well preserved from head to tail, with clear skin, which is quite rare among Cretaceous strata findings in China, they said. 
Archaeologists also found a large amount of teeth, arm, pelvis and rib bones belonging to at least six different dinosaurs, most of which were in good condition, Xinhua reported.
