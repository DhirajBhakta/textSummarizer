What I want to know is, who is paying for this extravagance, asks Nihalani, and adds, It is our foreign exchange being squandered as every top star is given tickets for his spouse, children, parents , ayahs, bodyguards, friends, friends of friends .. 
Ive heard stars are even given money to shop.Who is paying for all this IIFA is selling Indian cinema to various countries and probably getting many financial benefits.
