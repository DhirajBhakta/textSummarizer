Producer and CBFC chairperson Pahlaj Nihalani is not a fan of the International Indian Films Academy (IIFA) awards. 
Nihalani says many actors who were taken to New York did not even attend? 
It is our foreign exchange being squandered as every top star is given tickets for his spouse, children, parents , ayahs, bodyguards, friends, friends of friends .?. 
ve heard stars are even given money to shop.Who is paying for all this? 
IIFA is selling Indian cinema to various countries and probably getting many financial benefits. 
I think the day Mr Bachchan opted out, IIFA lost its dignity and relevance. 
In 18 years, how much global impact has Indian cinema made and what hand did IIFA have in this??
