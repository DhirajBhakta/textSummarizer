The idols were kept on the ground floor of the building,? 
said Manish Saxena, the station house officer of Surajpur police station.The thieves apparently used screw drivers to remove screws of window grill and gain entry into the temple, Saxena said.Shri Chaitanya Das, a youth preacher at the centre said the idols of Gaura and Nitai were missing from the sanctum when the devotees woke up in the morning.Das said, ?
Generally all the devotees sleep on the first floor of the building and the ground floor, where the idols were kept, is left empty during night.
