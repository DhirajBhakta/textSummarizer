A statement from the defence department confirmed that the spy ship had remained outside Australias territorial waters but had entered its exclusive economic zone.However, they said the ships presence did not interfere with the operation of Talisman Sabre.The three-week training exercise in central Queensland has involved more than 33,000 personnel from Australia, the United States, New Zealand, Japan and Canada.
