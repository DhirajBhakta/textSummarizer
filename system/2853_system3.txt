With school and college admissions being the flavour of season, doctors of city's top government hospitals are battling a rush of people with requests for issuance of disability certificates.Demands for disability certificates by parents and students come shortly after the Union government revised the disability act and made it mandatory for government hospitals to issue a differently -abled certificate. 
It is a complete misuse," said a senior psychiatrist at RML requesting anonymity.Dr Smita Desphande, who heads the department of Psychiatry at RML Hospital told Mail Today, "Our department has been getting at least 10 cases each day, wherein parents ask for disability certificate for their child to get admission done under the disability quota. 
Mostly, requests come for students of private schools and colleges.ANYTHING FOR MARKS"Parents know disability certificates would fetch their kids marks, even if the spelling is wrong, and would allot them extra time during exams. 
Often they come to us saying, 'My child does not want to take up Science, so make the certificate according to requirements," said a doctor."
We have a specific tool to calculate the percentage of disability in a child. 
Teachers, according to experts and doctors, are unaware of disability norms.RML doctors said parents are misguided by school teachers often."
