"This will prove to be a safe place for orphaned, abandoned and surrendered children," said a senior ministry official.After a hospital or orphanage is notified by the ringing bell, officials will take the child into custody and he or she will handed over to the area's child welfare committee. 
The "surrendered children" fail to get registered under the adoption list and in the process bring down the number of children ideal for the purpose.The official added the ministry will prioritise adoption demands by single mothers as well as economically welloff mothers and women who are over child- bearing age.
