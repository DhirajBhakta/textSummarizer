Tiwari, who was on a visit to the Inderpuri slums this New Year's Eve, met the woman who came to the BJP president alleging that "politicians never listened to the problems of the poor". straight talk, Tiwari assured her of a "solution" and it surprised many when he declared Kaushik as the BJP's candidate from the local municipal ward. 
BJP leaders refused to comment on the assets declared by its candidate but said its pick was aimed at supporting the less-privileged.
