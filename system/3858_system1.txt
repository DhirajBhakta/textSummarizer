AAP found ammunition to gun for the BJP on Monday after it emerged that the saffron party's Inderpuri candidate for this month's municipal polls, who was touted as a slum dweller and the face of the city's urban poor, happens to be a millionaire. 
The BJP went on the defensive after she told the state election commission in an affidavit that she has assets worth Rs 1.35 crore, including three residential houses in west Delhi. 
Aam Aadmi Party spokesperson Dilip Pandey termed the BJP's support for the slum dwellers and residents of unauthorised colonies in Delhi "hypocrisy" and "fake". 
Tiwari, who was on a visit to the Inderpuri slums this New Year's Eve, met the woman who came to the BJP president alleging that "politicians never listened to the problems of the poor". straight talk, Tiwari assured her of a "solution" and it surprised many when he declared Kaushik as the BJP's candidate from the local municipal ward.
