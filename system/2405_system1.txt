The next time you spot actor Kalki Koechlin, don?
The actor is apparently fed up of fans coming to her with the phone cameras in selfie mode. 
This trend of taking selfies is really extreme. 
I wish people were more keen to talk to you, instead of taking a selfie. 
We are obsessed with this selfie culture. 
says Kalki, who was last seen in actor Konkona Sen Sharma?
s directorial debut A Death in the Gunj.Fans are a big part of an actor?
However, when it comes to socially relevant topics, Kalki feels that it?
It has to be a collective decision, which needs to come from everyone.
