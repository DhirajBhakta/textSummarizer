The decision comes after the Noida authoritys traffic cell found out that 80% of road markings in the city are either washed away or fade out on their own. 
The traffic police recently installed close circuit television cameras (CCTVs) at intersections in Sector 57/22 and Sector 2/19 for better traffic management. 
We hope to finish the road marking work very soon in order to enable the traffic police to penalise violators, Chandra said.
