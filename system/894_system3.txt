The House has voted more than 60 times to repeal or alter the ACA, but most of those votes were also merely symbolic.On Tuesday, the Arkansas senator Tom Cotton told the conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt: I dont see how any Republican senator who voted just 18 months ago for this very piece of legislation could now flip-flop 18 months on with Obamacare still inflicting so much harm on Americans, and the fact that we campaigned on this for four straight elections.As recently as January, however, Cotton himself warned against repealing the healthcare law without a replacement.Trumps arrival on the scene upended the party.
