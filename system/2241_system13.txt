Towards this, the total annual expenditure to maintain these six tiger reserves was just about Rs 23 crore.A very crass economic cost benefit analysis suggests that the return on investment for saving each tiger is of the order 356 times the investment.No industry or service can boast of such a high rate of return.This new way of green accounting is seldom considered by traditional economists, says Rajesh Gopal, former head of Project Tiger and currently Secretary-General of the Global Tiger Forum in New Delhi.India is currently home to 60 per cent of the worlds tigers and through the establishment of 50 tiger reserves, the numbers of adult tigers living in the wild has been steadily increasing from a low of 1,411 tigers in 2006 to reaching a peak of 2,226 in 2015 when the last estimate was made.The next countrywide census will be carried out in 2018.Making a case for increased investments for tiger conservation, Gopal says, In the last 35 years of tiger conservation in India, the government has spent close to Rs 1,200 crore or about USD 180 million and the simple stock benefits from the six tiger reserves that have been analysed comes to USD 23,056 million per year.This is an eye opener.Today, 2.3 per cent of the geographical area of the country is covered under protected tiger reserves and to drive home his point of economic benefits Gopal says some 300 small and big rivers originate from the protected forests, whose downstream benefits are invaluable.Gopal, who is a co-author of this unique study, says estimating the anthropocentric benefits of a natural ecosystem is almost impossible as there are many-many intangible benefits.To expand the same, Verma adds, We still do not have adequate information or understanding about ecosystems, all the species, and the various ways in which these enhance human well-being that we can objectively estimate a value for each of them.There are also ethical issues inherent in the process, the intrinsic value i.e., the value of wild species in their own right.However, he says recognition of even a conservative estimate of some of these intangible benefits from tiger reserves is likely to demonstrate their significance and provide adequate justification for conservation of these tiger habitats.
