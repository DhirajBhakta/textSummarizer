According to testimony of BhakyaSri's neighbours, they saw the staff of the treatment centre drop off the freezer box on June 3. 
To add to their plight, the parents had to face blatant apathy at the Coimbatore General Hospital, where they were asked to pay Rs 3,000 as bribe to collect BhakyaSri's body from the morgue. 
Clash between the family members of BhakyaSri and Balaji broke out when he visited the family at the Coimbatore hospital.
