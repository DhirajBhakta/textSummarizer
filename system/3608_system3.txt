London, Apr 26 (PTI) Scientists have discovered what may be the worlds oldest fungus in South African rocks dating back 2.4 billion years. 
The fossils suggest that fungus may have evolved from under the deep sea rather than land. 
If not a fungus, the organism could be from an extinct branch of life that has not been described before, scientists say. 
"The deep biosphere where the fossils were found represents a significant portion of the Earth, but we know very little about its biology and even less about its evolutionary history," said Stefan Bengtson of the Swedish Museum of Natural History in Sweden who led the research team. 
The fossils closely resemble those found in similar conditions on land. 
They are made up of jumbles of tangled threads some hundredths of a millimetre thick.
