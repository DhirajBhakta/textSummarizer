Private hospitals and malls in the city are misusing their basement areas to carry out commercial activities, according to replies to RTI queries by city residents.In building plans, basements are approved as parking spaces of the establishments, including hospitals. 
said in a RTI reply that basements are being used for labs and offices in many hospitals.In the absence of parking areas, vehicles are parked on roads in a city that already has limited public parking spaces.An RTI query in this regard was filed in November by Gurgaon resident Aseem Takyar. 
Vivek Kalia, estate officer II of Huda, Gurgaon, said in the reply.The roads leading to these important hospitals are always packed with vehicles, alleged Takyar, adding that the space should be freed to provide easy access in case of an emergency.Last Thursday, Bhure Lal, chairman of the Environment Pollution Control Authority (EPCA), had also asked the district administration to take effective steps to remove roadside parking and make it mandatory for every establishment to have parking facility inside the premises. ?
