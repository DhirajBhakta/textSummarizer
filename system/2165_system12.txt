Even as he agrees that one cannot deny the existence of nepotism in Bollywood, filmmaker Neeraj Ghaywan, who bagged the National Award for his debut film Masaan, believes the issue has been blown out of proportion.I think the issue (of nepotism) is overblown and has turned pointless now. 
But beyond that, there isnt much to say, the filmmaker told Hindustan Times.Richa Chadha in a still from Masaan.Talking about his favourite actors, Neeraj said, Deepika Padukone and Ranbir Kapoor are two actors I would like to work with.
