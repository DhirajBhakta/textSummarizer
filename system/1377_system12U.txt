Iran indicated it could bar entry to US citizens in response to a move by US President Donald Trump, who signed an executive order temporarily barring most arrivals from seven Muslim-majority countries. 
Iran said Trump's wide-ranging order, which was signed on Friday, among other things, prevents most travelers from Libya, Sudan, Somalia, Syria, Iraq, Iran and Yemen from entering the US, was insulting and that it would respond in kind while the restrictions are in place.Calling Trump's decision "an open affront against the Iranian nation and the Muslim world", the Iranian Foreign Ministry said the measure would backfire and promote more violence and extremism.
