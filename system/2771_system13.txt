The midnight launch of the GST is an insult to 1947," senior Congress leader Anand Sharma told Rajdeep Sardesai at India Today's Midnight Conclave being held at New Delhi's Hotel Taj Mansingh.On the night of August 14, Jawaharlal Nehru had made his famous 'tryst with destiny' speech in the Central Hall of Parliament, which effectively announced the independence of India from the British.It was for this reason, Sharma said, that the NDA government's decision to announce a tax reform through a special midnight session of Parliament is a "publicity stunt".
