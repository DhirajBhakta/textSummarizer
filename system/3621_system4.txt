@emirates I think one of the @emirates staff was being racist.. 
I fly @emirates regularly n this is 1st time I have come across this kind of attitudeRecently, the Baahubali team including Rajamouli, Prabhas, Rana Anushka and Shobu were in Dubai to promote their much-anticipated Baahubali: The Conclusion. 
When the team headed back to Hyderabad, Shobu alleed that his team faced unfair treatment by one of the Emirates staff. 
He was surprised since he flew Emirates regularly came across this kind of attitude for the first time.Baahubali 2 is scheduled to release in Telugu, Malayalam, Tamil and Hindi on April 28, and currently the final leg of promotion is underway.
