Although actor Kriti Sanon is just three films old, she has already been directed by some of the best filmmakers and co-starred with actors such as Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol. 
There were some low phases in my life; there were films offered by big banners, but they were not the best debut projects. 
There were also times when I met a few people who told me that something was not right about me ? 
I think I did feel low, but at the same time, I did have people who believed in me a lot. 
Neither of them has ever accepted it publicly, and Kriti says that negative stories do affect her.?
