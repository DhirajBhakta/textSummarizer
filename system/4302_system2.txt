Launching a scathing attack on Jawaharlal Nehru, BJP MP Subramanian Swamy told a packed house at the Faculty of Law at DU's north campus on Friday that the former Prime Minister's sole contribution to the Indian Constitution was the controversial Article 370. 
Incitement is an offence. 
Gathering people and asking them to incite riots is spiteful. 
They (JNU students) encourage people who throw stones at our soldiers in Kashmir. 
They incited people against the state because Afzal Guru was hanged," Swamy said.
