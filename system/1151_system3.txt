Australia allrounder Glenn Maxwell has said he would not risk provoking India captain Virat Kohli in the upcoming four-Test series starting February 23 in Pune.Maxwell, who is a friend of Kohli off the field, said he would not say anything to Kohli that would rile him up. 
I think Steve Smith said it perfectly in the press conference yesterday - the guys that want to get involved verbally, if that gets the best out of them then go for it," Maxwell added.Top-ranked India are on a brilliant run, unbeaten in 19 Tests over a 16-month period with South Africa, New Zealand, England and Bangladesh all vanquished at home, while trips to Sri Lanka and West Indies also culminated in victories.By contrast, Smith's side were thrashed 3-0 in Sri Lanka and lost the first two tests of a three-match home series against South Africa before wholesale changes led to a consolation win in Adelaide and the new charges went on to sweep aside Pakistan.Maxwell feels that the India right-hander is on top of his game at the moment and the best way to get him is by shattering his confidence with a silly run-out or an unfortunate dismissal."
