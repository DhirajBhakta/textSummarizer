While Ahmed Shaikh, a resident of a slum in Kandivli, has not been arrested, he was charged based on a complaint by one Lalsingh Rajpurohit, a builder. 
In his complaint to the police, Rajpurohit said he noticed Shaikhs derogatory comment on a friends Facebook post expressing outrage over the Amarnath yatra terror attack. 
While his friend had put a photo of Thackeray and written a post praising the late leaders stand against terrorism, Shaikh commented with abuses.
