The resolution said the ABPS strongly "condemns the violence by extremists and the Muslim appeasement policy of the state government and calls upon the countrymen to create awareness against the Jehadi violence and the communal politics of the state government." 
The meeting also calls upon the state government to rise above "petty vote-bank politics" and discharge its constitutional obligations, he said.
