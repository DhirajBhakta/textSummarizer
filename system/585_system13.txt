The mayor has set a target of 2024, when the city hopes to host the summer Olympics, to have swimming areas at designated points along the Seine.After decades in which casual bathing in Pariss river and canals was banned for many reasons, including strong currents, fears of bacteria and sewage pollution, authorities are moving to give swimmers more access.In recent years, lone swimmers could regularly be seen taking dips in the canal at La Villette of their own accord, despite the no swimming signs.The official pool structure, opened by city hall at La Villette for the summer as part of the Paris Plages festival, marks the first time in many years that swimmers can legally swim there.
