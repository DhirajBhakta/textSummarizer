During a session at the ongoing Jaipur Literature Festival (JLF), the 64-year-old actor, who has recently released his autobiography "Khullam Khula", said he was two when he accepted his first bribe. 
"I had to give a shot and it was raining that day. 
It was Nargis who came up with the idea to offer me chocolate to get the shot done. 
In that sense, I started taking bribes when I was two-year-old," Rishi said. 
When asked about which of his acting roles he likes the most, he said that it is now that he has started getting acting roles. 
Talking about his family including his wife Neetu and son Ranbir, he said that he is in Jaipur ahead of 37th marriage anniversary which falls on January 22.
