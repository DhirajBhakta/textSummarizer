Box-office clashes have become inevitable in the recent past. 
From Dilwale and Bajirao Mastani to Ae Dil Hai Mushkil and Shivaay to Raees and Kaabil, Bollywood saw some of the biggest films take on each other at the ticket windows recently. 
And now fans are gearing up for another big clash. 
This time Akshay Kumar's Toilet Ek Prem Katha will fight it out with Shah Rukh Khan's next with Imtiaz Ali at the box office. 
Clash is going to happen. 
Last year, Rustom clashed with Hrithik Roshan's Mohenjo Daro, and passed the test with flying colours. 
From a quirky title to an interesting storyline to a fantastic on-screen pairing, the film has already raised expectations.
