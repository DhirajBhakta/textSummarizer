A proposition to travel to the North East is always exciting, and Manipur is a place that provides a gateway to this picturesque part of the country. 
More so, because it is considered to be the largest freshwater lake in the eastern part of India. 
It is known among travellers and photographers due to the round-shaped floating swamps, called Phumdis in the local language.But that's not all that this lake has. 
Very few travellers are aware of Keibul Lamjao, which is the only floating national park in the world. 
This forest is home to the sangai, or the brow-antlered deer, which is one of the most endangered species of deer in the world. 
The sangai is the state animal of Manipur and is an important part of the sociocultural life of the people. 
If media reports are to be believed, the number fell in 2015, but it's not confirmed as the forest officials didn't have enough funds to carry out a head count that year.
