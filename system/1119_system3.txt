Veteran off-spinner Harbhajan Singh has predicted that India will completely dominate the upcoming four-match Test series against Australia, adding that the best the visitors can hope is for a draw in one of the games.Predicting a resounding victory for India, Harbhajan said, "If Australia play well, India will win 3-0. 
If the ball starts spinning from the first ball, I don't think they will survive for long," he said.He said apart from David Warner and Smith, the other Australian batsmen won't be able to play the game as they play in Australian conditions."
