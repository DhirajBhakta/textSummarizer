Third set: Federer 7-6, 7-6, 3-3 Berdych* (*denotes next server)Perhaps Federer cant get that missed break point out of his mind. 15-30 on his serve, and he looks annoyed. 
Back on serve, 4-3 Federer ... and then its Berdychs turn to throw in a bad miss, 5-3 Federer ... 5-4 Federer, wholl now have two points on his serve to take the first set ... 6-4 Federer, two set points ... and one will do!
