According to sources privy to the development, Flipkart has completed the due diligence process and has made an offer of USD 800-850 million to buy Snapdeal. 
However, the offer was rejected by the Snapdeals board which felt the amount undervalues the company as the due diligence report is clean. 
Sources said Ernst & Young, which was roped in by Flipkart to conduct a due diligence on Snapdeal, submitted its report a few days ago, following which the offer was made.
