Stranded at the airport for nearly 24 hours and without their luggage for a good part of the competition, Indian women boxers had to deal with more than just opponents at the Nation's Cup in Serbia but showed tremendous fortitude to return with half a dozen medals.The 10-member team returned to the country early Tuesday morning after finishing third in the competition behind powerhouses Kazakhstan and Russia.Haryana-girl Neeraj (51kg), competing in her maiden international tournament, stood out with a gold medal, while Sarjubala Devi (48kg), Priyanka Chaudhary (60kg), Pooja (69kg) and Seema Punia settled for silver medals.
