The Indian Railways would announce the facility this week. 
Aiming to attract more foreigners and NRI travellers, railways have undertaken steps to facilitate easy booking of tickets for them. 
However, foreigners would be allowed to book tickets only in first AC, second AC and executive class of mail express trains and in Rajdhani, Shatabdi, Gatimaan and Tejas trains 360 days in advance as the facility is not available for sleeper and third AC.
