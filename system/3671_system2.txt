The polls are being closely watched in national politics, with the Bharatiya Janata Party, Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party all in fray. 
There's a lot at stake for three main contenders. 
For Congress, the MCD election could be a chance to save face after embarrassing defeats across the country. 
The party's most recent failure was in the civic polls of Latur, the Maharashtra stronghold that was in the Grand Old Party's control ever since independence. 
Meanwhile, the AAP will be hoping for some redemption after bruising defeats in Punjab and Goa put brakes on Arvind Kejriwal-led party's dreams of going national. 
Swaraj India, the party led by Kejriwal's former Indian Against Corruption partner Yogendra Yadav, is also in the fray for Delhi's civic bodies.
