Evidence of that came at the rally that he addressed this afternoon at Jaswantnagar in his home district of Etwah. 
He? came here asking for votes for his brother Shivpal Yadav but what was more interesting was his open support for a Lok Dal candidate from the Etwah seat.Mulayam rooting for the Lok Dal candidate is significant. 
The party exists mainly on paper and is distinct from the Rashtriya Lok Dal, which is headed by Ajit Singh. 
No mention was made of Akhilesh Yadav or any of that development work done by his government.
