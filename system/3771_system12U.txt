Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has described as a must-watch and something that shakes one deeply a video put out by Aam Aadmi Party colleague Kumar Vishwas, who takes a swipe at the his own government over the issue of corruption.Still recovering from the humiliating defeat in the Rajouri Garden bypoll where the ruling party lost to the BJP and was pushed to a distant third, Kejriwal stepped in quickly to contain the damage the video could do in the run-up to the April 23 municipal elections, billed as a test of AAPs popularity.Reflecting on the state of the nation, Vishwas talks about a host of issues -- from Pakistan, Kashmir to corruption.
