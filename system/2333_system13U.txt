The corpses began arriving last spring, but as the mission to oust Isis fighters from the once-thriving city intensified, so too did the number of dead floating towards the west bank town of Qayyarah.I see dead bodies in the water daily, said Ahmed Mohammed, a driver, speaking earlier this year. 
(Once) the body of a boy also floated by but we could not catch it as it was too small and went through the gaps in the barrier, said the driver Mohammed, who is haunted by guilt at letting the young boy drift away.Human rights organisations had raised alarm about the number of unsolved killings in and around Mosul city and in particular the corpses washing up along the Tigris river.
