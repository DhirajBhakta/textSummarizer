Besides, Delhi metro also uses some of the tertiary colours, a mixture of the primary and secondary colours.DMRC has so far used red, yellow, blue, green, violet, pink, magenta, grey and orange.Some of the colours which the DMRC could use include rose, vermillion, azure and even black, though it is considered inauspicious by many in India.Officials said primary colours were used for phase I lines, secondary colours for phase II lines and for phase III (new lines), tertiary colours are chosen. 
DMRC has issued tenders for the topographical survey of the six lines after they approved by the Delhi government.Officials said construction of the new lines is likely to start by August though DMRC is awaiting approval of the central government.The lines under phase IV, in addition to the 140 kilometres added in phase III, are expected to free up traffic bottlenecks in congested central and southern parts of the city and help passengers from outer Delhi.The phase III of metro expansion is likely to be completed by mid-2017, officials added.
