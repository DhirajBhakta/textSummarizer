t bear the pressure anymore, so Sabbir Khan shifts his focus to Nawazuddin, one of the finest of our times, and makes him do one of the most bizarre roles of his lifetime.Hamming his way to Hotel Bluestar, a property he owns in Delhi, Siddiqui probably knows how it is going to look in the end. 
Talking of close ups, the award for most exciting close up goes to Farah Khan who judges a reality show in Munna Michael. 
She announces her arrival with these lines:Hil jaande sab mere naal, jab main shake karaanFrom UK to Nainital, sab shake karaan.It may sound like a conspiracy theory, but her striking similarity with Kriti Sanon might have prompted Sabbir Khan to cast her.
