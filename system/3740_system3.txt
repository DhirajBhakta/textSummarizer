Passengers travelling between Noida and Kalkaji are likely to be the first one to experience the travel with the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) scheduled to complete the work on this section of phase-III in May.It will then apply for inspection, which usually takes a month, which means the line can be opened for public by June.The new trains will run on two new lines - Pink (Mukundpur-Shiv Vihar) and Magenta (Botanical Garden-Janakpuri west) and will cover a distance of 96 km. 
The mandatory tenure is completed for the Botanical Garden-Kalkaji section and after opening the Heritage Line (ITO-Kashmere Gate), we will start the process for this section, said a DMRC official.The new trains, with extremely high levels of automation, had to undergo rigorous trials between these stations to ensure that they are ready for smooth operations after the commissioning of the corridor.
