According to a senior IIT official, due to 30% increase in number of women students for undergraduate and masters courses, there is severe shortage of accommodation. 
IIT officials said they have placed order for cots and 30-40 of them will be made available from Saturday.We have accommodated all undergraduate students in the hostel. 
Officials said even in 2016, a few students were asked to stay in temporary accommodation but were soon allotted hostels. 
The existing hostels for post-graduate students in IIT-Delhi, Kailash and Himadri, can accommodate 900 students and are fully occupied now.We had not anticipated such an increase but we have provided cots and almirahs to some students. 
They will dine with students in the dining area in the hostel, said the official.The IITs have registered a better representation of women this year  from 8% in 2016 to 9.3 % in 2017.
