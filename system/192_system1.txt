I do think today was the right way to do things.Ferrari have a long history of imposing team orders and designating a No1 driver but the Mercedes executive director, Toto Wolff, agreed with Hamilton and drew a stark comparison with how his team and the Scuderia went racing.We have seen the backlash from decisions that were ruthless and cold blooded and the effect that it had on the brand, he said. 
The great thing is we earned it, this was a tough, tough race and we almost lost it and we got it back.Vettel holds the lead going into the summer break and he has earned it but Hamilton can also rest easy knowing that he held an honourable line in Hungary.
