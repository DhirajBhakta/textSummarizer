Flat buyers who will lose their homes following  the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) order to reduce the height of 70 buildings in the flight path of aircraft said they were being made scapegoats by the authorities. 
They said on Monday that they had bought the apartments legally and blamed officials for not checking the rules while approving construction plans.
