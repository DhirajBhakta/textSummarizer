Suppose if there are too many robbery calls coming from a location which has a bar nearby, we can match those calls with past crimes in the area and understand if that bar is in any way responsible for these robberies, and whether another crime is likely to occur there, he says. 
What softwares such as CMAPS have done is allow larger data collection, and process it in a much more sophisticated mathematical way  a significant improvement over just manual hotspot mapping, which Delhi Police have been doing so far.But statistical model-based predictive policing has raised concerns in the West that it might create prejudices against particular communities or areas and how much power should be accorded to computer algorithms.Any statistical model can be flawed, but we hope it will be too dynamic to hold any area guilty of a crime for long, says Beniwal.
