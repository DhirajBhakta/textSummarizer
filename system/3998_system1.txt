In an advisory sent to the media organisation, the poll watchdog pointed to Section 126 A of the Representation of the People Act which states that "no person shall conduct any exit poll and publish or publicise by means of the print and electronic media or disseminate in any other manner, whatsoever, the result of any exit poll during such period as may be notified by the Election Commission..." 
During the elections to the assemblies of Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Goa and Manipur, the period during which exit polls were banned was 7.00 am on February 4, when the first phase of elections commenced till 5.30 pm March 9 when the last of the polls were held. "...it has been observed that some of the TV channels telecast certain programmes projecting the number of seats likely to be won by political parties.
