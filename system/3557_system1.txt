Those trying to stall the release of the Salman KhaN- starrer are citing a law passed by the Federal Ministry of Information in 2010 which forbids the release of any Indian film on a Muslim holiday. 
Sohail Khan, the producer of "Shor Sharaba", said, "My film is supposed to release on Eid-ul-Fitr and if the government doesnt stall Tubelight, I will not release it as a mark of protest."
