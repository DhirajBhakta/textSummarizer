If Salman Khan and Katrina Kaif couldn't take their eyes off each other at IIFA 2017, the Bajrangi Bhaijaan actor made the event all the more memorable for his 'close friend' Katrina when he sang Happy Birthday for her. 
The Jab Tak Hai Jaan actor will turn 34 on July 16, but the 51-year-old actor couldn't wait that long to wish her, and grabbed the first opportunity to wish his friend.
