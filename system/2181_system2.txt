For more than 17 years, a family of five from Goregaon (East) has been planting saplings across Aarey Milk Colony during the monsoon and caring for them till they become full-grown trees. 
They have so far planted 5,500 saplings. 
These are mostly plants that will attract the butterflies and help with their life cycle, he said, adding that his son Malhar has planted saplings all by himself and loves to be in the company of butterflies.Their efforts come at a time when Aarey is being besieged by several development projects. 
Initially, we bought our own saplings and planted them, but after a while we began receiving donations and saplings from different groups that joined us on weekends, said Sandeep adding, We never wanted publicity.
