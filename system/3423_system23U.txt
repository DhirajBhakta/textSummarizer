The Board unanimously authorised the acting honorary secretary of the BCCI to continue negotiations with the ICC in the best interest of the BCCI while keeping its legal options open," the BCCI said after a special general meeting."
The BCCI... unanimously decided that the Indian cricket team will participate in the upcoming ICC Champions Trophy."
At last month's ICC meetings, the BCCI was outvoted 13-1 in its bid to halt the revised deal which considerably slashes India's share from global events in the 2015-23 cycle.Unimpressed by the $293 million forecast, down from the $570 million it would have received under a 2014 arrangement, the BCCI responded by refusing to name a squad for the June 1-18 eight-team competition.Acting BCCI secretary Amitabh Choudhary will now continue to negotiate with the world governing body to get a bigger share of ICC revenues during the next eight-year cycle."
