China's real population may have been about 1.29 billion last year, 90 million fewer people than the official figure released by the National Bureau of Statistics," the South China Morning Post quoted Yi Fuxian, a scholar and demographer at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, as saying at a seminar in Peking University on Monday.Yi, who has been a critic of the Chinese government's family planning measures and warned of an upcoming ageing crisis for China, said that the government had overstated China's population since 1990. 
"The government has overestimated the birth rate and underestimated the speed of demographic changes," Li Jianxin, another demographer who is at Peking University, was quoted as saying by SCMP. 
The population data since the adaption of one-child policy has been seriously false and the family planning report has been overstated by 30 per cent," Liang was quoted as saying.
