Thanjavur, Jan 16 (PTI) M Natarajan, husband of AIADMK general secretary V K Sasikala, tonight accused "some sections" in the BJP of trying to split the AIADMK and get the state government dismissed. 
Later when asked by reporters about the attempts to divide the party and dismiss the government, Natarajan said definitely attempts were on at the behest of S Gurumurthy, the RSS ideologue. 
"There were just four or five of us who protected her...for 36 years since then, my wife Sasikala was bearing her on her shoulders," Natarajan said delving on the hard sacrifices that he and his family had made to protect Jayalalithaa and thereby preserve the AIADMK from the designs of the rival DMK.
