Yasuko Shimizu, the chief of mission for UNHCR in India and the Maldives, who was awarded the Indira Gandhi Prize for Peace, Disarmament and Development 2015, said that the country has helped refugees by providing work permits and issuing long term visas. 
Although we give refugee cards to displaced people but the government here issues long term visas for them which is very helpful," Shimizu said.
