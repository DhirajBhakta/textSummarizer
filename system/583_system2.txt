Antonio Cassano has announced his decision to retire from football just a week after reversing his decision.The 35-year-old joined Verona on 10?July but announced less than seven days later that he would be retiring, before he was persuaded to perform a dramatic U-turn within hours of making his decision public. 
I apologise to the city of Verona, to all the fans, to the president.For a 35-year-old man I need to be motivated and at this moment I feel that my priority is represented by being close to my children and my wife.Earlier on Monday the Verona president, Maurizio Setti, had confirmed Cassanos departure with immediate effect.
