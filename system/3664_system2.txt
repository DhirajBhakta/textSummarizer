What Mother Teresa is to Calcutta's dying destitutes, Dr Murugappa Chennaveerappa Modi, 72. is to the poor blind villagers of Karnataka. 
Modi, the internationally recognised eye surgeon, has been waging a one-man war against blindness. 
This tragic fact of rural India spurred Modi to pioneer the concept of mass eye camps.In an assembly line fashion, Modi operates 40 patients an hour, attending to four patients at a time. 
Earlier, Modi used to perform 600 to 700 operations a day in his camps. 
Hellen Keller, the blind and deaf-mute American author, who attended one of his camps in 1954 asked Modi: "Have you insured your hands?" 
In his mass eye camps, apart from the 5.79 lakh operations, he has examined 50 lakh patients and given free food to over 100 lakh persons.Initially Modi had a hard time communicating his mission to the people.
