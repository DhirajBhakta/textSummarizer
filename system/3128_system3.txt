Australias consumer watchdog carried out a sting operation against Apple which it says caught staff repeatedly misleading iPhone customers about their legal rights to a free repair or replacement after a so-called error 53 malfunction, court documents reveal.Australian authorities lodged a high-profile case against Apple this year, after iPhone and iPad customers experienced a malfunction that rendered phones useless if it detects that a repair has been carried out by a non-Apple technician. 
The fault occurred between late 2014 until early last year.The case, set to go to trial in mid-December, accuses Apple of wrongly telling customers they were not entitled to free replacements or repair if they had taken their devices to an unauthorised third-party repairer.That advice was allegedly given even where the repair  a screen replacement, for example  was not related to the fault.Apple has so far chosen to remain silent about the case brought by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC). 
But court documents obtained by Guardian Australia show the company has denied the ACCCs allegations, saying it did not mislead or cause any harm to its Australian customers.The documents also show how the ACCC used undercover methods to investigate Apple. 
Investigators, posing as iPhone customers, called all 13 Apple retailers across Australia in June last year.They told Apple staff their iPhone speakers had stopped working after screens were replaced by a third party.Apples response was the same in each of the 13 calls, the ACCC alleges.In each call, Apple Australia represented to the ACCC caller that no Apple entity ... was required to, or would, remedy the defective speaker at no cost under the [Australian consumer law] if the screen of the iPhone had been replaced by someone other than Apple Australia or an Apple-authorised service provider, the ACCCs court claim alleged. 
The ACCC has also alleged information on Apple USs website misled customers about their rights. 
Apple said it had also established an error 53 outreach program and offered replacements or repairs for many of the phones referred to in the ACCCs case.
