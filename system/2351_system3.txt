The move comes amid widespread outrage and anger over mob violence in the name of the cow, considered holy by many Hindus.RSS insiders said senior swayamsevaks, along with one or two swayamsevaks and a Rashtra Sevika Sangh (RSS womens wing) worker, visit families and educate them on the benefits of vegetarianism and how to avoid being influenced by foreign culture, especially as shown by various television channels and social media portals.One such group led by RSS leader Ashok Bhatt, the Vidarbha convener of Kutumb Prabodhan, visited the family of Suresh Deshpande in Nagpurs Sadar locality last week.  
The Deshpandes were told to take up social work.The RSS team enquired about our food habits, favourite TV channels and shows, how we celebrate birthday and our preference of attire, said Suresh.He said the talk was a good concept aimed at strengthening the bond between family members. 
Bhatt said they have been getting a good response.We are also asking the families to sit together at least once a week to help to create bonhomie and strengthen ties among the members, he said.Atul Pingle, a senior RSS leader and Vidarbha Prant Pracharak Pramukh, said such an initiative was the need of the hour when people were becoming more materialistic and self-centred.We will also visit the families of minorities like Muslims and Christians, said Pingle, adding the campaign would help restore harmony, friendship and community bond among people.The Kutumb Prabodhan campaign is a major initiative of the RSS, the ideological mentor of the ruling BJP, after its pet project of one temple, one crematorium and one well for all in each village that was launched last year across the country on Dr Babasaheb Ambedkars 125th birth anniversary in an effort to propagate social equality and harmony.
