Ahead of the budget, Prime Minister Narendra Modi today favoured increasing the tax contribution from various market participants in a "fair, efficient and transparent way" and promised more "sound and prudent policies and reform measures". 
Asking the regulators and taxmen to think about the contribution of market participants to the exchequer, Modi said, "The low contribution of taxes may be due to the structure of our tax laws. 
Securities transaction tax also features among the various levies in the financial markets. 
"Those who profit from the financial markets must make a fair contribution to nation-building through taxes.
