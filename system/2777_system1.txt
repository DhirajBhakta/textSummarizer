Building on this work, researchers from Max-Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems in Germany and Institute for Bioengineering of Catalonia (IBEC) in Spain wanted to see if they could engineer tiny robots to remove waterborne bacteria. 
One face is made with magnesium, which reacts with water to produce hydrogen bubbles to propel the microbots. 
The other face is made out of alternating iron and gold layers topped by silver nanoparticles.
