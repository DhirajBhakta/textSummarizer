Los Angeles, Jan 8 (PTI) In a bizarre incident, an American woman living near an airport thought a massive bird had splattered her car with droppings only to realise that it was a plane that had dumped human waste on her property. 
"Its disgusting...At first I thought, Wow, some bird really took a dump on my car!" 
She lives in West Jordan south of Salt Lake International airport, and it is not uncommon for her to see dozens of airplanes fly over her house daily.
