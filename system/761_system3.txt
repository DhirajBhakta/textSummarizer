The material was handed over to the FBI, which transmitted the list to Interpol for global sharing.A note appended to the Interpol list circulated in Italy explains how the terrorist database was constructed, putting together the pieces of the puzzle from hundreds of elements, mainly gathered when Isis local headquarters were captured.The people, the note says, have been identified through materials found in the hiding places of Isil, the Islamic state of Iraq and the Levant. 
The note adds that it emerges that those subjects may have manifested willingness to commit a suicidal attack or martyrdom to support Islam.The list shows the suspects names, the date Isis recruited them, their last likely address including the mosque at which they have been praying while away fighting, their mothers name and any photographs.For each of the fighters, an ID was created to ensure that each member country in the Interpol network could integrate the data with local databases.Interpol has asked its national partners for any information they might have about each name on the list, and any other background personal data they have on their files, such as border crossings, previous criminal offences, biometric data, passport numbers, activity on social media and travel history.The information will then be included in Interpols ASF (automatic search facility) database in order to possibly put the names on a higher level watch list.US intelligence is apparently confident about the reliability of the sources used to compile the list. 
US Army Col Ryan Dillon on Friday estimated there were around 2,000 Isis militants in the city, who he said were using civilians and children as human shields.
