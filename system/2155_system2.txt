Swashbuckling India opener Virender Sehwag was singing songs of Kishore Kumar during the course of his record 149-ball 219-run knock against the West Indies in the fourth ODI in Indore, his team-mate Suresh Raina said."
He was playing very well with no tension. 
That day, he was singing some Kishore Kumar songs. 
He was not feeling any kind of tension," Raina, who cracked 55 in a 140 run-stand for the third wicket with Sehwag, said while addressing the 'India Today Mind Rocks Youth Summit' here.Asked whether he too joined him in singing, Raina said "No, I was only on 30 at that time. 
So, I did not."

We are doing well. 
Most importantly, every member of the team is contributing," Srikkanth said.
