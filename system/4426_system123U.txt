Washington, Feb 27 (PTI) NASA plans to send its first robotic spacecraft to the Sun next year that is slated to get within six million kilometres of the blazing star to probe its atmosphere. 
"This is going to be our first mission to fly to the Sun," said Eric Christian, a NASA research scientist at Goddard Space Flight Centre. 
"We cant get to the very surface of the Sun," but the mission will get close enough to answer three important questions, Christian said.
