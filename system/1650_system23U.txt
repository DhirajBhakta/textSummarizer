Model-turned actor Arjun Rampal and Bollywood star Jackie Shroff could be the star campaigners for the Bhartiya Janata Party ahead of the Uttar Pradesh assembly election. 
Speculation regarding this started emerging after the duo reached the BJP's headquarters in New Delhi early this morning and held meetings with party officials. 
Rampal also said that he was impressed with the BJP since he believed that the party was working for the development of the people.
