The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG), which earlier waived off property tax for several malls on the condition of providing free basement parking to city residents, has decided to put up free parking signboards at entry points of malls on MG Road.The move has come after MCG received complaints that malls continued to charge visitors for parking despite their commitment to provide the service for free.V Umashankar, MCG commissioner, said, In case people find mall managements violating the free parking commitments, they can lodge complaints instantly. 
We have issued instructions to mall managements in this regard.Visible display of free parking signboards will help people. 
Such establishments onSohna Road are JMD Megapolis, JMD Galleria and Ninex City Mart.The idea of free parking would help reduce parking hazards on the roads too. 
We wish every commercial establishment, including malls, used its basements for free parking.
