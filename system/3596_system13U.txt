In an embarrassing gaffe for the Punjab Vidhan Sabha Speaker, a press release condoling Vinod Khanna's death on Thursday, named Rajesh Khanna in its opening line instead.The mistake was pointed out on Twitter by journalist Man Aman Chhina, who shared a screenshot of the press release saying, "Punjab PR department copy pastes press release of Rajesh Khanna for Vinod Khanna. 
Chhina's assumption that it was a copy-paste job could be legit, considering Rajesh Khanna was a Member of Parliament as well.Veteran actor Vinod Khanna, who was suffering from cancer, passed away on Thursday morning at Mumbai's HN Reliance Hospital.The 70-year-old was hospitalised due to "severe dehydration" on March 31.
