Separated in childhood, twins, Karan and Charan (both played by Arjun Kapoor) are expected to marry as per their guardians wishes, but they are already in love with Sweety (Ileana DCruz) and Nafisa (Neha Sharma).Things get complicated when Charan gets engaged to a another girl, Binkal (Athiya Shetty) in London.
