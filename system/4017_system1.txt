In an interview with Hindustan Times, Alia said, "I do want to settle down early (in life) because I have an advantage of having started off (in career) very early. 
That way, I can get done with it (getting married) and continue (in my career). 
I think I will only get married when I want to have babies." 
We wonder how Sidharth will react to Alia's admission that she wants to get married soon.
