The nation's favourite 'dulhania' Alia Bhatt is just 24, but marriage might not be very far off into the future for her. 
In an interview with Hindustan Times, Alia said, "I do want to settle down early (in life) because I have an advantage of having started off (in career) very early. 
That way, I can get done with it (getting married) and continue (in my career). 
Also, I don't want to settle down too late in life because that also has its own issues." 
We wonder how Sidharth will react to Alia's admission that she wants to get married soon.
