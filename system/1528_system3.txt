Following tradition, outgoing US President Barack Obama and his family will board the Air Force One for the final time as they fly to Palm Springs in California for a vacation after US President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration on January 20. 
"The first family is looking forward to flying to Palm Springs, California on Friday. 
The President vowed to take his family to a destination that is warmer than Washington DC on Friday and Palm Springs fits the bill," White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters on Tuesday. 
Its a tradition for the outgoing president to fly out of Washington DC for the final time after being succeeded by a new president. 
Before he boards the Air Force One, Obama would give final remarks to the press at the tarmac of Andrews Air Force Base.
