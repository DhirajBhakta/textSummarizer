Party presidium chairman E Madhusudanan, who was earlier in the day expelled by VK Sasikala, hit back at the general secretary in the evening. 
Madhusudanan, claimed that he had sacked Sasikala before she expelled him from the AIADMK. 
Sasikala had removed Panneerselvam from the treasurer post immediately after his revolt, but he has maintained that being a temporary general secretary, she does not have the powers to appoint or remove party functionaries. 
Insisting that he continues to be the treasurer, Panneerselvam has written to banks not to allow anybody else to operate the party accounts without his consent.Sasikala had appointed another senior leader Dindigul C Srinivasan as the treasurer.
