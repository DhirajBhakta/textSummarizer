By Ashwini Shrivastava New Delhi, Apr 23 (PTI) The Ministry of External Affairs has made a provision enabling people to apply online for passports in Hindi. 
The move comes after President Pranab Mukherjee recently accepted recommendations made in this regard by the Committee of Parliament on Official Language via its ninth report. 
The panel had suggested that bilingual forms should be made available by all passport offices and forms filled in Hindi should also be accepted.
