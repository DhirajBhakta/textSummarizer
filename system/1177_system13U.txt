The Valentine's Day which is better known as the day of international love, attracts a lot of hate organisations who find different ways and means to harass the young couples celebrating their love on different locations. 
On the eve of Valentine's day Bajrang Dal has warned the youth to stay away from celebrating Valentine's Day in any form. 
Just like every year, this year also moral policing will take place on 14th of Feb, where youth will be facing harassments on celebrating the occasion.
