Eighteen years ago, Sasi Gangadharan, a coconut tree climber from the outskirts of Kerala's Thiruvananthapuram district, fell down from a coconut tree. 
Sasi reached out to the panchayat to help him with a three-wheeler to set up a small business, but they turned down his repeated requests stating that there is no motorable road till his house. 
Seeing his plea falling on deaf years, the semi-paralysed man decided to make things work, all by himself.
