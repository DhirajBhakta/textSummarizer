When I started in the industry, people had helped me; so why not extend that favour to others.I know how it feels  when people call you an outsider. 
says Richa, who has been part of the industry for nine years now with films such as Gangs of Wasseypur (2012), Masaan (2015)  and Sarbjit (2016) to her credit. 
In fact, after that, for two years, I did TV commercials and not films. 
Then Gangs of  Wasseypur happened and I have been lucky to do  good roles. 
I always wanted to be in films that would be memorable. 
Sometimes, we watch films and then forget them instantaneously; I never wanted to be part of them,?
