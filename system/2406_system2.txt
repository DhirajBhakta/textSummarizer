However, now that she has received recognition and a position in the industry, she wants to extend a helping hand to newcomers.I dont think I have that aukat (stature, status)  to be anyones godmother right now, but I will do whatever I can to help newcomers. 
When I started in the industry, people had helped me; so why not extend that favour to others.I know how it feels  when people call you an outsider. 
When I did Oye Lucky, I had just finished my education and didnt have the guidance and the maturity to decide what kind of genre I should do.
