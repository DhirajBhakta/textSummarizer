Precious hours are lost when police commute long distances to take the victims to a government hospital, Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain said.The government has selected about 230 private hospitals in the city, which have more than 20 beds, intensive care units, and equipped to deal with emergency cases such as road accidents and burns.Most often private hospitals either dont admit road accident victims or simply stabilise the patients before sending them off to a government hospital.
