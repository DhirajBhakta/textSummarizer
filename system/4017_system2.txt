The nation's favourite 'dulhania' Alia Bhatt is just 24, but marriage might not be very far off into the future for her. 
In an interview with Hindustan Times, Alia said, "I do want to settle down early (in life) because I have an advantage of having started off (in career) very early. 
When Varun Dhawan was asked on Koffee With Karan what Sidharth had that he did not, he looked suggestively at Alia. 
In fact, Sidharth was even clicked entering Alia's house on Valentine's Day. 
I think I will only get married when I want to have babies." 
We wonder how Sidharth will react to Alia's admission that she wants to get married soon.
