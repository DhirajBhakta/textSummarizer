In an interview with Hindustan Times, Alia said, "I do want to settle down early (in life) because I have an advantage of having started off (in career) very early. 
That way, I can get done with it (getting married) and continue (in my career). 
However, the Dear Zindagi actor added that she is not "thinking about it or planning as of now."
Although the two have been in denial mode, several hints have been dropped. 
When Varun Dhawan was asked on Koffee With Karan what Sidharth had that he did not, he looked suggestively at Alia. 
Last week, the rumoured couple walked hand-in-hand out of a recent award show. 
In fact, Sidharth was even clicked entering Alia's house on Valentine's Day. 
When it comes to marriage, Sidharth seems to have somewhat different views. 
He had told DNA, "In today's day and age, marriage has become just a tagline. 
We wonder how Sidharth will react to Alia's admission that she wants to get married soon.
