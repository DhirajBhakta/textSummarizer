In his order, Justice Ashok B Hinchigeri observed that "laudable objectives" to tackle the menaces of fake currency notes, black money and terrorism cannot be achieved without imposing restrictions. "...but in a situation of this nature, no directions, much less time-bound directions, can be given to the government of India and the RBI," he said. 
"In the larger interests of the society, when a comprehensive mission is being accomplished, certain regulatory measures during the period of transition are bound to affect the interests of some sections of people," the order said.
