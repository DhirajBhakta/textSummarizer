Washington, Apr 17 (PTI) Inspired by the Chinese and Japanese arts of paper-cutting, scientists have developed a light-weight, paper-based device that can harvest energy from body movements to power sensors and watches. 
Researchers from Georgia Institute of Technology in the US and Chongqing University in China wanted to see if they could untether small energy needs from the wall socket by harvesting energy from a users body movements.
