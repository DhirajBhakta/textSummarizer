New Delhi, Jun 25 (PTI) Undue sympathy towards convicts by awarding inadequate jail term "undermines public confidence in efficacy of law", the Delhi High Court has said while upholding a 10-year term awarded by a trial court to a man for raping and trying to kill his ex-employers daughter-in-law. 
"It is the duty of every court to award proper sentence having regard to the nature of the offence and the manner in which it was committed. 
The trial court had awarded 10 years to the convict for the offence of rape and seven years for attempting to murder the victim, who had assisted him in getting a job and also used to teach his kids. 
Rejecting his plea, the court said that the man had betrayed the trust of the victim and "exhibited animal instinct at the time of commission of the crime".
