Given that Googles indexing system will capture anything thats publicly accessible on the internet, leaks such as those created by an Indian pathology lab which uploaded more than 43,000 patient records in December, including names and HIV blood test results, can be particularly damaging.The last change to the removal policy was made in 2015 with the addition of nude or sexually explicit images that were uploaded or shared without your consent to cover so-called revenge porn.The new addition to Googles scrubbing policy marks a change from the search companys traditional hands-off, algorithmic approach which resists attempts at censorship. 
Google recently adjusted its search results to down-rank contested information such as fake news.For many Google has become the gateway to the internet, meaning that removal from the companys search results effectively scrubs them from the internet. 
While the information will still be accessible via other search engines or directly, other associated actions including the European right to be forgotten have seen being removed from Googles search results as good enough to affect change.Google has recently come under fire for its search and services such as YouTube being used to spread extremist content, as well as its ad network being used to fund sites dedicated to spreading hate speech and propaganda.
