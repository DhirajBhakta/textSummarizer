New Delhi, Apr 25 (PTI) The Income Tax department has issued a Rs 24,646 crore tax demand notice to Sahara Groups Aamby Valley Limited (AVL) after conducting a special audit of the company. 
The department, as part of a special investigation and audit into the account books of AVL, found that an income of over Rs 48,000 crore for a particular assessment year was allegedly not reflected in the record books of the firm and hence it raised a fresh tax demand and penalty amount on it.
