The move comes after President Pranab Mukherjee recently accepted recommendations made in this regard by the Committee of Parliament on Official Language via its ninth report. 
The panel had suggested that bilingual forms should be made available by all passport offices and forms filled in Hindi should also be accepted. 
The panel on the official language had also recommended that information regarding passport and visa should be made available in Hindi on the official website of the ministry.
