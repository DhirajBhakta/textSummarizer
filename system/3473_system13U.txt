Delhi Congress chief Ajay Maken on Wednesday indicated that his resignation was not accepted as the party high command chose him over former chief minister Sheila Dikshit.

WASN'T CALLED FOR CAMPAIGNING: SHEILA DIKSHITDikshit, who ruled Delhi for 15 years, alleged that she wasn't called for campaigning during polls.
