Mumbai, Apr 2 (PTI) Banker Uday Kotak feels there will be strong consolidation in the financial services sector and eventually only five players will dominate the space just like in the global space. 
When asked about the names of banks which will dominate the domestic banking space, Kotak declined to specify the names but said State Bank of India will be one among them. 
Kotak also made a strong pitch for having norms on "bank mortality", underlining that not all the players who enter due to liberal rules cant make it commercially, and should thus be given exit options. 
When pointed to the continuing reluctance of private sector to invest since the past three years now, Kotak said, "we need to be bold and get the animal spirits back.
