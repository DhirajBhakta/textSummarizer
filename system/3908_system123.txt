In its first public response to the airstrikes, the Kremlin has issued a strong statement condemning the US move as aggression against a sovereign nation.Moscow said the strikes had been carried out on an invented pretext and claimed the Syrian army did not have chemical weapons.The strikes, it said, would do significant damage to US-Russia ties and created a serious obstacle to creating an international coalition to defeat Isis.Russian president Vladimir Putin, the Kremlin said, views the strikes as an attempt to deflect world attention from civilian deaths in Iraq  where at least 150 people died in a series of coalition airstrikes in Mosul last month.
