If the Delhi BJP leaders thought they enjoyed the pleasure of the central leadership after the emphatic victory in MCD elections, an utterly rude shock awaited them.Upset with the lax attitude of Delhi BJP leaders and bickering within the state party unit, the party's national president Amit Shah on Friday took them to task and noted that the party leaders spent more time meeting the top leaders than reaching out to the common people.In a meeting with Delhi BJP office bearers on day one of his Delhi pravaas, Shah also set a target of securing 51 per cent votes in the next assembly polls.
