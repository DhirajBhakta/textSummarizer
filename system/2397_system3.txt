In an effort to make an inclusive society, Delhi Police has been training more than 2400 young adults, in the 14 to 25 age group, in different vocational skills. 
As part of project YUVA, these youngsters have been shortlisted from 3500 children and youngsters, from the economically weaker sections of the society.   ?
This initiative of Delhi Police is in collaboration with the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) and National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC). ?
And based on our previous experiences, we realised that police can maintain the law and order situation and control crime, when they interact with the stake holders [offenders] in a non-policing way.
