I am happy to be elected as a member. 
Congratulations to @Pvsindhu1 for being chosen as a new member of BWF Athletes' Commission. pic.twitter.com/btJ2cgYHTOSindhu, Gilmour along with Germany's Marc Zwiebler, who received 108 votes, will serve four-year terms. 
The Chinese player became a member of the Athletes' Commission in 2015 but resigned following her retirement from badminton last year, thus leaving a casual vacancy on the Commission.
