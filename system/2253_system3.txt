Delhi cops acting as midwives As crazy as that sounds, the cops  yes, even male cops  are trained to help deliver babies in emergency situations, and that training comes in handy every now and then. 
To cut a long story short, a PCR van (mobile patrol) arrived, and the woman delivered her baby in the van.We rushed to the spot on receiving the call. 
While taking her to the hospital, her water broke and we had to get the baby delivered in the van itself, near Netaji Subhash Marg, says Inspector Rajendra Sehrawat, who was present during the incident. 
In most such cases, PCR vans come with policewomen, but this time, there were only two male police officers who handled the case. 
But this time, the womans husband and our inspectors had to take charge. 
This father agreed and didnt touch the baby girl, says Sehrawat.
