are trained to help deliver babies in emergency situations, and that training comes in handy every now and then. 
One recent occasion was when a woman went into labour at Old Delhi Railway Station at 4.15am; her panicked husband called the police control room. 
While taking her to the hospital, her water broke and we had to get the baby delivered in the van itself, near Netaji Subhash Marg,? 
ve briefed our staff not to disturb the cord, giving the mother her privacy and taking the mother and baby to the nearest hospital. 
re asked to not move the baby from his/her position, but convincing parents at that time is difficult. 
The baby and mother were then taken to the LNJP hospital, Daryaganj, and were declared in good health.
