You can count on a successor this year, even if you don't hear a date from me now".The current Pixel duo lack some key features which we would like to see in their successor such as dust/water resistance, optical image stabilisation, wireless charging and stereo speakers.Google could also do with reducing the size of the bezels and tweaking the current 'love it or hate it' design.The Pixel and XL come with everything expected of a flagship smartphone in today's times - 4GB of RAM, a 5.0'/5.5' AMOLED display with Gorilla Glass 4 on top, 32/128GB of internal storage and the Snapdragon 821 processor.The Google Pixel comes with Google Assistant, Google's answer to the Siris and Cortanas of the world.
