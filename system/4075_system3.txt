A fringe Muslim group in West Bengal has demanded the removal of a statue of "Bangabandhu" Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the founder of Bangladesh from a government hostel in Kolkata.Terming the statue "unethical and anti-Islamic", the All Bengal Minority Youth Federation (ABMYF) has opposed the statue at the government run Baker hostel. 
The group says, the hostel is meant for Muslim students and since it has a mosque in its premises, such a statue could not be allowed in an "Islamic atmosphere".The 110 year-old? hostel, located in central Kolkata was home to the great leader between 1945 and 1946 when he was a student at the erstwhile Islamia college in Kolkata. 
In 1998, the then left front government in the state had converted his room on the third floor of the hostel into a memorial and alter a white marble statue of Bangabandhu was also installed."
We cannot read Namaz and also install statues at the same place. 
No Muslim institutions have statues inside them. 
Aligarh Muslim University was built by Sir Syed Ahmed Khan but his statue was never installed at the university," he argued.MAMATA BANERJEE EMBARRASSED
