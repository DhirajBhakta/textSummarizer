Theresa May will not remain in power long as Brexit cripples her government, while Donald Trump is a would-be dictator who is going to fail, the billionaire investor George Soros has told the Davos world economic forum.On the eve of Trumps inauguration as president, Soros delivered a scathing assessment, saying the impostor and con-man was gearing up for a trade war which would have a very far-reaching effect in Europe and other parts of the world.The would-be-dictator  didnt expect to win, he was surprised, Soros told an audience of business leaders and journalists in Davos where the World Economic Forum is being held.I personally have confidence that hes going to fail  because his ideas that guide him are inherently self-contradictory, added Soros, who was a supporter of Trumps Democratic rival Hillary Clinton during the 2016 US presidential election campaign.Soros said he expected financial markets to not do very well because of the uncertainty generated by the Trump administration.On Theresa May and Brexit, Soros predicted economic upheaval in Britain and substantial difficulties in bringing about a clean break with the European Union  and the prospect of the UK quickly joining again or entering a successor arrangement once the referendum mandate of leaving the EU was fulfilled.In my opinion it is unlikely that prime minister May is actually going to remain in power. 
Its much harder to divorce than to get married, so I think the desire for rapprochement will develop, and in theory or maybe even in practice you could have a situation in 2019 or 2020 when Britain will leave the EU, because it does have to take place, but they could leave on a Friday but join over the weekend and have the new arrangement in place in Monday morning.Soros said he hoped both sides would realise they must find some common ground and find common ground to avoid a bitter divorce.The future for Europe looked bleak, Soros said, after a disastrous 2016.
