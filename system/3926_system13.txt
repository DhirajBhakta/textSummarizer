Washington, Apr 3 (PTI) Tree trunks in upland forests actually emit methane rather than storing it, say scientists who claim to have found a new, previously unaccounted source of this powerful greenhouse gas. 
They tested a cluster of trees, soil and coarse woody debris (CWD) - dead wood lying on the forest floor in various stages of decomposition - to measure fluxes of methane and carbon dioxide.
