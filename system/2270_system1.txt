Ten trucks and an excavator machine that were allegedly dumping debris at a 400-acre wetland area opposite Millat Nagar, Lokhandwala Backroad in Andheri, were seized by the Oshiwara police on Saturday. 
Twelve people have been detained for the alleged environment violation and were fined Rs60,000, police officials said. 
At 9am on Saturday, residents told members of the Oshiwara Lokhandwala Citizens Association (OLCA) that they saw 10 trucks dumping debris at the wetland through the night. 
They said the dumping activity went on even during the day. 
The periphery of the wetland site has dense mangrove cover but the centre is a bald patch that gets good supply of brackish water,?
