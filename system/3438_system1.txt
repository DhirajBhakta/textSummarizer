In what could have been a repeat of last month's Arjun Bhardwaj suicide, a 32-year-old woman lawyer attempted killing herself in Mumbai while live-streaming her life's final moments on social media. 
Priyanka Jethalal Maru planned to jump off the 18th floor of an under-construction building. 
However, officials from the Mumbai Police who reached the location dissuaded her from taking her life. 
ARJUN BHARDWAJ INCIDENTLast month, 23-year-old college student Arjun Bhardwaj ended his life by jumping off the 19th floor window of a five-star hotel in suburban Bandra. 
Before smashing the hotel room's windows and jumping off, Bhardwaj live streamed his final moments on Facebook in a video that went viral on social media.
