Harshvardhan Kapoor, who made his big Bollywood debut with Mirzya, went onto win a handful of Best Debut trophies at various award functions. 
And the 26-year-old actor was expecting the same at Filmfare Awards which took place recently. 
But to his surprise, the Best Debut trophy went to Diljit Dosanjh for Udta Punjab. 
And this hasn't gone down too well with Junior Kapoor. 
He expressed his displeasure over not winning the award and said, "Although I picked up two debutant awards earlier, I was really looking forward to winning the black lady. 
But I guess every awards event has its own parameters. 
I'll be honest, though. 
I think a debutant award is meant for someone working on his first film. 
It shouldn't go to an actor who has worked in several films in another industry or language."
