On his second visit to Gorakhpur after assuming charge as Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister, Yogi Adityanath warned law-breakers of strict action if they took law into their hands. 
In an oblique warning to members of "gau-rakshaks" brigade and "anti-Romeo squad", the chief minister said that he will not compromise with law and order at any cost."
I am committed to fulfill the dreams of our people to make Uttar Pradesh the best ruled state in the country.
