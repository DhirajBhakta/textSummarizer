Rishi Kapoor lashed out at director Anurag Basu after the lukewarm response to son Ranbir Kapoors new film, Jagga Jasoos. 
Calling him irresponsible, the actor said that Basu fails to complete films on time. 
In an interview with Mid-Day, Rishi Kapoor also slammed music composer Pritam.  
You may be thinking you are making the Taj Mahal, but you are supposed to make it ready on time. 
But, a kids film also has to release at the right time, like during the school vacations.
