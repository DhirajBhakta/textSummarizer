BJP MLA Brijesh Singh's posters thanking voters for the recent astounding victory have created a stir in the Saharanpur district of Uttar Pradesh after they named Deoband as Deovrind. 
While Deoband is known for its historical significance and Darul Uloom Deoband has been a centre of Islamic learning since the Mughal era, Brijesh Singh had demanded that the city be renamed Deovrind after BJP came into power.
