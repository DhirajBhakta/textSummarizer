The Supreme Court today upheld the death sentence meted out to the four adult men in the December 2012 Nirbhaya gangrape and murder case. 
A three-judge bench of Justices Dipak Misra, R. 
Banumathi and Ashok Bhushan dismissed the rapists' challenge of the Delhi High Court verdict. 
The Supreme Court judgement, as well as separate concurring judgements by Justices Misra and Banumathi, explained the reasoning behind the apex court upholding the death penalty, and said that if the brutal 2012 gangrape and murder did not fall under the rarest of rare category then "one may wonder what else would fall in that category." 
Those convicts on the death row, Mukesh (29), Pawan (22), Vinay Sharma (23) and Akshay Singh (31), plan to file a review petition challenging today's Supreme Court verdict.
