To end all doubt, Kamya took to Twitter to reveal that her account was hacked and the hacker  deleted the photo, as till date she has never removed any posts from her account. 
Never took off something I once posted. 
When contacted, the actor said that she has already given out all the details on Twitter and doesnt want to talk more about this.I did not take off a bare piece of clothing off my back.
