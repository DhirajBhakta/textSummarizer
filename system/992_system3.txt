I think after doing 126 movies, one cant say I have not been doing that many films. 
I think I should take it easy and focus on them and share with them whatever I have learnt, Shetty said.He has been away from the big screen for three years and will be next seen playing the antagonist in A Gentleman, starring Sidharth Malhotra. 
I am indebted to Salman Khan (the producer) and Nikhil Advani (director).Athiyas next film Mubarakan is releasing two years after her debut but Shetty has said he is not worried about the long gap between and appreciates Athiyas patience and choice of movies. 
I am proud of the way she is going about her career.
