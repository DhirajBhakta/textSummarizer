For the August 5 vice presidential elections, Naidu will file his papers tomorrow as it is the last date for making nominations.With the ruling NDA backing him firmly, 68-year-old Naidu's victory seems easy.A BJP Rajya Sabha MP from Rajasthan, Naidu is a Minister for Urban Development, Housing & Urban Poverty Alleviation, and Information and Broadcasting. 
Describing him as a fitting candidate for the office of Vice President, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he has always admired Naidu for his hardwork and tenacity.I know @MVenkaiahNaidu Garu for years.
