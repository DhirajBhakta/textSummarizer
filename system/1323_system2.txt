After a complaint filed by a child rights activist claiming that PETA websites carry sexual contents which are openly available to children, Tamil Nadu Commission for Protection of Child Rights has recommended to block all PETA web pages and take action against the sexually explicit ads shown on it.Enoch Moses, a social activist and researcher on children's behavior had earlier lodged a complaint with TNCPCR about how a child had complained to him that when she searched for PETA on Google, she was directed to images of nude models."
I found out how PETA has been using pornography and models to promote the cause of animal welfare. 
It is startling how PETA India has been allowed to use porn producers, promoters and other women who strip for money in advertisements, this is illegal in India", stated Enoch in his complaint.Enoch had also clarified that many of PETA's adds carry a double meaning quote which can provoke explicit thoughts in a child's mind.
