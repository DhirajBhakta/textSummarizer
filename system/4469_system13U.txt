I had to attend his son's wedding. 
So here I am, in India," Col Ghuman told PTI.The feeling was reciprocated by Patil, who said, "Saab's (Col Ghuman) mother treated me like her fourth son. 
I never felt humiliated as a 'buddy'," Patil, who retired in 2006, said.Col Ghuman retired the next year. 
Both were in the 25 Madras Regiment, where Patil's son, who got married recently, is posted as an Army jawan.The wedding took place at Patil's native place, around 50 kms from Belgaum.Col Ghuman also used this trip to reconnect with former jawans in his unit, and travelled to places like Mangalore, Kochi and Hyderabad to meet them and their families, before flying back to Canada.Col Ghuman's gesture comes amid reports that the Army is contemplating withdrawing combat soldiers working as sahayaks from peace stations across the country and post them back to their field formations.
