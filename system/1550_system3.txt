China today voiced its displeasure at the United States and at the outgoing Barack Obama administration for suggesting Beijing was blocking India's Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) bid, saying the matter was not "a farewell gift" to be given by Washington."
I just want to point out that NSG membership is not some kind of farewell gift for countries to give to each other," Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying told a press briefing, adding that she would not reiterate China's stand on the issue of non-NPT (Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty) countries joining the elite group. 
We need more time for deliberations so as to reach consensus and the committee will follow relevant procedure and rules of procedure. e will remain touch with relevant parties on this," she said.'
