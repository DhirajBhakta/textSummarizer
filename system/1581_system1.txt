Kumar told HT on Friday.In a zero waste colony, garbage is segregated into wet waste, dry waste and e-waste. 
The rag pickers will collect all the recyclable items from dry waste and the rest will go to the landfill site. 
This kind of waste segregation reduces the burden on landfill sites.Experts say that 50% of the garbage generated in a city is green waste that can be turned into compost. 
If household waste is segregated and recycled it will reduce the waste by at least 60%Segregate: Separate wet and dry waste by keeping a bin for paper, glass, wood, cardboard and another one for food and kitchen wasteCompost: Set up community compost bins in your area.
