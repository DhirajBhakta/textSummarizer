The JD(U) had demanded that Tejashwi come clean, or resign even as the RJD had maintained that he had done no wrong and he would not.However, the fresh BJP charges, earlier in the day, added to the worries and may have prompted the RJDs climbdown to some extent.Modi, who has been going hammer and tongs at Lalu & family for over a hundred days, claimed on Tuesday, that Tejashwi became the owner of 13 immovable assets while he was still a minor, and 13 properties when he was a full grown adult.I have proof that while the first 13 properties were transferred in his name when he was not yet 13, the rest came when had already grown a moustache and beard, which makes him culpable, Modi said.Modis refernce to the moustache and beard was an answer to Tejashwi, who had tried to stave off media queries last week  on the issue of the JD(U)s call for his resignation, saying, Can a boy who was yet to sport a moustache be involved in a scamHanding over a list of the assets acquired by the deputy CM to the media, Modi dared Tejashwi to make it public as to how he came to be owner of the properties, while he was not into any known business.
