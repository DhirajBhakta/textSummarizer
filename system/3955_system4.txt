Alleging that Infosys board was "misguided", Pai said the ""fundamental problem" was the pay hike given earlier to CEO Vishal Sikka "without any justification", because of which other executives were also expecting higher pay. 
"I think unless people at the bottom (software engineers) get good, regular hike, paying people at the top for doing nothing...for long period of time is totally wrong," Pai said. 
I cannot be paid one-tenth of what CEO is being paid," he said. 
Raising the CEOs salary was the "fundamental problem," and it could now lead to top-level executives and executive committee members seeking a pay hike, he said.
