The Mumbai Police arrested two senior officers posted at the Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport for allegedly letting people pass through immigration without due process. 
The officers - identified as Anil Surse (35) and Harshal Patil (33) - were arrested after a major case of illegal transportation of humans was busted last month. 
According to police officials, they uncovered the racket after arresting a woman who was travelling to Vancouver, Canada under a fake name and passport.
