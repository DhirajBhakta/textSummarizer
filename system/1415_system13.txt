I have nothing but gratitude.Kisenosatos ascent to sumos summit did not come easily: his historic victory on Sunday came at the end of his 73rd tournament as a professional, which is more than it has taken any other wrestler since 1926 to reach the top rank.His addition to the yokozuna ranks is also expected to help improve sumos image, after a decade in which it has been rocked by a series of scandals, including bullying, drug taking and allegations of match fixing.Kisenosato joins three other wrestlers at the rank of yokozuna, all of whom were born in Mongolia: Kakuryu, Harumafuji and Hakuho.
