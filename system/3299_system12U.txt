He congratulated the India Today Group for Hurriyat Truth Tapes and described the special investigation as the most compelling evidence ever gathered against the 'terrorists' in the Hurriyat because the Hurriyat leaders have themselves admitted that they are paid by Pakistan to burn schools in Kashmir.General Singh said the onus is now on the Mehbooba Mufti government to commence immediate and unprecedented clampdown on the Hurriyat Conference leaders who only care about the well being of their own families and are nothing but stooges of Pakistan.India Today aired a special investigative report where Hurriyat's Provincial President (Geelani Faction) Naeem Khan was caught on camera admitting that Pakistan is funding violence in the Kashmir Valley.Several top Kashmiri separatists were also caught on camera confessing to receiving funds from across the border.Some of them also admitted they raised money domestically, pledging to repeat the deadly events of 2016 if financed again.
