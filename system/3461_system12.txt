Rajgir (Bihar), May 4 (PTI) RJD chief Lalu Prasad today asked his party workers to tie old, non-milking cows outside the houses of BJP leaders to see if they really cared for the animal. 
He asked his party men to do so to substantiate his allegation that the BJP and the RSS are using the issue of cow protection for garnering votes. 
The RJD chief also asked his party men to desist from making any comments that could led to strains in the ruling Grand Alliance in Bihar.
