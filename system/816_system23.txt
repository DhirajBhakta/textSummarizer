Besides four Bharatiya Janata Party legislators, there were two more in the 70-member Delhi Vidhan Sabha who voted for Ramnath Kovind, the NDA-backed presidential candidate who emerged the winner  on Thursday.The ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP)suspects the two MLAs who cross voted could be among  the five suspended party legislators. 
While we know for sure Kapil Mishra voted for Kovind, the other one must be some suspended MLA only, said Saurabh Bhardwaj, AAP spokesperson and MLA from Greater Kailash.
