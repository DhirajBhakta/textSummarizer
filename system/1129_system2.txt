Kanpur, Feb 16 (PTI) AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi has described Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Akhilesh Yadav as two sides of the same coin, saying both "failed" to stop riots in their states as chief ministers. 
He too failed to stop the riots or give justice to Muslims," he said. 
Muslims should make the AIMIM candidates win," he said while addressing a public meeting in Colonelganj area here last night. 
Owaisi said he wanted to come to Kanpur earlier but was allegedly stopped by the administration as one of the ADMs said in his report that the visit will affect peace in the city. 
Akhilesh could not be even loyal to his father so now officers like these would be of benefit to him," he said. 
Hitting out at Akhilesh, Owaisi said the SP government in Uttar Pradesh promised to build schools and homes for Muslims but failed to fulfil them.
