?The university is the first in line to include the tax in the curriculum as Rajesh Jha, professor at Rajdhani College and an academic council member, pointed out that the executive is most likely to sanction the inclusion.Experts say GST should help widen the country's tiny tax base, free up internal trade, make it easier to do business and reduce the clout middlemen wield at state borders.
