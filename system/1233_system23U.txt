London, Feb 9 (PTI) Scientists may have analysed almost 5,000 orangutan "kiss squeaks" - purse-lipped consonant-like calls that appear to convey different messages to understand how human ancestors formed their earliest words. 
The team studied kiss squeaks in particular because, like many consonants they depend on the action of the lips, tongue and jaw rather than the voice. 
"Kiss squeaks do not involve vocal fold action, so they are acoustically and articulatory consonant-like," said Reis e Lameira, from Durham University.
