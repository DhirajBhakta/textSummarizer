Uttar Pradesh police have launched a probe against officials at the Vijay Nagar police station in Ghaziabad after a widely shared video of their alleged laxity and inhumane behaviour in dealing with a profusely bleeding teen stab victim before sending him to a hospital.Fourteen-year-old Qadir from Vijay Nagar had reached the police station around 11 am on Friday with a stab wound on his hand. 
The disturbing images showed that the boy roamed around at the police station complex in pain and blood running down his body as he covered his grievous injury with his shirt to stop the bleeding.However, the policemen kept him waiting for nearly 20 minutes and remained busy with their documentation and did not show up any urgency to rush him to a hospital.?
