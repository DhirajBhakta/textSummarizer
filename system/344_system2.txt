The Lok Sabha allowed the Indian Institute of Management (IIM) to award degrees to students, passing a bill on Friday that grants greater autonomy to the countrys premier business schools.The bill now goes to the Rajya Sabha for clearance.There are 20 IIMs in the country but none can offer degrees as the institutes are registered as societies under an 1860 law.
