A day after sharing the first poster of Carbon, the makers released the second poster flaunting Nawazuddin Siddiquis face on Tuesday. 
The tagline of the poster is quite interesting as well - A story of tomorrow.Carbon is a futuristic film set in 2067 and features Jackky Bhagnani, Nawazzudin Siddiqui, Prachi Desai and Yashpal Sharma in lead roles. 
Produced by Large Short Films, the short film focusses on global warming and takes a look at what the future could hold for us if we do not take any action today.
