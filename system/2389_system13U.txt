Third set: Federer 7-6, 7-6, 3-3 Berdych* (*denotes next server)Perhaps Federer cant get that missed break point out of his mind. 15-30 on his serve, and he looks annoyed. 
Thats three forehand winners in a row ... make that four, well nearly four because Berdych gets a racket to the ball but hes not getting that back into court, 5-1 Federer as they change ends ...
