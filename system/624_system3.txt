The Noida authority has decided to names all lanes in villages for easy identification of different pockets in each village. 
We have not yet finalised a date for starting the work but it will be soon, Rakesh Kumar Mishra, an additional chief executive officer of the Noida authority, said.There are 82 villages in Noida. 
These urban villages are located adjacent to upscale residential sectors but are yet to have basic civic amenities such as drainage, sewage network and roads, among others.We are working on preparing a robust municipal policy to ensure the development of civic facilities in villages on a par with urban areas. 
It has to be stopped immediately if Noida officials want to address civic issues in villages, said Raghuraj Singh, a Congress leader and resident of Bishanpura, near Sector 58, Noida.
