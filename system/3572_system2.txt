The  Delhi Universitys Department of Social Work (DSW) hostel has asked its residents to dress up properly while in the common room, reigniting a row over dress codes in colleges.A notice put up on April 27, however, did not specify what the definition of a proper dress was. 
Agnimitra said that she had also held a general body meeting with the students on the issue on Thursday.The notice further prohibited eating, sleeping, bullying or any other indecent behaviour in the common room, and warned of disciplinary against those violating the rules.The DSW notice comes a week after a girls hostel at IIT-Delhi asked its residents to dress in fully covered decent western dress or Indian dress for their House Day.
