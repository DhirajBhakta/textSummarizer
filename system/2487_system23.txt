A Canadian lobster fisherman who saved dozens of endangered whales after they became tangled in fishing nets has been killed  moments after a last successful rescue.Joe Howlett, from Campobello Island, New Brunswick, boarded a vessel off the provinces eastern coast on Monday to help rescue a north Atlantic right whale that had become heavily tangled in rope. 
While their findings are still preliminary and dont explain why the deaths have seemingly occurred within such a short time frame, they found signs of severe blunt trauma and bruising on two of the whales, suggesting collision with a vessel, while the third had been tangled in fishing gear for weeks.
