If she is a desi girl at heart, she is busy conquering the world with her work. 
From Bollywood to Hollywood, Priyanka has taken the leap of faith and it has indeed worked in her favour. 
When asked if the 34-year-old actor would want to settle down at a point where is in on a professional high, Priyanka said, "Nothing is a spoiler in life and they both are not mutually exclusive. 
She added, "If I do decide to take the plunge, it would be with someone who understands and supports that. 
At the end of the day, two people make a relationship work. 
It will take an understanding and prioritisation from both."
On the work front, Priyanka has signed her next Hollywood project A Kid Like Jake.
