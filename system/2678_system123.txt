Pakistan Cricket Board chief Shaharyar Khan has said India are scared of playing Pakistan after losing the Champions Trophy final at The Oval on June 18. 
India and Pakistan have not played bilateral cricket since 2012 when the latter travelled across the border for a short limited-overs tour. 
They say we'll play you in ICC matches but they won't play us otherwise," Shaharyar said at the Pakistani Prime Minister's reception of the Pakistan team.
