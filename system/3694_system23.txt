New Delhi, Apr 21 (PTI) Former chief minister Sheila Dikshit today said the MCD polls are a litmus test for the Congresss Delhi unit chief Ajay Maken and hit out at Arvinder Singh Lovely, who quit the party to join the BJP, terming him an "opportunist". 
She said that if Congress manages to win a "good number" of seats in the municipal corporation elections, then Maken will prove his detractors in Delhi Congress wrong.
