Aam Aadmi Party chief Arvind Kejriwal has written a letter to party workers, demoralised after the AAP's recent loses in Punjab and Goa Assembly elections. 
The party won 20 constituencies in Punjab, narrowly beating the Shiromani Akali Dal-Bhartiya Janata Party combine's 18 seats to emerge as the principal opposition in the state. 
In Goa, on the other hand, AAP failed to open its tally, losing in all the constituencies the party contested in.
