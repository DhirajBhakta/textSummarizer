A nine-year-old girl was among five people attacked by self-proclaimed 'gau rakshaks' in Jammu and Kashmir, news channel NDTV reported. 
"We have registered an FIR. 
I have asked DIG of Udhampur range to visit the area. 
Somehow we managed to flee from there. 
One of our children, a 10-year-old, is still missing. 
We don't know whether he is alive or dead. 
They even beat our elders very badly. 
They wanted to kill us and throw our bodies into the river." 
The Jammu and Kashmir incident comes against the backdrop of heightened cow vigilantism in the country. 
Just this month, the Alwar attack, in which one diary farm owner was killed by cow vigilantes, sparked nationwide furore.
