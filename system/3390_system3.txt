I start shooting it in June. ? Then there's Shubh Mangal Savdhan, a remake of a Tamil film, with Bhumi Pednekar.It is the antithesis of Vicky Donor. 
Shubh Mangal Savdhan is radical, quirky and a family film despite the topic.Are you happy with the movie offers coming your wayI am fortunate that I have been a part of two National Award-winning films in five years.
