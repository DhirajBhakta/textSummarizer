The University Grants Commission (UGC) has asked the universities across the country to install alarm bells in hostels to identify troublemakers  as part of the anti-ragging measures. 
If an institution fails to take adequate steps to prevent ragging or does not act in accordance with these regulations or fails to punish perpetrators suitably, it will attract punitive action by the UGC, reads the circular issued by Jaspal S Sandhu, secretary, UGC.So far, as many as 288 ragging-related complaints have been received by the anti-ragging call centre.
