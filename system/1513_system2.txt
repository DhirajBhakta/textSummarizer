In his column for the Daily Mail, Hussain heaped praise on the India captain before reminding England that they have five more opportunities to find a way to stop him.After losing the first ODI by three wickets, England face India in the second ODI in Cuttack on Thursday. 
@imVkohli on the cusp of breaking another record in Cuttack 'fortress'. 
An option England may well employ, if conditions dictate, is to bring Liam Plunkett into the side, put three men out and go for the short stuff, he wrote. 
England fast bowler Jake Ball too had said on Tuesday that they are aiming to unsettle Kohli with short balls. 
Hussain also suggested that England could pay Kohli some lip service in order to get under his skin. 
I would also like them to try to get stuck into him a bit verbally because he can have a short fuse. 
Try to work on his ego, like teams would attempt to do with Kevin Pietersen, wrote Hussain.Hussain had recently interviewed Kohli where the India captain admitted to being close to a very few people in his life. 
The man is something special but hes also human. 
And England have five more chances on this tour to prove they can come up with a way to stop him.
