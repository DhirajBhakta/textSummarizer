We found systemic compensation disparities against women pretty much across the entire workforce, Janette Wipper, a DoL regional director, testified in court in San Francisco on Friday.Reached for comment Friday afternoon, Janet Herold, regional solicitor for the DoL, said: The investigation is not complete, but at this point the department has received compelling evidence of very significant discrimination against women in the most common positions at Google headquarters.Herold added: The governments analysis at this point indicates that discrimination against women in Google is quite extreme, even in this industry.Google strongly denied the accusations of inequities, claiming it did not have a gender pay gap.The explosive allegation against one of the largest and most powerful companies in Silicon Valley comes at a time when the male-dominated tech industry is facing increased scrutiny over gender discrimination, pay disparities and sexual harassment.
