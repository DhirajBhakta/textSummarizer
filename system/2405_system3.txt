The next time you spot actor Kalki Koechlin, don?
The actor is apparently fed up of fans coming to her with the phone cameras in selfie mode. 
I wish people were more keen to talk to you, instead of taking a selfie. 
However, when it comes to socially relevant topics, Kalki feels that it?
We need advertisers, magazines, TV channels, even our newspapers to speak up. 
Everyone is guilty of endorsing fairness creams as much as actors. 
It has to be a collective decision, which needs to come from everyone. 
We still feel that they need to have a certain age and body type.?
