The Daily Telegraph compared Kohli to the United States President Donald Trump, saying "Kohli has become the Donald Trump of world sport".This comes after Kohli accused the Australian players of trolling Team India physio Patrick Farhart during the Ranchi Test."
Kohli eventually left the field with the physio and was back in action only on the third day.Later, Glenn Maxwell was seen mocking Kohli's injury when he imitated his action by clutching his right shoulder after his dive to save a boundary.
