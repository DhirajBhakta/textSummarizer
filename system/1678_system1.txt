From K J M Varma Beijing, Jan 7 (PTI) Chinese Met depatment today warned people in capital Beijing to avoid coming in contact with snow which officials said is "dirty" as it has absorbed pollutants which had enveloped the city since the final day of the last year. 
The Beijing weather forecast bureau said that snow followed by blasts of cold wind will clean up the air this weekend. 
The city witnessed slight snow but the smog continued to envelope the city. 
Chen said that inspections had found some cities failing to take effective measures following alerts, or their measures were impracticable.
