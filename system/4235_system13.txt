The move would allow anyone with Rs 5 in hand to access washrooms in even five-star hotels of South Delhi.According to an SDMC official, the decision has been taken on the advice of lieutenant governor Anil Baijal to explore the possibility of making toilets in restaurants and hotels open to public use.We want the hotels and restaurants to adhere to the decision in full spirit rather than wait for the SDMC to enforce it, said SDMC commissioner Puneet Goel.The hotels and restaurants will also need to put up display boards informing the public about the facilities.
