Cinegoers are always in for a treat when two powerhouse performers like Nawazuddin Siddiqui and Irrfan come together. 
The two have acted together in films like Paan Singh Tomar and Lunchbox, but their relationship is strictly professional, Nawazuddin said. 
In an interview with Mumbai Mirror, where he was talking about his relationship with the Khans (Shah Rukh, Salman and Aamir), he was asked about Irrfan."
I thought the fourth Khan we'd talk about would be Saif Ali Khan? 
I have no equation or relationship with Irrfan. 
Uska apna alag tareeka hai (My acting style is different from his)," the Gangs Of Wasseypur actor replied.
