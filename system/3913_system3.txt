"I never knew that I was born for music. 
My mom made the choice and she kind of predicted that I will be a music composer. 
The day I realized that music would be my passion and future was when I went to my studio that had no equipment. 
I felt practicing or learning about music was my investment. 
I felt its a jinx to go behind people."
