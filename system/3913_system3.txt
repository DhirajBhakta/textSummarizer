Hyderabad, Mar 5 (PTI) Academy Award-winning composer AR Rahman never realised that he was born for music and it was his mother who predicted that he would be a music composer. 
The music director said his mother made a choice and motivated him to make a career in music. 
The day I realized that music would be my passion and future was when I went to my studio that had no equipment. 
I felt one day I will have all types of equipment all over this place that I cant afford now." 
Rahman, who participated in a panel discussion here on "Creativity in Innovation," alongside fellow Oscar winner Resul Pookutty, said his only aim was to practice and learn music.
