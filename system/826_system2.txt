We are now going to redesign the plan and are working on a light metro project for the city that will cost less, reduce noise and vibrations," Sreedharan added.Metro projects are usually commissioned for cities with a population of over two million (20 lakh) residents whereas light metro, which is yet to be implemented in any Indian city so far, is proposed for those with population between one and two million. 
State governments, however, can plan or propose a metro system in advance, looking at a city's long-term transportation requirements, tourism indices and a comprehensive mobility plan is drafted to study the feasibility of the project.Comparing the construction of metro rail with China, Sreedharan pointed out, "While China builds 300 km of metro rail per year, India lags far behind with only 22 km a year."
