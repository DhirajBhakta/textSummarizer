Beside these two, nine more stations on this 59-km-long line will display original works of artists from across the country. 
The aim is to fill most of the interior walls at the concourse levels with paintings and photographs, a metro official said.On the Magenta Line, the stations have been re-designed where instead of the traditional walls and windows, the concourse and platforms will be made of cemented honeycomb design for enhanced ventilation.
