I know many people had problems and I feel sad for them but I am also happy that our Prime Minister has taken an initiative, so we should support him," Aamir said.Earlier in November, while launching Dangal's first single Haanikaarak Bapu in Mumbai, Aamir said that people should focus on the long-term impact of demonetisation for national interest and ignore short-term hiccups.On that note, since November 8 when Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced his demonetisation move, 25 people died all over the country for being unable to obtain cash from banks or ATMs for basic day-to-day activities.
