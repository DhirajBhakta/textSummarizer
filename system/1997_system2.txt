From an American Diplomat to investment bankers, college students and young entrepreneurs; 24 cyclists will pedal more than 250 kms every day through five states to create awareness about human trafficking and child labour. 
With over 1.35 lakh children gone missing in 2015, this group will travel between India Gate and Gateway of India and visit houses on the way to tell people about the menace of child labour. 
It says trafficking for bonded labour, domestic service, forced begging and commercial sex exploitation is widely prevalent in India. 
Despite the intricate, overarching provisions of the Child Labour (Prohibition) Act, 1986, India is home to millions of child labourers employed in hazardous and non-hazardous occupations, a majority of whom are victims of trafficking,?
