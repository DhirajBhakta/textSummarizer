In wake of a major drug bust earlier this month in Hyderabad, actor Rana Daggubati said it worries him and its really dangerous to know that school children have been involved in this racket. 
The Telangana Prohibition and Excise Department had seized 700 dots of LSD worth Rs 20 lakh and 35gm of MDMA -- commonly known as Ecstasy -- worth Rs 1.4 lakh from three peddlers. 
The month-long investigation brought to light the drug trade in Hyderabad, which involves not only Tollywood stars and MNC professionals, but also school students from reputed institutions.Commenting on the drug bust scenario, Rana said, ?
t give a damn if you take drugs.?
