I am just a national observer, whose job is to monitor the sport of wrestling and give feedback to build a good squad for future Olympics," Sushil said.Last year, in the run up to the Rio Olympics, Narsingh and Sushil were involved in a bitter court battle, which was followed by a dope scandal that resulted in the eventual suspension of the former.It all started with a tussle for an Olympic berth in the men's 74kg freestyle category after the WFI reneged on its promise of holding a trial to decide who among Sushil and Narsingh would represent India in the Rio Games.In the process, Sushil felt short-changed and even took the legal recourse but could not get a showdown with Narsingh as had been promised to him by the federation after an injury prevented him from competing in the Olympic qualifiers.
