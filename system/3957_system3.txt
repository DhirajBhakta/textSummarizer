When singer-actor Suchitra leaked a private photo of actors Rana Daggubati and Trisha Krishnan having an intimate moment, netizens went into a tizzy. 
While Suchitra claimed that her account was hacked, the actors themselves did not comment on the issue. 
At the book launch of The Rise Of Sivagami, a prequel to the epic saga Baahubali, Rana was asked about his response to the whole SuchiLeaks controversy.The actor replies, "You think I really give a sh*t?" 
He later told IndiaToday.in exclusively, "It's you guys (the media) who made a big deal out of it, but I really don't give a sh*t. 
There were so many pictures. 
If mine made news, it probably means I'm more popular than the others. 
(laughs) I actually made a big joke out of it at the IIFA Utsavam, when I was hosting it."
Trisha and Rana have been linked together on and off for the last few years. 
However, they both have maintained that they are just good friends who have known each other for very long.
