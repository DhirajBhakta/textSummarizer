It was a departure that one of her colleagues described as rather stylish, coming exactly 25 years and a day since Alexandra Shulmans appointment as editor of British Vogue  and a century after the fashion bible was founded.With both a style and magazine described as a very British, Shulmans departure also marks the end of a rivalry much-loved by fashion journalists between her and the equally British Anna Wintour, editor-in-chief of US Vogue and said to be the model for the terrifying Meryl Streep character in The Devil Wears Prada.In departing, Shulman indicated that recent ventures beyond the magazine  a behind-the-scenes BBC documentary, Absolutely Fashion, and a well-received book, Inside Vogue: A Diary of My 100th Year  had made her realise there was a life beyond a magazine she had edited since the age of 34.I realised that I very much wanted to experience a different life and look forward to a future separate to Vogue, she said.During Shulmans tenure at Vogue  circulation has increased 12% to 195,053 in the past 25 years  she has championed both British fashion and London fashion week, now one of the big four fashion events.She has a reputation for supporting British designers without quite fitting the image of a perfectly stylish fashion editor. 
Her first journalistic job was at Tatler, also part of Cond? Nast and which had also employed her brother as art director.Within eight years she was editing mens magazine GQ, where she increased sales by 30%, and two years after that she was made editor of Vogue.Her mother, Drusilla Beyfus, was Vogue associate editor in the 70s while her father, Milton Shulman, had been Vogue film critic, prompting Coleridge to say that Vogue was almost in her blood when she was appointed.Despite this, she has always told interviewers that having two parents who were journalists meant she had wanted to be a hairdresser, or a musician.In 2015 she wrote about how glad she was to return to work when her only son, now 21 and a history of art student, was 15 weeks old.Although she has refused to publish articles lauding diets or cosmetic surgery, Vogue has been no stranger to controversy.
