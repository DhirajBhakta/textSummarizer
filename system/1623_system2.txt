Ravi Kumar, who worked with Kotak Mahindra died on Monday, two days after Prem Singh jabbed him in Sadar Bazaar, where the bank branch was. 
It gave him the idea that an injection could be used to murder Kumar and make a quick buck, a source said. 
When the cousin was called for a pre-surgery check-up on December 27, Singh stole a bottle of Midazolam, an anaesthetic, from the hospital, police sources said.Singh told police he had planned to use only Midazolam, thinking Kumar would die of a drug overdose. 
He and Yadav bought the drugs and two masks from a chemist.
