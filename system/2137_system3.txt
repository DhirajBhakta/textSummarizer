Demonetisation politics seem to have gone one notch higher, at least in West Bengal.Moving one step ahead in voicing her protest, Mamata Banerjee, Chief Minister of West Bengal had sent a list of around 90 people who have lost their lives in the virtual struggle against demonetisation.In another attempt to register her protest against the demonetisation drive and to stand by the families of the people who have lost their lives in the ripple effect of demonetisation, she announced a government job for the bereaved family of one of them.Mamata Banerjee, announced compensation for the family of Kallol Roychoudhury, the 45-year-old who died of a stroke in Bandel, while queuing up to withdraw money from an ATM.A representative of the government was sent to inform the family at their Behala residence, that the post held by late Kallol Roychoudhury, state government employee would now be held by his wife, Seema Roychoudhury.Also read:Demonetisation a mammoth tragedy: Manmohan Singh"After Kallol's death due to stroke, I visited the family of the victim and told them that the post held by the late Kallol Roychoudhury will now be held by his wife, Seema Roychoudhury. 
After the CM's announcement, Partha Sarkar came and said that my job has been approved and I am very happy about it. 
I am very much grateful the government which has stood by our side and helped us in such unfavourable times, sped up the process.
