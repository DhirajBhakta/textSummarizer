DunkirkDirector - Christopher NolanCast - Tom Hardy, Fionn Whitehead, Mark Rylance, Harry Styles, Cillian Murphy, Kenneth BranaghRating - 5/5The moments spent in anticipation immediately before a new Christopher Nolan movie are often just as nerve-wracking as those spent watching the film.
And the electricity youve created  together  in the cavernous place of worship, could power a small town.I have experienced this sensation on four occasions, before four Christopher Nolan films, and each of those experiences were, and remain to this day, some of the most special Ive had inside a movie theatre.And yesterday, it happened again.Dunkirk, a film about men, created by men, is a force of nature  an elemental beast of a movie about finding the meaning of life surrounded by the meaninglessness of war. 
And like Inception, as layer after layer of Dunkirks nesting doll structure is uncovered, and when the three stories finally converge after almost two hours of merciless tension, the emotional release is pure ecstasy.Often, in order to build this tension, the experimental work of genius that it is, Dunkirk spends long stretches in silence. 
And these fine performers  mostly young stars (Harry Styles included)  convey wordlessly the torment raging in their characters minds.But because of these periods of silence, and because of Nolans refusal to rely on words (or, for that matter, a traditional structure) to tell his story, Hans Zimmers terrific score becomes crucial, and slowly, emerges as a character in its own right.
