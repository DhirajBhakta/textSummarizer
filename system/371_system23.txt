For almost half of the fiIm, Indu Sarkar remains the story of a docile, humble and meek orphan who surrenders to every whims and fancies of her husband even as she fights her own stammering and a lack of confidence.How this rather homely woman stumbles upon victims of a police raid in a slum, decides to fight for them and eventually becomes one of the most powerful voices of dissent during the Emergency, form the rest of the narrative.Neil Nitin Mukesh in a still from the film.While the film was publicised as a film on Emergency, it actually oscillates between a political drama and a typical Bollywood film about a couple. 
For example, why does Indu keep roaming around in a rickshaw/auto in the Turkman Gate area every time she needs to witness an eye-opener about the Emergency when she is otherwise driven around in her husbands car Or, for that matter, why do the protesters (led by Anupam Kher as Nanaji) keep naming each other when they meet inside a cinema hall to avoid getting caught by the cops Isnt the entire purpose of disguise defeated if they use the real names What is the reason, do you ask Well, Bollywood is the only word that comes to our mind.Kriti Kulhari in a still from the film.For those interested in the politics of films, there are two ways to look at Madhur Bhandarkars Indu Sarkar.One is to look it as a propaganda film against the Congress party, aims at showcasing the atrocities inflicted upon various communities during the Emergency.
