The tone of the discussion was set by the first question, when Putin was thanked for backing the school and for giving opportunities to so many children. 
I can also tell you that I even thought up the name: Sirius, said Putin, to prolonged applause.Sitting in an open-necked white shirt, with hundreds of schoolchildren arranged in circles around him, Putin took questions from those present and at times picked out cards with pre-written questions on them in a game-show-style format.Unlike Putins press conferences and phone-ins with the nation, which usually vary across a range of topics from foreign policy to the minutiae of regional problems, his discussion with the children was divided between talk about their own achievements in sport, music and science, and questions about Putins personal life and preferences.I like chatting with my friends, reading historical books, listening to music and doing sport, said Putin when asked what he does in his spare time. 
The discussion quickly moved on, with a synchronised skating team telling Putin it was their dream to have a photograph with him on ice: Putin said he would be happy to oblige.Major foreign policy questions were also absent from the discussion and there was no talk of the alleged Russian interference in the US elections or Putins recent meeting with Donald Trump at the G20 summit.
