Mumbai, Mar 26 (PTI) Banker Uday Kotak has said the BJPs win in the recent state polls is positive for economic reforms and the government should now focus on re-activating "animal spirits" of the private sector to invest. 
"I think we just need to make sure that we are focused on growing the economy, getting the private sectors animal spirits back and that will create jobs," Kotak told PTI over the weekend. 
A two-thirds majority in the countrys most populous state, that sends the maximum number of Parliamentarians (80 to the Lower House and 30 to the Upper House, where Opposition Congress is in majority), will help BJP gain upper hand after the 2018 elections to the Rajya Sabha.
