A Somerset cheesemaker has offered a ?500 reward after two of its finest vintage cheddars were stolen during a prestigious show. 
The judges at the Yeovil show had crowned the two hefty blocks of cheese champion and reserve champion and the specimens were being left in a marquee overnight so that they could be admired by members of the public next day. 
The cheesemakers at Wyke Farms in Bruton, Somerset, were devastated that two of the best blocks they had ever produced have vanished. 
Rich Clothier, a third generation cheesemaker and the managing director of Wyke Farms, said he believed the thieves had targeted the prize-winning cheddars and may have been stealing to order.
