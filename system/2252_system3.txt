The idea is to systematically engage each and every stakeholder, Kumar said.According to him, the push this year is to make NDMC truly a green city and make the 48% green cover to 50%.The council  which looks after the Capitals high-profile neighbourhoods housing the power elite, embassies, top markets and fancy restaurants  plans to conduct weekly drives in big gardens, sides of wide roads, local parks and government offices and quarters.We are focusing on improving the quality of the greenery, especially on both sides of the big roads. 
We had sent our horticulture staff to Belgium, China, Japan, South Korea and Singapore to get international exposure, the NDMC chairman said.Apart from planting ornamental, herbal, shrubs, 28,000 indigenous trees like sheesham, peepal, neem tress, the council also plans to plant fruit trees like mango and jamun during the drive.
