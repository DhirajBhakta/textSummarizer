Illegal migrants from Bangladesh entering India is a contentious issue between both neighbours. 
While New Delhi contends large-scale influx from across the border, Dhaka has denied these migrants are their citizens.There was no such difference though when officials of both nations agreed on Thursday to construct gates along the border to allow free and safe passage for wild elephants.Setting up of the gates was one of the 18 points of action agreed between both countries at the 2nd Indo-Bangladesh dialogue on trans-boundary conservation of elephants held at Shillong.Trans-border migration of animals is a natural process.
