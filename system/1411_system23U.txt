I dont really take injury timeouts, but Stan already took his so I thought people wont be mad and Stan wont be mad. 
Fifth set: Federer 7-5, 6-3, 1-6, 4-6, 5-3 Wawrinka* (*denotes server): After three hours, Wawrinka is serving to stay in the match. 
Federer has to dig deep, but hes putting nothing into his shots now and eventually nets a backhand to gift Wawrinka a break point.
