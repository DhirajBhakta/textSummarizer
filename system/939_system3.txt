This is probably the first of its kind scheme for labourers, especially the homeless who do not have fuel and utensils for cooking.The meal  five rotis, mixed vegetable, rice, pickles and green chilies (and desert on Sundays)  will be served through saffron-coloured stalls. 
Our government has taken an initiative, chief minister Vijay Rupani,  who served piping hot meals to  workers at a stall in Narol area of Ahmedabad, said. 
The other two attendants will be managing crowds.Beneficiaries have to produce an identity card, either Aadhaar or voter card, and get themselves registered with the stall from which they wish to buy food every day.NGOs have been roped in to prepare the meal.
