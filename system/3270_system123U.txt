Kolkata, May 20 (PTI) ICSE and ISC candidates will now be able to have digital versions of their marksheets and certificates for accessing them anytime and anywhere. 
"Unlike the old practice when the candidates had to download the scanned image of the hard copy of marksheet, all they have to do now is to open an account with http://digilocker.gov.in and give their mobile number and follow the steps thereafter," Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE) Chief Executive and Secretary Gerry Arathoon told PTI today.
