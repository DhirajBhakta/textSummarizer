It was a departure that one of her colleagues described as rather stylish, coming exactly 25 years and a day since Alexandra Shulmans appointment as editor of British Vogue  and a century after the fashion bible was founded.With both a style and magazine described as a very British, Shulmans departure also marks the end of a rivalry much-loved by fashion journalists between her and the equally British Anna Wintour, editor-in-chief of US Vogue and said to be the model for the terrifying Meryl Streep character in The Devil Wears Prada.In departing, Shulman indicated that recent ventures beyond the magazine  a behind-the-scenes BBC documentary, Absolutely Fashion, and a well-received book, Inside Vogue: A Diary of My 100th Year  had made her realise there was a life beyond a magazine she had edited since the age of 34.I realised that I very much wanted to experience a different life and look forward to a future separate to Vogue, she said.During Shulmans tenure at Vogue  circulation has increased 12% to 195,053 in the past 25 years  she has championed both British fashion and London fashion week, now one of the big four fashion events.She has a reputation for supporting British designers without quite fitting the image of a perfectly stylish fashion editor.
