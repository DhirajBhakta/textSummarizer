By Yoshita Singh New York, Jul 1 (PTI) Indian-Americans, Adobe chief Shantanu Narayen and former US Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, are among 38 immigrants to be honoured this year for their role in helping advance the countrys society, culture and economy. 
Narayen and Murthy will be honoured with the prestigious Great Immigrants annual award on USs independence day on July 4. 
Murthy, 39, born in the UK and a Harvard and Yale alumnus, was appointed by former President Barack Obama in 2014, becoming the first-ever Indian-American to occupy the post and also the youngest ever surgeon general of the country. 
However, Murthy was dismissed this year in April by the Trump administration. 
He was among a select group of CEOs who met Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Washington for a roundtable during the leaders visit for first bilateral meeting with President Donald Trump this week. 
Among other honorees include Canadian-origin social entrepreneur Jeff Skoll, who has been awarded the 2017 Carnegie Medal of Philanthropy, PayPal cofounder of Ukrainian origin Max Levchin, Iranian-origin philanthropist and entrepreneur Hushang Ansary. 
Each year since 2006, the corporation has recognised the contributions of naturalised citizens, and for 2017, the honorees represent more than 30 different countries of origin, a wide range of personal immigration stories, and a high-level of professional leadership in numerous fields. 
"Our annual tribute to Great Immigrants demonstrates the richness of talent, skills, and achievements that immigrants from around the world bring to every sphere of American society," said Vartan Gregorian, president of Carnegie Corporation of New York. 
"This campaign reminds us of the debt the United States owes to generations of immigrants who become citizens and contribute to the progress of this country.
