A woman fell 60 feet from one of the US tallest bridges while taking a selfie but miraculously survived after landing on a trail below. 
The Sacramento-area woman was expected to survive after she fell 60 feet off the restricted area of the Foresthill Bridge near Auburn, California, while trying to take a selfie, the Placer County Sheriffs Office said. 
Goncharuk also confirmed that "they were taking a picture on the bridge, and then the big bolts that are holding the beams together, she stepped on them kind of weirdly and lost balance and fell backwards." 
Police in a California county put out a Facebook post after she fell, warning camera-toting thrill seekers that, "You can lose your life and none of that is worth a selfie!"
