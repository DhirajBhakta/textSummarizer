Steve Smith today slammed his 17th hundred in only his 90th Test innings as Australia maintained their dominance over Pakistan in the rain-marred Boxing Day Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. 
He became the fourth quickest in terms of innings to score his 17th hundred behind Sir Don Bradman (50), Sunil Gavaskar (81) and Matthew Hayden (82). 
Interestingly, this was Smith's third consecutive Boxing Day Test hundred.
