My election as President of India is to represent all such Kovinds toiling away to make a living, he recalled the day he was elected.Kovinds father was a farmer who had to sell off a piece of land to fund his sons education in Kanpur. 
If at all Kovind represents any section, it is that of the majority of India--rural, agrarian, economically and socially underprivileged. 
						Kovind unsuccessfully contested assembly elections twice and Lok Sabha polls once.
