Four terrorists were killed today by the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) and the Jammu and Kashmir Police, after they attempted to attack a CRPF camp at Sumbal in Bandipora district of Jammu and Kashmir. 
They lobbed grenades, and later opened fire. 
The first terrorist, who tried to enter the camp by lobbing grenades, was gunned down in first few minutes. 
After a heavy exchange of fire, the other terrorists were forced to retreat, and were gunned down by Sumbal Police personnel, who had surrounded them. 
A large cache of arms and ammunitions - including 4 AK 47 rifles (one of which was fitted with UBGL), and over a dozen grenades - have been recovered.
