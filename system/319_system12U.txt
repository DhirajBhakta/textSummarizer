You can now file complaints on potholes online. 
The pothole application, Star Grade, which had gained popularity last monsoon, was restarted after complaints related to potholes poured in. 
Launched by the Thane Municipal Corporation two years ago, the app had become popular among residents. 
The application started functioning two days ago. 
However, it is still in testing phase and we havent formally launched it.
