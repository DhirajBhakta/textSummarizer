Defence Minister Arun Jaitley today brushed aside China's warning about the ongoing face-off along Bhutan border.Asking India to withdraw troops from Bhutan border areas, China said that India should recall the 1962 war and learn a lesson.Responding to the remarks made by the Chinese foreign ministry, Arun Jaitley said, "India of 2017 is different from India of 1962. 
India is not entering into any other country's land what China is doing, Jaitley said.Earlier, Bhutan issued a demarche to China yesterday over the construction of a road towards its Army camp in Zomplri area of Doklam and asked Beijing to restore status quo by stopping the work immediately.The demarche by Bhutan comes at a time when there is an ongoing face-off between Indian and Chinese troops in the Doklam (also known as Donglang) area of the Sikkim sector.Doklam is a disputed territory and Bhutan has a written agreement with China that pending the final resolution of the boundary issue, peace and tranquillity should be maintained in the area.
