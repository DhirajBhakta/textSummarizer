A study by TRAFFIC, an arm of World Wildlife Fund (WWF), recently found that at least three systems of traditional medicine in India - Siddha, Ayurveda and Unani - prescribe peacock feather and other parts in various potions.The practice is being followed by quacks and hospitals, including those funded by the ministry of AYUSH, in states like Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Delhi Gujarat and Rajasthan.The Indian blue peafowl (Pavo Cristatus) has considerably reduced in numbers over the years thanks to destruction of their habitats by farmers protecting their crops and poachers. 
While domestic trade in the naturally shed tail feathers collected outside protected areas is allowed, export of these is prohibited.The study says, "Bhasma and churnam (peacock feather ash) were sold in many siddha drug stores in Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Delhi Gujarat and Rajasthan, and is used to cure hiccups, vomiting and morning sickness among other illnesses).""
The Rebari community in Rajasthan use ash of peafowl feather mixed with honey to cure asthma, whereas ash of peafowl feathers mixed with coconut oil is used for headache.
