Only 26 malls and commercial centres on Mehrauli-Gurgaon (MG) road, Golf Course Road and Sohna Road will offer free parking in their basements, the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) announced on Wednesday.The MCG had earlier said it will waive property tax on basements if the same were used to provide free parking. 
Building owners said the revenue from parking is higher than the gains from the property tax waiver.The updated list is in the public domain on the civic bodys website  www.mcg.gov.in.
