Traditional welcome for #TeamIndia in Cuttack #INDvENG pic.twitter.com/X1JD3VAuKw BCCI (@BCCI) January 18, 2017Perhaps (England captain) Eoin Morgan has to take one side of the field out of the equation, go around the wicket and hide the ball outside off stump while telling his bowlers that he does not mind if they go for the odd wide or two, wrote Hussain in his column.Then they could try to keep him off strike a bit more than they did in Pune on Sunday by allowing the lad at the other end a single off the fifth or sixth ball, or bring the field up to Kohli towards the end of the over to try to make him play a big shot that could lead to his downfall..
Hussain also suggested that England could pay Kohli some lip service in order to get under his skin.
