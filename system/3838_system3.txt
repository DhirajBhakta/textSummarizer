Hyderabad, Apr 12 (PTI) The tightening of H1-B work visa rules in the US would be advantageous to Indian IT firms as they would shift more work offshore and also be in a position to improve their billing rate, says industry veteran T V Mohandas Pai. 
"The new H1-B regulations are very good for Indian IT, and bad for companies which try to use it for cheap labour. 
They are unnecessarily getting a bad name, because some fly-by-night operators are trying to do body-shopping and spoil the name of the entire (Indian IT) industry," he said. 
It will increase the billing because it will create artificial scarcity in America, and allow Indian companies to bill more for work because there are not enough Americans to fill the positions that are needed", said Pai, who is Chairman of Manipal Global Education Services and Aarin Capital.
