The men agreed but one of them refused and began verbally abusing Pawan and Narayan.Sensing that the men could attack them, Pawan took out his pistol, made a phone call to Bindapur police station and asked for back-up. 
While he was asking for more policemen to come to the spot, one of the men suddenly stood up and threw chilli powder in Pawans eyes, said a senior police officer.
