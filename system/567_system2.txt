The institutes now have technology-driven teaching interface in all classrooms, bio-metric entry for students, paperless admissions and mobile apps for better teacher-parent interaction. 
Parents are also happy as they get daily updates about their childs attendance in college without even having to visit the institute, said AH Rizvi, president, Rizvi Education Society. 
Also, CCTV cameras were installed in all its institutes and all laboratories were equipped with latest technology. 
Our attempt to digitise almost all our academic functions right from admissions to the generation of results has been very fruitful.
