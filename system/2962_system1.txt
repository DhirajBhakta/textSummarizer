By Abhishek Anshu New Delhi, Jun 18 (PTI) Unsuccessful love stories have found a very vivid description in a Supreme Court observation wherein it has said that women sacrificing their relationship to accept parents decision is a common phenomenon in India. 
The top court noted that the woman might have first "unwillingly" agreed to go by her parents wish but later she apparently changed her mind which appeared from the scene of the incident where garlands, bangles and vermilion were found. 
The court noted that the victim and the accused were in love with each other and the womans father had testified in the court that due to caste differences, his family had refused to give their nod to the couple to marry.
