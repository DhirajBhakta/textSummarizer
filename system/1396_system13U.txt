"On the occasion of the Spring Festival, I wish all the people of China a happy and prosperous Year of the Rooster," Modi said in his greeting posted on his Chinese social media platform, Weibo. 
China formally bids farewell to the year of Monkey today and will herald the year of Rooster tomorrow. 
Chinese lunar calendar years are grouped into a 12-year cycle, with each year assigned an animal symbol: rat, ox, tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, sheep, monkey, rooster, dog and pig.
