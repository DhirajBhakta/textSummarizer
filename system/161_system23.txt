Manisha is all set to work with actor Ranbir Kapoor in an upcoming biopic based on actor Sanjay Dutts life.For someone who has worked with almost all the leading names from the fraternity during the 90s, including the likes of Aamir Khan, Shah Rukh Khan, Salman Khan, Anil Kapoor among others, it must have been a different experience teaming up with the current breed of actors. 
And I believe its not about senior or younger co-stars; for me, its always great to share screen space with good actors, says Manisha, who worked with newcomer Shreya Chaudhary in Dear Maya.
