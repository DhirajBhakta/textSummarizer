To help its commuters in case of medical emergency, Central Railway along with 'Magicdil' have established 24X7 'One Rupee Clinics' at 14 different stations. 
While choosing the station to establish 'One Rupee Clinic', Magicdil asked for data from railway authority regarding where most number of accidents take place and which are the most crowded stations."
We wanted to provide affordable Medical service to common people. 
We came to know about railway plan to start such scheme thus we offered them our plan and idea. 
Railways had helped us with the infrastructure to build these clinics," said Rahul Ghule of Magicdil.
