Mumbai, Jul 5 (PTI) Ratna Pathak Shah, who has played mother to Fawad Khan in "Khoobsurat" and "Kapoor & Sons", says she would like to see more participation across nations in arts and working with Pakistani ators is not an "insurmountable problem". 
I dont know what that says about the people who went after Fawad and saw to it that hell never get to work again.
