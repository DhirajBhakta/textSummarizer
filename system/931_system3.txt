The casting director of Babumoshai Bandookbaaz, Sanjay Chouhan, has said he never made the fair and handsome remark about actor Nawazuddin Siddiqui, that has led to a controversy.Bengali actor Bidita Bag (L) and Bollywood actor Nawazuddin Siddiqui pose for a photograph during a promotional event for Babumoshai Bandookbaaz.
						Hours after Nawazuddin tweeted a cryptic message on racism in Bollywood, it was widely reported that Chouhan, in an interview to a daily, had said that after Chitrangada Singh quit the film they had to find an actress who could look good opposite the actor as they cant cast fair and handsome people with Nawaz. 
It would look so weird.Siddiqui tweet late Monday, Thank you for making me realise that I cannot be paired along with the fair and handsome because Im dark and not good looking, but I never focus on that.Thank U 4 making me realise dat I cannot b paired along wid d fair & handsome bcz I m dark & not good looking, but I never focus on that. 
All I said was the film needed actors as good as Nawazuddin. 
I dont know from where the fair and handsome bit came but I never said the words, Chouhan told PTI.  
I would never want to hurt Nawaz sir or the film by giving such statements. 
I havent spoken to him yet, but I am deeply saddened by how the comments, which I never made in the first place, have turned out, he added.
