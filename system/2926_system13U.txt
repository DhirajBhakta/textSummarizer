The Supreme Court today denied interim bail for controversial former judge CS Karnan. 
Karnan was sentenced to six months in jail by the Supreme Court, which ordered his arrest after finding him in contempt for defaming the judiciary. 
A two-judge vacation bench of Justices DY Chandrachud and Sanjay Kishan Kaul today said it cannot modify the original order as it was passed by a seven-judge bench and asked Karnan's lawyer to bring the matter before the chief justice of India after the vacations.
