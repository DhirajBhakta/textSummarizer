Then I made Zakhm, again a sensitive movie based on my fathers real life story, was a box office disaster. 
One that you make to jolt the audience and the other is the kind you make to soothe the jolted. 
I am not interested in making movies that only 10 people will watch and will get critical appreciation at some festival.Also, Jism is a film she stands by.
