The fantastic box-office run of Namastey London prompted director Vipul Shah to announce a sequel to his 2007 hit - Namastey England. 
From the leading lady to the story, Namastey England has been the subject of speculation for a while now. 
Apparently, Akshay is happy with the choice of replacement for him.A source told the publication that Arjun is a fan of the original film, and loved the script of its sequel. 
But he wanted to make sure that Akshay had no problems about the franchise moving forward without him, before signing on the dotted line. 
Last month, Akshay and Vipul who have been close friends and have collaborated on a dozen films over the last two decades, mutually agreed to go ahead with Arjun.
