New Delhi, Apr 27 (PTI) Priyanka Gandhi Vadra today said her finances had nothing to do with those of her husband Robert Vadras or his company Skylight Hospitality which is under Haryana governments scanner over its land deals with realty major DLF. 
A statement from Gandhis office came after a media house purportedly made a query to Robert Vadra asking whether a portion of the money he had received from the DLF was used by his wife to buy properties in Faridabad in Haryana.
