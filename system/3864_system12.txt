We have identified two plots near Okhla and Janakpuri (west) metro stations. 
We will construct 460 flats in Janakpuri and 90 in Okhla. 
The flats will be allotted on the basis of a draw and people can apply as soon as we open the scheme. 
This will enable high rises to come up in these areas and make for denser colonies.
