Only 26 malls and commercial centres on Mehrauli-Gurgaon (MG) road, Golf Course Road and Sohna Road will offer free parking in their basements, the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) announced on Wednesday.The MCG had earlier said it will waive property tax on basements if the same were used to provide free parking. 
Soon afterwards, 45 sites offered free parking but now some of the owners have agreed to pay the property tax instead of offering free parking service.
