To meet the increasing demand for parking space near Metro stations, the municipal corporations have decided to construct stack parking lots next to 10 busy stations across the city.Stations that have been identified for the project are Punjabi Bagh, Madipur, Udyog Nagar, Nangloi, Mundka, Pratap Nagar, Ghitorni, Okhla, Indraprastha Estate and Seelampur. 
All the correspondence has been done between the two departments and we have initiated the tendering process for the construction, said Gupta.The six stack parking lots in north Delhi are expected to provide space for 7,897 cars. 
Explaining the reasons for constructing multi-level car parking lots, north MCD additional commissioner Renu Jagdev, said: The plots near Metro stations are small in size and located along the main roads so we cant construct multi-level car parking facilities, she said.With the help of computers, information about the vacant slots would be easily accessible. 
We have got the letter from DMRC regarding transferring of plots and we are working over the project of developing car parking lots here soon, said Puneet Goel, commissioner, SDMC.Meanwhile, North MCD has completed the tendering process for construction of stack parking lots opposite Lok Nayak Jai Prakash hospital, Asaf Ali Road.
