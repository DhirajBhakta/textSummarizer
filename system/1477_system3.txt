In the run up to Republic Day celebrations followed by Assembly elections, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, home minister Rajnath Singh and BJP President Amit Shah face threat from Maoists and several other quarters.Top intelligence sources said inputs have been received according to which leaders of the front organisations of the CPI(Maoist) have urged their central leadership to target the election rallies of the Prime Minister, union home minister Rajnath Singh and BJP President Amit Shah.Sources said central intelligence agencies have carried out a special briefing to Special Protection Group in this regard, to apprise them of possible threat perceptions to the PM ahead of Republic Day and Assembly elections.Since the top leaders will be visiting various places for the election campaigning, Maoist cadres have urged the leadership to target them during their campaign for Assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh and Punjab. 
They have further suggested to carry out serial IED blasts in Eastern UP by deploying 'suitable cadres' from outside, while promising to provide assistance to carrying out the task.Also read | PM Modi wants a week-long Republic Day-like Independence Day
