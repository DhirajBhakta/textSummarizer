Even if Trump decides to veto the legislation, it has already passed both chambers by veto-proof margins.In a statement, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said that while the President supports tough sanctions on North Korea, Iran and Russia, the White House is reviewing the House legislation and awaits a final legislative package for the Presidents desk.The legislation passed the House the same day Trumps son-in-law, Jared Kushner, spoke to the House intelligence committee about the Trump campaigns ties to Russia.
