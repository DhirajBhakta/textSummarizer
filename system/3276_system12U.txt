But the Global Seed Vault, buried in a mountain deep inside the Arctic circle, has been breached after global warming produced extraordinary temperatures over the winter, sending meltwater gushing into the entrance tunnel.The vault is on the Norwegian island of Spitsbergen and contains almost a million packets of seeds, each a variety of an important food crop. 
It was not in our plans to think that the permafrost would not be there and that it would experience extreme weather like that, said Hege Njaa Aschim, from the Norwegian government, which owns the vault.A lot of water went into the start of the tunnel and then it froze to ice, so it was like a glacier when you went in, she told the Guardian.
