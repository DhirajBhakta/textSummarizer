New Delhi: Delhi Police are planning to question YouTuber Sumit Kumar Singh, also known as Crazy Sumit, and his associate Satyajeet Kadyan once again after the two girls seen in their prank video claimed they were unaware the video would be uploaded on the Internet. 
The girls, one from Gurgaon and the other from Delhi, were questioned on Tuesday at their respective homes by crime branch officials in connection with the molestation case registered after the video surfaced early this month.
