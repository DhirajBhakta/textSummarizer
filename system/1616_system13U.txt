Almost three-quarters of Japans biggest coral reef has died, according to a report that blames its demise on rising sea temperatures caused by global warming.The Japanese environment ministry said that 70% of the Sekisei lagoon in Okinawa had been killed by a phenomenon known as bleaching.Bleaching occurs when unusually warm water causes coral to expel the algae living in their tissues, causing the coral to turn completely white.
