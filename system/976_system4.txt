A BSES engineer died and four persons were injured today as their car rammed a tree while allegedly being chased by a mob during an anti-power theft drive in south west Delhi's Jaffarpur Kalan area, a BSES spokesperson said. 
The police, however, refuted the claim and said the engineer died in a suspected case of rash driving. 
A senior police officer said the BSES teams were provided adequate police force for the raid which went "successfully". 
A case has been registered in the matter, he said, adding the four injured BSES team members have been admitted to a hospital. 
Power theft has taken shape of an organised crime and active police support is needed to curb this menace," said the BSES spokesperson.
