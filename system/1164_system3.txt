New Delhi, Feb 14 (PTI) NHRC has received over 14,600 cases of bonded labour since its inception and this "anathema of civilised humanity" still persists in many sectors, chairperson Justice (retd) H L Dattu today said. 
"Bonded labour is one of the worst violations of human rights and also the dignity of life. 
It is a crime against humanity, anathema of civilised humanity, denial of inalienable human rights, antithesis of decent work and a blot on civilised society that jolts the conscience of the entire nation," he said. 
"From its inception till January 31 this year, 14,614 cases have been received by us, out of which 13,266 have been disposed of." 
Maximum violation cases were reported from Odisha (9,983) out of which 9,899 have been disposed of, according to a report released by the NHRC. 
"In order to monitor the compliance of recommendations on bonded labour, the Commission has also devised a detailed reporting questionnaire format and sent it to all the states/union territories. 
"As long as there is poverty, unemployment, underemployment, landlessness, migration, indebtedness, the pernicious bonded labour system will continue," he lamented.
