If Shahid Kapoor's brother has made headlines for grabbing a project with Iranian filmmaker Majid Majidi, the 21-year-old actor's personal life too has also caught the fancy of many.

If reports are to be believed, Shahid doesn't want Ishaan's personal life to take away the focus from his debut film Beyond The Clouds.
