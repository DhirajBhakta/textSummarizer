Rooting for equal pay for equal work, Swara says, I am not saying that if I, being a female actor, work for 10 days, I should expect the pay that an actor gets for 100 days of work. 
If you see in Hollywood, women are taking up this whole question of equality and I think thats fantastic, so why cant Bollywood take its cue from them says  the actor, stating that no movement gains momentum unless people fight for it.Nobody gave black people civil rights in the 50s on a platter; they suffered for a very long time.
