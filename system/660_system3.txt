While more than 6,000 were cut in 2014-15, around 4,600 and 4,700 trees were felled in 2015-16 and 2016-17.The petition on change.org says that tree felling will be done right in the heart of the city with several schools, hospitals and residential areas in the vicinity. 
Here is your chance to take action about this situation by protecting the lungs of Delhi, the trees, the petition reads.Forest officials have already issued permission for cutting down the 1700 trees around Pragati Maidan as per Delhi Preservation of Trees Act and the required fees has also been deposited.Another Delhi-based environmentalist has started a separate crowdfunding campaign to raise funds for printing costs, lawyers and court fee to stall the losing 1,713 healthy big trees in the heart of the city that will lead to severe health damage to lakhs of residents.Advocate Aditya Prasad, who had filed the RTI that revealed the plan to fell these trees, has earlier said, They have not got any Environment Impact Assessment clearance but still got permission to cut these trees from the forest department.
