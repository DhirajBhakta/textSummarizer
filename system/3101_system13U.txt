What do goats prefer to have when they are really hungry Well, this one apparently likes its food in 'pink' rather than 'green'.A 'hungry' goat chewed Rs 66,000 that its owner had kept in the pocket of his trouser in Siluapur village in Kannauj district of Uttar Pradesh. 
The trouser was kept close to where one of his goats was tied.
