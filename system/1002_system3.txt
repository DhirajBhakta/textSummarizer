The new chief executive of Indias embattled National Stock Exchange (NSE) said on Monday his immediate priority was to resolve a regulatory investigation facing the countrys largest bourse and improve relations with stakeholders.Vikram Limaye took over the NSE on Monday, with the exchange facing a probe from market regulator the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) about whether company employees provided unfair access to co-location servers to select brokers.Co-location servers are placed at the site of exchanges to speed up algorithmic trading.The probe has delayed a much-anticipated initial public offering (IPO) of the NSE that bankers had said could raise up to $1 billion.Limaye, a 50-year-old finance industry veteran who was previously CEO of infrastructure lender IDFC Ltd, also has to face regulatory scrutiny after NSE suffered a technological glitch that caused widespread disruptions in trading last week.The immediate priorities for me are to resolve the co-location issue with SEBI, Limaye told Reuters in an interview on Monday. 
Limaye said the NSE was in talks with SEBI to settle the issue of unfair access to brokers.
