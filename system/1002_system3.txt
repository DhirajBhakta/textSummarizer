s embattled National Stock Exchange (NSE) said on Monday his immediate priority was to resolve a regulatory investigation facing the country?
The immediate priorities for me are to resolve the co-location issue with SEBI,? 
Limaye told Reuters in an interview on Monday. ?
Then, we need to obviously improve various stakeholder relationships whether it?
s with SEBI, government, clients, media, employees,? 
he added. 
Limaye said the NSE was in talks with SEBI to settle the issue of unfair access to brokers. ?
That we believe will be the fastest way to resolve this,? 
Limaye said. ?
We will have to file an official application for consent in order to start that process.?  
Sources told Reuters last month that the NSE was in talks with the market regulator to settle the issue, in an effort to move ahead with its listing, and accept a penalty. 
SEBI has not said whether it would be open to a settlement.Limaye said he had ?
no visibility? 
on when the exchange could go public, as the regulatory probe had to be resolved first.He said he would also focus on better communication to fix the bourse?
s image. ?
Unfortunately, what we haven?
t done a good job (at), historically, is communicating,? 
he said. ?
So, I firmly believe even the co-location issue could have been managed a lot better.?
A number of high-profile executives have left the NSE, including co-founders and former CEOs Chitra Ramkrishna and Ravi Narain.Limaye is the first chief executive to come from outside the exchange?
