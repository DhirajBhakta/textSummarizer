Those ranked in the top 10% in terms of risk were more than three times as likely to develop Alzheimers during the course of the study, and did so more than a decade before those who ranked in the lowest 10%.Rahul Desikan, of the University of California  who led the international effort, said the test could be used to calculate any individuals risk of developing Alzheimers that year.That is, if you dont already have dementia, what is your yearly risk for AD onset, based on your age and genetic information, he said.The so-called polygenic hazard score test was developed using genetic data from more than 70,000 individuals, including patients with Alzheimers disease and healthy elderly people.It is already known that genetics plays a powerful role in Alzheimers.
