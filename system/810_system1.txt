against parties New Delhi, Jul 20 (PTI) The Delhi High Court today granted six weeks to the Centre to comply with its 2014 order directing action against political parties violating foreign funding norms. 
Justice A K Chawla observed that the six months granted in the March 28, 2014 order has not been extended by it and, therefore there was no reason for the government to not comply with it. 
The lawyer appearing for the Centre submitted that more time was required for compliance as the record was voluminous. 
The court had on March 21 this year issued notice to the Centre on a contempt plea alleging the government took no action against political parties violating foreign funding norms despite the court order.
