And the couple was recently babymooning in Greece. 
Flaunting her baby bump in a white gown, Esha looks radiating in this picture clicked in Greece. 
In an interview with Mumbai Mirror, Esha revealed that she not only decided on the country for her babymoon but also took an appointment with a local photographer, Dimitris Psillakis, to capture the perfect moments during her trip. 
She added that getting ready without a hair-dresser, make-up man or spotboy was a different experience. 
"It was just Bharat and me and he helped me iron my dresses, carried my stuff on the VIP ferry and even helped me change. 
I would suggest that every parents- to-be get a maternity shoot done to smile over with their child in later years" she added.
