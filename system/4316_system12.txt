Prabhat Shankar Singh, who is posted as Inspector at APM Police station, on Thursday put his job as a policeman first and got his son arrested on charges of liquor smuggling.Indrajeet, the son of the police officer, had lately joined a group of liquor smugglers ahead of the festival of Holi. 
He had smuggled 25 bottles of foreign liquor into Bihar to sell it at a high price in order to make a huge profit, but before he could succeed with his plans, his father came to know about it.
