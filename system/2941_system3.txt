West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Monday expressed her surprise at the BJP's decision to announce Bihar Governor Ram Nath Kovind's name as the NDA presidential candidate.In her very first reaction, Mamata said, " I felt I fell from the sky"."
I don't know him," she said in her statement. 
"Candidate should be someone who will be beneficial for the country," Mamata said on her way to Netherlands for a three-day official trip, adding that she will attend the meeting of opposition political parties on June 22 after which any decision could be announced. 
I love everyone but we have to know the background, the person and then only can we support the candidature," she said while justifying her position.The Trinamool Congress supremo said she had spoken to a few opposition leaders who were equally surprised by the BJP's announcement.
