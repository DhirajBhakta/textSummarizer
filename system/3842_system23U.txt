The textbook, which The News Minute reports is titled Health and Physical Education Textbook, goes on to reason that even Miss World and Miss Universe beauty pageants take the 36-24-36 body shape into consideration while judging their contestants.An image of the section of the textbook comparing the physical and anatomical differences between males and females was initially posted on social media by a Twitter user named Anuj Khurana.The textbook doesn't stop at just female body shapes.
