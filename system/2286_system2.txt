s assent, the Maharashtra government published the Act in the gazette. 
The bill was cleared by the state legislature in April and was sent to the President for his approval. ?
The Act has been cleared by the Central government. 
The Act also has a provision to withdraw cases with the consent of victims and permission from a court.
