The Ministry of Civil Aviation has issued an order withdrawing the special VIP privileges accorded to RJD chief Lalu Yadav and his wife, former Chief Minister of Bihar, Rabri Yadav at Patna airport.The letter, accessed by India Today, is dated 21 July and directed to the Bureau of Civil Aviation, the nodal agency responsible for airport security.This will basically disallow the two leaders from driving up in a vehicle to the aircraft on the tarmac. 
This privilege now stands withdrawn with immediate effect.Sources indicate that this privilege has been withdraw given the fact that neither leader enjoys any constitutional position at present.This latest development could open a fresh round of animosity between the BJP and the Mahagatbandhan, especially after the recent financial investigations against Lalu Yadav and members of his family.
