The video, which has over 50 million views and 1.3 million shares on Facebook, shows a midwife craddling the newborn girl across her chest with one arm and is amazed to see the baby walk on her own. 
WATCH: Newborn baby walks immediately after birth, takes internet by storm "I was trying to wash her here and she keeps getting up to walk," said the midwife pointing with one hand to where she initially tried to lay the baby down to give the child her first bath. 
The midwife is then seen lifting the baby up and returning the infant back to the original position but in an astounding burst of strength, the little girl refuses to lie down on her front, pushes up onto her legs and resumes her astonishing journey across the neonatal table once again.
