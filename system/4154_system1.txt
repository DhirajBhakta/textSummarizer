For this pitch he bowled exceptionally well and showed why he has joined Ashwin as the world's best bowler", said the India captain, who posted a picture of himself with the 'bowling machine' on route to the series decider.No doubt Kohli will depend on the deadly duo of Jadeja and Ashwin to seal a record extending seventh straight series win.Off to Dharamshala for the last one.
