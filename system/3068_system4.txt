A 17-year-old girl in Tamil Nadu's Erode district who was being treated for epilepsy and weight loss by a herbal treatment centre died under mysterious circumstances. 
He also added that when they called in between June 2-6 to inquire about their daughter's health, the authorities said she was responding well and relaxing. 
According to testimony of BhakyaSri's neighbours, they saw the staff of the treatment centre drop off the freezer box on June 3. 
Clash between the family members of BhakyaSri and Balaji broke out when he visited the family at the Coimbatore hospital. 
BhakyaSri's relatives claim that Naveen Balaji who runs the herbal treatment centre in Erode is a fraud and has no authorisation from medical bodies or the government.
