Has Winnie the Pooh done something to anger Chinas censors Some mentions of AA Milnes loveable but slow-witted bear with a weakness for honey have been blocked on Chinese social networks.Authorities did not explain the clampdown, but the self-described bear of very little brain has been used in past memes comparing him to the Chinese president, Xi Jinping.Posts bearing the image and the Chinese characters for Winnie the Pooh were still permitted on the Weibo social media platform on Monday.
