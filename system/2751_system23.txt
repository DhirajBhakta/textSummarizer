China has called off the annual media trip that it organises for journalists to travel to Tibet. 
One of the participants, Vijay Naik, Convenor of Indian Association of Foreign Affairs Correspondents said, "The invite was received but because the tensions have increased the Chinese may have thought of letting things cool down and let the atmosphere become conducive again for the media programme to resume.
