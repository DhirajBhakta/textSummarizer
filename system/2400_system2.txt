has been proposed at Rs 50,000, while bidding for numbers from 0002 to 0009 will begin from Rs 30,000.Last month, the department had sold the hottest number ?
from date of birth to astrological and numerological numbers that are believed to bring prosperity.Gauging the high demand for numbers like 0786, 1111, 9999, 7777 and 1000, the transport department has set a base price of Rs 20,000 for them. 
While all these premium numbers will be issued only through e-auctions, another category of numbers like 0100, 2222, 8888, 6666 and so on will be sold for Rs 15,000 on first-come-first-serve basis. 
At present, the system is manual, where the service is available only at the Mall Road licensing office.For nearly two years, the government had stopped issuing numbers from 0001 to 0100 to two-wheelers as this proposal was being prepared. ?
