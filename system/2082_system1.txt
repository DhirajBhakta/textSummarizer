Not in the traditional sense anyway.Al Ponte is one of the businesses participating in Wasted, a pilot project running in Amsterdams Noord district which incentivises households to recycle their plastics by rewarding them with discounts at local businesses.When prospective participants sign up they are given bags labelled with unique QR codes, enabling the schemes organisers to apportion the correct credit to each household once the filled bags have been collected. 
With Wasted, however, it has said is keen to support the Cities Foundations goal to connect waste management with supporting local entrepreneurs.In a recent survey of Wasted users, 52% of respondents said they had improved their waste disposal habits as a result of using Wasted and 23% said they had reduced their total plastics consumption.
