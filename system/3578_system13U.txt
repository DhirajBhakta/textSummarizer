Samajwadi Party leader and former Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav today said if remote-controlled electronic chip in fuel dispensing machines can dupe unsuspecting consumers then electronic voting machines (EVMs) can also be hacked in a similar way.In a tweet he said, "When petrol can be stolen from remote by a chip without any internet connection then it can happen in an EVM also," he said.Yadav, who lost the recent UP Assembly polls, said we have to stop the misuse of technology.The Uttar Pradesh Special Task Force (STF) had yesterday raided seven petrol pumps which were allegedly using remote-controlled electronic chip in fuel dispensing machines to dupe unsuspecting consumers.STF sleuths found that an electrician used to instal these chips in petrol dispensing machines which reduced the fuel output.The chip costing around Rs 3,000 when installed in the dispensing machines reduced the output by nearly five to ten per cent.
