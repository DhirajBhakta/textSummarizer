The Kerala high court on Monday rejected the bail plea of Malayalam superstar Dileep, who was arrested two weeks ago in connection with the attack and sexual assault on a popular woman actor. 
Rejecting the bail plea, the court said it was a serious case and his release at this juncture would affect the ongoing investigation. 
The court agreed with the prosecution that if he was released he would influence some of the witnesses.
