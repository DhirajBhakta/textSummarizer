New Delhi, Mar 30 (PTI) Comedian Radhika Vaz today said that the sexual harassment allegations against The Viral Fever (TVF) founder Arunabh Kumar were sad but not shocking. 
The reason I say this is because what surrounds sexual harassment has not changed. 
"Personally, I dont know this guy, but I was told that this is an old story which everyone knew and no one talked about," Vaz said while addressing a session, which was held as part of the She Leads India conference by UN Women in partnership with SheThePeople.TV.
