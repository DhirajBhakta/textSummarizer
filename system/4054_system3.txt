"However, the rapid international developments in recent years have provided Switzerland with two new forms of exchange of information in the area of taxes: spontaneous and automatic exchange of information (AEOI)," it added. 
"Within the scope of the OECD and G20 project to combat base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS), the spontaneous exchange of information was specified for the first time in the area of advance tax rulings, where there is a risk of base erosion or profit shifting." 
Switzerland has also been issuing notices to several resident Indians and even Indians settled abroad after the receipt of request from India for "administrative assistance", including information about their Swiss bank account details.
