"I don't even know how many people's deaths Jadhav is responsible for," Musharraf added.The former Pakistani army chief also slammed his country for appearing in the International Court of Justice, which this week put a stay on Jadhav's death sentence. 
"It was wrong that India went to the ICJ," Musharraf said, adding, "Pakistan should not have gone (to the ICJ". 
Musharraf went on to cite the example of the United States executing two German nationals in 1999 despite an ICJ provisional ruling putting a stay on the death penalty awarded to the two.
