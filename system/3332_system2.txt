Bryson William Verdun Hayes, known as Verdun, broke the world record on Sunday, completing a tandem skydive with three generations of his family at an airfield in Honiton, Devon. 
Hayes, who said a parachute jump was something he had wanted to do since he turned 90 ? 
He was named Verdun after his father, Joseph Hayes, who served in the first world war as a sapper with the Royal Engineers and who fought during the Battle of the Somme, wrote home to his pregnant wife, Mary, from the frontline suggesting they call their child Verdun after the 1916 battle. 
A spokesman for the Royal British Legion said Hayes would be celebrating with a glass of champagne.
