The cycle of security check will speed up and our staff will get more time to check suspicious baggage,? 
CISF DG OP Singh said.Recently, CISF had conducted trial runs in two phases at 12 airports and concluded that stamping of baggage tags could be dispensed with after certain modifications of security architecture in Security Hold Areas of the airports and installation of high definition CCTV cameras. 
the official added.During the trial run from December 15-22, security check areas were monitored through CCTV cameras to ensure no passenger skips the mandatory check. 
Now, if one passenger is stopped, others in the queue can move on to the boarding gate after security check.
