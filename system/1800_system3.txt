New Delhi, Dec 30 (PTI) India today slammed Pakistan for labelling certain Indian political parties and social organisations as terror outfits, calling it a "desperate attempt" at deflecting international focus from Islamabads complicity in "spawning" terrorist groups like LeT, JuD and JeM. 
External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Vikas Swarup said Pakistan Foreign Ministrys statement yesterday linking political parties and social organisations to terror was "absurd even by pakistans standards".
