Passengers travelling between Noida and Kalkaji are likely to be the first one to experience the travel with the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) scheduled to complete the work on this section of phase-III in May.It will then apply for inspection, which usually takes a month, which means the line can be opened for public by June.The new trains will run on two new lines - Pink (Mukundpur-Shiv Vihar) and Magenta (Botanical Garden-Janakpuri west) and will cover a distance of 96 km. 
Initially, train operators will run the trains, but gradually, driverless operations (on the Unattended Train Operation or UTO mode) will be possible.During the trial runs, the interface of the metro train was checked to ensure that there was no physical infringement with civil infrastructure and the various subsystems of coaches were also tested.Later on, in stages, the new signalling technology was implemented on this corridor; the Communication Based Train Control (CBTC) had to undergo rigorous testing.
