It is why the Indian team is excited and eager to see that Hardik Pandya develops his potential. 
He has the pace and is an aggressive batsman. 
I think Hardik can be that guy going ahead, especially playing so much cricket away from home. 
If he grows in confidence  you see someone like Ben Stokes, what he does for England. 
He brings in a great balance as an all-rounder. 
A comprehensive victory and #TeamIndia take a 1-0 lead in the series #SLvIND pic.twitter.com/gTJKnWneMH BCCI (@BCCI) July 29, 2017He definitely has. 
He bowled really nicely on a wicket that wasnt offering much and he kept it in the right areas. 
He used the bouncer well. 
So, he is a great asset, and specially his batting. 
And his fielding is also tremendous. 
I have a lot of faith in him as far as any format is concerned.
