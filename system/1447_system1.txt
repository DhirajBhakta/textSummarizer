Kaabil, his sole release of 2017, takes on Shah Rukh Khan-starrer Raees at the box office on January 25. 
He calls Kaabil a "small film with a large heart". 
Rakesh Roshan makes box office prediction Kaabil and Raees will be battling for audience's attention. 
I guess once you make peace with that you just see what happens. 
I feel even in times when friends have to stand opposite each other, as long as there is communication there is understanding. 
Perhaps, I am looking for something that is a little rarer or I want to use my films to express my own self through my interpretations of my experiences.
