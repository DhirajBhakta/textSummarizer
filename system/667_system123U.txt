The rule changes on blood donations will be implemented from November in Scotland, and early 2018 in England.Transgender people will also be able to choose their legal sex more easily as part of the equalities reforms announced by Justine Greening. 
This government is committed to building an inclusive society that works for everyone, no matter what their gender or sexuality, and today were taking the next step forward, the education and equalities secretary said.We will build on the significant progress we have made over the past 50 years, tackling some of the historic prejudices that still persist in our laws and giving LGBT people a real say on the issues affecting them.Reforms making it easier for transgender people to chose their sex legally, by removing the need for a medical diagnosis of gender dysphoria and speeding up the bureaucratic process, will go out to consultation in the autumn.Greening said she wanted to reduce the stigma faced by trans people, who have to provide evidence that they have been in transition for at least two years before they can apply to change their gender legally.Theresa May indicated earlier this week that she was preparing to reform the Gender Recognition Act, saying: When it comes to rights and protections for trans people, there is still a long way to go.The reforms have been widely welcomed by LGBT campaigners.
