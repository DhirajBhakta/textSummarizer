Mumbai, Jun 17 (PTI) Mika Singh says singers should be given priority over film stars when it comes to doing playback in films. 
Of late a lot of female and male actors have done playback for songs in their films and also managed to strike a chord with the audiences. 
"I believe if an actor is the right fit for a particular song then by all means he or she should be given the song. 
On the ongoing trend of popular songs from the 90s being recreated, be it AR Rahmans "Hamma Hamma" or dance number "Tamma Tamma", the 40-year-old singer says he is in favour of it.
