The army spokesman brushed aside questions about claims the militarys hidden hand was the driving force behind the JIT investigation, saying the Pakistan army is not directly connected. 
The six-person JIT panel included one member from the military intelligence agency and another from the Inter-Services Intelligence directorate, the countrys top spy agency. 
He was originally nurtured by the military as a civilian politician who would protect their interests, and he served as prime minister twice in the 1990s. 
Sharifs legal team and the opposition will be given a chance to contest the JIT findings and Sharif is also expected to be summoned to appear before the court in coming days or weeks. 
Opposition politicians say Sharif is concocting claims of conspiracy to save his skin and argue that if he really wanted to protect democracy he should step down.
