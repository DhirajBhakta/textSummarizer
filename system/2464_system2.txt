 The terminal decline of the Congress party can only be revived by a leadership change, says historian and biographer Ramachandra Guha, who suggests that the partys top job be handed over to Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar.Stressing that it was his fantasy, Guha said on Tuesday if there was a friendly take-over of the party by the JD-U leader, it would be a match made in heaven.For the Congress is a party  without a leader and Nitish is a leader without a party, Guha said at the launch of the 10th anniversary edition of his book India After Gandhi.Nitish Kumar, he held, was a genuine leader.Like Modi, he has no family burden, but, unlike Modi, he is not a megalomaniac.
