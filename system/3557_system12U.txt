Karachi, Apr 30 (PTI) Bollywood superstar Salman Khans much awaited film "Tubelight" might not hit the screens on Eid in Pakistan as some local filmmakers have started a movement to stall the release of the film. 
The filmmakers along with the Film Distributors Association and the Film Producers Association want to ensure better business for Pakistani films during the Eid holidays.
