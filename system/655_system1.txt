Free WiFi access at suburban railway stations in the city has become a headache for railway authorities, with non-commuters and miscreants using the facility to watch porn during the night.?
We have received complaints that the WiFi on stations is being used for wrong reasons,? 
Frequent complaints have been received particularly at Mumbai Central station.?
Railway officials now plan to urge RailTel, the agency providing the service, to shut the WiFi after midnight or after the last suburban train departs from the stations. ?
said Parihar.They also plan to ask RailTel to devise methods to prevent misuse of the facility at stations from where outstation trains depart. ?
