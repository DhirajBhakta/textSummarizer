With the two Metro stations and a railway line and major traffic crossings within one km, the Public Works Department (PWD) wants to have the longest skywalk of the capital at ITO. 
Recently, the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) constructed a subway, allowing pedestrians to cross Vikas Marg, BSZ Marg and the DDU Marg. 
PWD said one foot overbridge (FOB) should connect the footpath of Sikandra Road (towards Tilak Marg) to the parking lot near Pragati Maidan Metro station across Mathura Road. 
The deck of this overbridge could be linked to the proposed structure being constructed by the DMRC near Pragati Maidan Metro Station. 
One ramp may also be provided for access to Tilak Marg footpath near Supreme Court.Read: Kejriwal says no more odd-even in Delhi, focus now on public transport system?
