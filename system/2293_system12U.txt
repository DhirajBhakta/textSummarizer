The decision comes after the Noida authoritys traffic cell found out that 80% of road markings in the city are either washed away or fade out on their own. 
Once the road and lane marks are in place, they will help the traffic police in regulating the flow of traffic, Sandip Chandra, head of the Noida authoritys traffic cell, said. 
The traffic police recently installed close circuit television cameras (CCTVs) at intersections in Sector 57/22 and Sector 2/19 for better traffic management.
