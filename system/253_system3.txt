Newcastle United owner and Sports Direct boss Mike Ashley has won a high court battle over a ?15m deal allegedly made in a London pub, calling time on a case that will be long remembered for days of evidence concerning excessive alcohol consumption.The case revolved around investment banker Jeffrey Blues allegation that during a night of heavy drinking at the Horse and Groom pub near Sports Directs Oxford Street store in January 2013, Ashley agreed to pay him ?15m if the companys shares doubled to ?8.However, on Wednesday, Mr Justice Leggatt, who had said he found the case was a lot more interesting than some, ruled that no one would have thought what Ashley said in the pub was serious.The Sports Direct senior management meetings certainly show that Mr Ashley is happy to combine discussion of business matters with the consumption of alcohol, the judge said in his ruling. 
Ashley was not in court to hear the judge deliver his ruling, but his lawyers said he had won a comprehensive victory.In a statement, the businessman said: The only reason the Sports Direct share price exceeded ?8, and will hopefully do so again, is because of the sterling efforts of all the people who work at Sports Direct.Ashley, who gave evidence at the trial, said he could not recall making the alleged deal and if he had it would have been obviously just banter.He had told the court that he had met Blue, who was then an adviser to Sports Direct, and three other finance specialists at the Horse & Groom pub and consumed a lot of alcohol.I cant remember the details of the conversations that we had in the pub as it was a heavy night of drinking, Ashley had said. 
If I did say to Mr Blue that I would pay him ?15m if he could increase [Sports Directs] share price to ?8, it would be obvious to everyone, including Mr Blue, that I wasnt being serious. 
He said the work ethic at Sports Direct was like nothing else I have ever seen, but he said Ashley sometimes did business in unorthodox ways and in unusual venues.Blue claimed Ashley once vomited into a fireplace after a senior management meeting that was effectively a pub lock-in and said the businessman would take naps under tables at boring meetings.Lawyers told the judge that Ashley had run up legal bills of ?1.5m, and Blue bills of ?1m-odd.
