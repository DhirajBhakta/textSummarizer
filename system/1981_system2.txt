The police control room (PCR) department has decided to procure high-definition (HD) video cameras (handycams) and keep them in 1,000 PCR vans that are the first responders to any crime scene. 
The handycams would be used by the in-charge of patrol vans to record the crime scene, gathering of people, and areas around the spot, apart from recording statements of the witnesses, all in digital format. 
This video recording will be handed over to the investigating officer, who can use it as digital evidence in the court. ?
But as our PCR vans act as first responders to any crime and reach the spot first, sometimes in less than a minute or two, it will be easy for us to capture such key evidence using the video cameras,? 
Another police official said that the video cameras can be used for multi-tasking. 
Apart from crime spots, patrol van officials can use video cameras during demonstrations, riots, processions and other public gatherings, which at times witness violence as protestors resort to stone pelting on public servants and damaging private and public property.
