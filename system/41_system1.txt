After accusing director Anees Bazme and his friend and associate Mayur Barot for non-payment of dues, comedian Sunil Pal is now planning to take legal action against both of them. 
About eight months back I was asked by Anees Bazmee and his friend Mayur Barot to perform at a family function (in Mumbai). 
But I never got my payment. 
And while Anees Bazmi got busy with his film, Mubarakan, Barot kept on telling me that they were getting a cheque drawn out for me. 
After so much of drama when nothing happened, I even messaged Anees Bazmi saying that I am planning to file a police compliant.
