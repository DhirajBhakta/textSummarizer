To show Sanjay Dutt as a human being, as a biopic only works when you show the human side of a person, and not the glories but the downfall as well (was not easy).Though Ranbir seems to have got the look right, he is extremely nervous about the film.I dont know if I have nailed it or not (referring to the film).
