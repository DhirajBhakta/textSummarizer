President Donald Trump on Wednesday called the Russia sanctions legislation he signed into law seriously flawed and urged Congress to not use the measure to hinder US efforts to resolve the Ukraine conflict with its European allies.The legislation is aimed at punishing Moscow for interfering in the 2016 US presidential election and for its military aggression in Ukraine and Syria, where the Kremlin has backed President Bashar Assad.
