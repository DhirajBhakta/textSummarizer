Talking about the experience of venturing into a new industry and language, Dhanush told Mumbai Mirror: I just finished one English film and I believe a script should convince me to take off from one industry to another and do complete justice to it. 
It should have meaning. 
He is a street magician. 
Its his extraordinary journey as he ventures into the real world to figure it out. 
Its told in a funny, entertaining way. 
The script has a lot of heart, humanity and so much to give to society. 
Does he plan to produce Hollywood films I will be co-producing Hollywood films very soon. 
Talks are on. 
We are discussing a few scripts and collaborations but its at a very early stage right now, he said, adding its a great time to be doing international films. 
The world is shrinking and everyone is majorly interested in Indian films now. 
They are watching our films, they are hiring Indian stars and they like our song-and-dance format. 
If you notice they are even adapting them in their films. 
Its a very healthy change and I think its the best time for me to do something like this.Follow @htshowbiz for more
