Kathmandu, Dec 19 (PTI) A 15-year-old girl has died in Nepal after she was banished to a shed outside the village during her menstruating cycle, under an ancient Hindu custom outlawed by the government over a decade ago. 
The practice, known as chhaupadi, is a social custom of keeping menstruating girls and women in a narrow shed outside the village, under the ancient Hindu custom which views menstruating girls as unclean. 
The practice was outlawed by the government in 2005, but it is still prevalent among many village communities in Nepal, especially in western Nepal.
