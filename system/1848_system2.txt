The suspension will continue till a committee, set up on Tuesday to investigate the matter, submits its findings.The academic council on Monday approved a University Grants Commission notification making entrance test for PhD and MPhil as only qualifying criterion, amid protests from teachers and students. 
The new system makes interview the only basis for preparing merit list for admission. 
Students allege that the new move will lead to discrimination.The university had claimed that some protesting students entered the meeting hall after a handful of faculty members called them inside.There is sufficient evidence in form of the statement by the security guards, who tried to stop the students.
