Flat buyers who will lose their homes following  the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) order to reduce the height of 70 buildings in the flight path of aircraft said they were being made scapegoats by the authorities. 
They said on Monday that they had bought the apartments legally and blamed officials for not checking the rules while approving construction plans.  
A survey conducted by the Mumbai International Airport Ltd and the Airport Authority of India between 2010 and 2011 identified 137 structures and classified them as obstacles.A resident of one of the affected buildings at Santacruz said most of the residents in these buildings are senior citizens. 
Our entire building will be damaged if we demolish even one floor, said a ground-floor resident of a Ghatkopar building affected by the order. 
The court said after finding rampant violations of height norms by private developers, the authorities could not sit back waiting for an accident to take place.
