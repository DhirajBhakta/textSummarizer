But..when Sheena and I tried to tell Peter about this lie, he asked Indrani and she strongly refuted it, insisting this was not true and that they were in fact her siblings and not her children.Indrani would have then been extremely angry with Sheena for disobeying her most important instruction and undermining her.Peter didn't know the truth of Sheena and Indrani's relationship. 
If Peter asked Indrani whether there was any truth to these apparent revelations, she only denied it and claimed they were sisters.Evidently, there was no financial motive.Whatever Indrani may have done, was for her own personal reasons.Peter was clearly not involved.Peter was never allowed, by Indrani, to visit Guwahati to meet her parents, obviously, as that would have led to him becoming aware of the truth about Indrani's past and her kids. 
NOT a case of misleading because of complicity in any crime..but a situation where he really believed that Sheena was okay because his wife was assuring him of such - and he was trying to tell me the same.In early 2012 when Sheena contacted Indrani with a view to clearing the air, Indrani had told Peter that Sheena had in fact contacted her with a view to leaving the relationship and wanted Indrani's help to do that (Peter was lied to). 
Therefore, any of Peter's subsequent reassurances given to me that Sheena was fine, or must be fine, were as a result of him believing what he had been told, which Indrani also corroborated to make believable by sending a couple of SMS messages to herself and to Peter, from Sheena's phone, claiming the same.Any and all who inquired about Sheena, were peddled this same story by Indrani and were equally convinced - it was not just Peter who believed her.Peter was clearly not involved, nor was he aware of any crime allegedly perpetrated by Indrani, despite claims to the contrary.These important circumstances, which to date have not been pointed out, very clearly show that Peter was NOT 'in the know' nor was he involved in the crime.Hence, charges against Peter ought to be dropped.
