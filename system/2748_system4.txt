It was also decided that in case of any dispute, the matter will be referred to the panchayat head and not to the police.? ?"The panchayat was held in the village on Saturday on liquor prohibition, betting and use of gutkha. 
Everyone agreed over the order issued over mobile use," Phauran Singh, Panchayat head (panch patel) said.The decision to prohibit the use of mobile phones or wearing of jeans was arrived at by consensus during the panchayat meeting. 
The decision to keep the matter before panch patel in case of a dispute is also right," Jagdish, a villager, said.PROTESTS AGAINST LIQUOR PROHIBITION In several villages of Rajasthan, there have been protests in favour of liquor prohibition with the villagers seeking a total ban on sale and consumption of alcohol. 
However, this decision of panchayat prohibiting girls from wearing jeans or carrying mobile phones has not gone down well with the district administration."
