Mumbai, Apr 4 (PTI) Actor Manoj Bajpayee says the credit for his success in the film industry goes to his "so called" flop movies. 
In my life, Ive mostly seen rejections and failures and flops. 
I am a living example of an actor making a career out of flops," Bajpayee told PTI. 
The actor, best known for featuring in critically acclaimed films like "Satya", "Shool" and "Gangs of Wasseypur", says movies which do not work at the box office, are often the ones which have longer shelf life.
