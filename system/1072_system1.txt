Itanagar, Feb 20 (PTI) Development of the North East is essential for the countrys economic development, Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh said today while criticising the previous UPA regime at the Centre for neglecting the region for years. 
"And now Prime Minister Narendra Modi had rechristened the Look East Policy as Act East Policy to fast track development in the region after years of negligence," he said. 
The senior BJP leader said the Centre was keen on development of Arunachal Pradesh which is "strategically located sharing international borders with China, Bhutan and Myanmar", and assured full support to the state for its all round development.
