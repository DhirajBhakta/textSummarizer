These will start arriving next week.Cash transactions reduced significantly at Metro stations after the November 8 recall of old 1,000 and 500-rupee bills, with more and more people switching to digital mode of payment.The DMRC also accept payments through Paytm, but many commuters prefer to recharge their smart cards from the customer care counters.For the past few days, the card swipe machine has not been working at the Vaishali Metro station. 
What is the point of going cashless when you dont have the infrastructure, said Raksha Singh, a regular Metro commuter.The DMRC will install 400 new card swipe machines for the facilitation of online transactions at its stations as part of a new tender.By and large, the point-of-sale machines used for card payments are working fine across the system.
