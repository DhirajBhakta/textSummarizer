However, actor Narayani Shastri, who will be playing the role of a mother in Rishton Ka Chakravyuh has a different opinion. 
According to the actor, the small screen is progressive in many ways.Indian television shows women in a  strong light. 
That justifies progression, says Narayani, adding that her role in her next is also of a strong fiercely independent woman, who is both manipulative and opportunistic, who yet gives utmost importance to her family.
