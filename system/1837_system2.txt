The number of applications for driving licences has doubled in 24 hours after the online mode for payment of fees was reintroduced.While the number of daily applications for driving licences stood around 300 till December 24, it shot up to over 700 on the next working day, which was Monday. 
After our online system of seeking appointments at Motor Licensing Offices (MLOs) and payments was streamlined, the number of applications has increased to more than 700 in a single day, a government official said.In a bid to introduce cashless transactions in its daily functioning, the transport department on Tuesday installed point of sale (POS) devices at all its 13 MLOs, enforcement offices and headquarters. 
The POS machines get overloaded and stop functioning for a while, he said.The department, however, stated it is keeping a tab on the issues being faced and is already working resolving them.Earlier this month, Transport Minister Satyendar Jain had directed his department to start accepting fees and payments in the form of bank drafts and pay orders for all transport services in view of cash crunch after demonetisation.
