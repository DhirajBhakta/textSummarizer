While films such as Paa (2009), The Dirty Picture (2011), and Kahaani (2012) worked wonders and won her critical acclaim, there have been lull days at the box office when films such as Bobby Jasoos (2014), Kahaani 2 (2016) and Begum Jaan failed to make an impact.Does it bother Vidya Its heartbreaking when a film doesnt work after you have put in so much in it. 
But I feel that all actors go through hits and flops, it never makes me question myself, says Vidya, adding that she doesnt care about others opinions as  everyone is entitled to an opinion.
