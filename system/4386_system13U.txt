Because of the new Metro station at ITO, the crowd at the junction has gone up, said a PWD official.Currently, there is only one foot overbridge on the Vikas Marg in front of the ITO building. 
Recently, the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) constructed a subway, allowing pedestrians to cross Vikas Marg, BSZ Marg and the DDU Marg. 
PWD said one foot overbridge (FOB) should connect the footpath of Sikandra Road (towards Tilak Marg) to the parking lot near Pragati Maidan Metro station across Mathura Road.
