Former Arunachal Pradesh Chief Minister Kalikho Pul's wife Dangwimsai Pul today withdrew from the Supreme Court her petition seeking CBI probe into the death and the allegations levelled in a purported 'suicide note' he left behind.
??Withdrawing her petition, Dangwimsai Pul said she does not want the apex court to decide her matter as it "will lead to closure of other remedies".
