Diana Penty follows her heart when it comes to selecting film roles. 
Therefore after Cocktail (2012), she took a break before signing her next, Happy Bhag Jayegi that released last year.?
And in Parmanu I will be doing little bit of action, something that I have never done before,? 
, so did Diana fear losing out on her audience after the break? 
I have my method when it comes to my work. 
t get offers of her choice after her fourth film, will she again take a break?  
t think that will happen now because at the moment I am getting the kind of work that makes me enthusiastic,?
