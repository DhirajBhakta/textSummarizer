Delhi Congress chief Ajay Maken on Wednesday indicated that his resignation was not accepted as the party high command chose him over former chief minister Sheila Dikshit. 
His statement seems to be a direct attack on former Delhi Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit, who had criticised Maken for 'ignoring' party's senior leaders during the MCD election campaign. 
Also, the former Delhi chief minister's photos were missing from all hoardings of the party during its election campaign.Maken had stepped down following Congress' debacle in MCD polls, taking responsibility of the loss. 
However, the party high command had rejected his resignation and he was asked to continue as party's state unit chief.Maken said he would carry out a reshuffle in the party to strengthen its base in Delhi.
