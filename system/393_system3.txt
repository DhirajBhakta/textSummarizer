Power distribution companies will now have to procure more green energy or electricity generated from renewable sources.The Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission (DERC) has issued a new regulation according to which discoms will either have to generate their own electricity through renewable sources or increase their purchase of green energy from generating companies.The draft rules termed as the DERC (Renewable Purchase Obligation and Renewable Energy Certificate Framework Implementation) Regulations, 2017 will also make it compulsory for discoms to buy 100% electricity being generated from the waste-to-energy (WTE) plants set up in the Capital. 
The distribution licensees shall compulsorily procure 100% power produced from all the Waste-to-Energy plants in the State, in the ratio of their procurement of power from all sources including their own as approved by the Commission from time to time, which shall qualify towards compliance of Renewable Purchase Obligation (RPO) for the Distribution Licensee, read the draft regulations for which comments from public are being sought. 
In 2016-17, the discoms had to get 9% of their total electricity from renewables and in 2015-16 it was 7.6%.However, since 2012, the power regulator had only been carrying it forward to the next financial year as discoms had repeatedly failed to meet the RPOs.As a result, by the year 2015, the defaulting amount has risen up to almost 15 per cent of the total electricity procured by the companies.After defaulting on RPOs for years and with the Aam Aadmi Party government notifying the Delhi Solar Policy, the citys three discoms have now pulled up their socks.
