It was the second major honour of his career, following on from the League Cup triumph in February of that year and Lampard would go on to claim 11 of them  all with his beloved Chelsea, the club he joined from West Ham United in 2001. 
He says the two at Bolton were his best with the one he scored for Chelsea at Aston Villa in 2013, which took him past Bobby Tamblings all-time record for the club, not far behind.When Lampard left Chelsea in 2014 to finish his career at Manchester City and New York City, he did so with 211 goals from 649 appearances for them.
