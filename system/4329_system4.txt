Women's day should be called #MensDay because men celebrate women much more than women celebrate womenWomen on atleast #MensDay should not nag or scream and atleast give some freedom to menOn behalf of all men I hereby wish all the women a Very Happy #MensDayI don't know what men should be doing to women that day but I wish one day in year is celebrated as #MensWomensDayHowever, what obviously takes the crown for being the most Ramu-esque tweet possible is the one he wrote about Sunny Leone.I wish all the women in the world give men as much happiness as Sunny Leone gives"I wish all the women in the world give men as much happiness as Sunny Leone gives," RGV tweeted.What's amazing and really sporting of Sunny Leone is that she did not take offence to Ramu's tweet and replied, well, positively:Soon enough, Twitterati began attacking Ram Gopal Varma for being sexist, misogynist and so on.
