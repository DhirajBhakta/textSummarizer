However, the actor's father, Randhir Kapoor dismissed reports that Lolo is getting married.He told DNA, "I think Lolo is very well settled and happy. 
But I don't think she wants to get married. 
She is a happy mother and if she wants, she can get married any time but there is no step in that direction right now. 
Lolo is an excellent mother who dotes on her children and probably doesn't feel the need to get married."
