Bipasha Basu and Karan Singh Grover are one of the fittest B-Town couples. 
If they love to hit the gym every day, the star couple never fails to inspire their fans with fitness goals. 
And this International Yoga Day, the 'monkey couple' took a detour from their usual fitness regime and turned 'yogi monkeys'. 
Bipasha took to Instagram to share a few pictures performing different asanas with hubby Karan and wrote, "Yoga is like Life - It's a beautiful balance of Holding On and Letting Go.
