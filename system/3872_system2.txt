Farmers from Tamil Nadu ran naked near the Prime Minister's office today, to protest against lack of government assistance in their fight for a drought relief package for a state.The farmers, who have been protesting at Jantar Mantar for 28 days, wanted to drop off their memorandum at the Prime Minister's Office.According to an Indian Express report, a delegation of seven farmers were taken to the PMO and were told that they would meet with Prime Minister Narendra Modi.When they reached there, they found PM Modi was unavailable. 
At one point, the farmers even started rolling on the street naked.The farmer who led the naked protest was eventually arrested. 
Most of these farmers had lost their summer crop too, due to Tamil Nadu's tussle with Kanataka over sharing water from the Cauvery river.The timing of government's demonetisation move didn't help either, as the prevailing cash crunch prevented farmers from tackling their farming expenses. 
Most farmers haven't earned anything to come through on these payments. 
To garner attention, these farmers have resorted to all kinds of methods like cutting themselves and holding dead rats and snakes in their mouth.Late in March some farmers even wore skulls of dead Tamil Nadu farmers, symbolising the fate that awaits them if the centre does not help.Two farmers even attempted suicide at Jantar Mantar.
