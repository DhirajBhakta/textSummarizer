The cop was arrested by the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) for taking money from a woman whose husband was held in connection with drug trafficking. 
The woman was shocked to hear what Charan wanted in return of release of her husband.Apart from Rs 2 lakh, the policeman wanted the woman to sleep with him. 
The woman somehow managed Rs 1 lakh and gave it to Kamaldan Charan. 
When the woman expressed her inability in providing him with the money, the 'predator' cop asked her to 'compromise' if she wanted her man to be free.Charan told the woman that he will come at her house in night to 'enjoy' and spend some time with her. 
The ACB arrested him red handed with the Rs 1 lakh cheque that the woman had given him.
