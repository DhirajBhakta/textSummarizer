The US energy secretary Rick Perry has become the latest victim of a pair of Russian phone pranksters who have previously fooled Elton John into thinking he was chatting to Vladimir Putin.On this occasion, Perry believed he was discussing American coal exports with Ukraines prime minister, Volodymyr Groysman. 
I look forward to visiting with the president and getting a more in-depth briefing  If thats the result, then hes going to be a very, very wealthy and successful man.Krasnov and Stolyarov are sometimes called the Jerky Boys of Russia, named after an American duo who put out recordings of their prank phone calls in the 1990s.
