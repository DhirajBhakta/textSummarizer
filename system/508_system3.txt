He had claimed that he now works as and when he gets an assignment.The family court had accordingly held that since both the parties had failed to produce any documentary evidence of the money that they were making annually, the issue of maintenance would have to be decided upon at a later stage, after examination and cross-examination.In the high court, however, the woman claimed that she wasnt part of any TV shows or films currently and thus, had no money of her own. 
She also told the court that her husband had signed a Telegu movie and thus, made a lot of money. 
He, thus, be directed to pay her some interim maintenance.The husband, meanwhile, told HC that when he and his wife used to stay together, he was the one who paid for all expenses, including the expenses incurred by the petitioners parents, and the money needed to maintain her pet.Taking note of these submissions, the high court held that the mere fact that the petitioner was not part of any TV shows or films currently, did not entitle her to interim maintenance.
