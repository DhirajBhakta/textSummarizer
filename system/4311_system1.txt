WhatsApp may soon bring your good old status. 
The chat app recently killed the old status to launch a new Facebook-like Status tab to its interface. 
The update received mixed reactions from the users with many backlashing the company for removing the old status and turning the app into Facebook. 
?To view or set a status, user has to tap on three dots given at the top right corner of the WhatsApp interface and then go to Settings. 
Set your status just like earlier and same options like Busy, Available and others to choose from.? Also Read:  WhatsApp's beta update finally adds separate buttons for voice and video calls
