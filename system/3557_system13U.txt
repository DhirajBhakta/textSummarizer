The distributors, producers and filmmakers say they want to protect the interest of Pakistani movies as two big films, "Yalghaar" and "Shor Sharaba", along with others in the pipeline, are slated for an Eid release. 
"If Tubelight also releases on Eid, it will certainly hit the business of these Pakistani films and that will not help our industry," actor Mustafa Qureshi said.
