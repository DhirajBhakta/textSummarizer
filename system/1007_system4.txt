While the government claimed more than 36 lakh farmers were eligible for the interim help, less than 3,000 of them have opted for it.With a decision on farm loan waiver pending, the government declared a Rs-10,000 interim loan for farmers for the sowing season. 
Taking note of the poor response, several district central cooperative banks (DCCBs) have published advertisements in newspapers, urging farmers to avail the loan. 
There was a delay in issuing directives to the district banks, but now the Maharashtra State Cooperative Bank has written to all DCCBs, saying it will avail the finances for such loans,? 
The state took 25 days to extend guarantee to the banks for the loan that was announced on June 11.
