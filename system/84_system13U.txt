If you drive a car in Delhi and its suburbs then bad and crowded roads are burning a big hole in your pocket.An ongoing study on how much fuel is wasted because of potholed roads and bad traffic has found that vehicles travelling on average, crowded roads consumed nearly one-and-a-half time more fuel per kilometre compared to good, fuel-efficient roads. 
The figure is expected to rise to three times during the next phase of the study to be conducted on inferior road stretches.The study, commissioned in May, released its preliminary findings last week involving a Sports Utility Vehicle with a mileage of 10 -12 km/litre.
