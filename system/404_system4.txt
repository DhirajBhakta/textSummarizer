You can just sit back and relax now as the registration certificate (RC) for your car will soon be delivered right at your doorstep.Starting next week, the Delhi government is going to put in place a new system in which RCs will be delivered at the vehicle owners? 
showrooms or the Motor Licensing Offices (MLOs) to get the mandatory document that establishes the ownership of a vehicle and ensures that it is part of the count kept by the transport department of a state. 
We were getting feedback that some licensing officers have been engaging in corrupt practices with the car or bike dealers. 
Anyway, it takes several days now to get an RC.
