Despite Afghanistan's strong reservations, Pakistan has started the fencing work along the whole Pakistan-Afghanistan border or Durand Line. 
The border between Afghanistan and Pakistan, known as Durand Line, is disputed and Afghanistan has vowed to never recognise it. 
Afghanistan contends that the validity of the British era document that imposed the Durand Line on Afghanistan expired with the collapse of the British empire from the sub-continent in 1947.Earlier this year, when Pakistan had closed its border with Afghanistan citing terrorists' infiltration, Afghanistan's former president Hamid Karzai had hit back using strong words, "The Government of Pakistan had no legal authority to dictate terms on the Durand line."
