Pictures shared widely on social media showed the owner of the now-defunct Kingfisher Airlines sitting in the stands wearing a white coat. 
Notably, Mallya was once associated with the Indian Premier League as the owner of the Royal Challengers Bangalore team. 
In an another photo, also shared on social media, Mallya was seen along with Indian batting legend Sunil Gavaskar. 
India Today could not independently verify the photo, but the businessman was wearing the same attire seen in other photos shared from the match. 
Gavaskar, who appeared to be looking at something on the liquor baron's phone, and Mallya both could be seen wearing Champions Trophy lanyards. 
Mallya, who owes Indian banks Rs 6,963 crore (Rs 9,000 crore with interest), is wanted in India for cases relating to foreign exchange violation, debt recovery and embezzlement. 
He fled India for the United Kingdom in March last year and was officially declared an absconder by a special Prevention of Money Laundering Act court in November last year. 
The 61-year-old Mallya, known for leading a flamboyant lifestyle, has been fighting an extradition case in the UK. 
In April this year, London's Scotland Yard, acting upon India's request, formally arrested Mallya on an extraction warrant. 
He was taken to a local court, which granted him bail. 
India has been pushing for Mallya's extradition, with even the Prime Minister's Office getting involved.
