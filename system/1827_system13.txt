According to the temple priest, the move was initiated because the amount of donations fell after demonetisation was announced on November 8.When the note ban was announced many people donated old notes. 
Pandey said the number of people holding community feasts has also reduced.Money from community feasts (bhandara) used to be a major source of donations as one such feast would get us between Rs3,000 and Rs5,000.
