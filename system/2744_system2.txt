A day after BJP president Amit Shah addressed a public meeting at the Goa airport complex, a lawyer-activist has filed a complaint against party chief and Manohar Parrikar terming the meet as "gross abuse of power". 
In a very strongly worded letter that India Today is in exclusive possession of, Rodrigues wrote, "It constitutes act of unlawful assembly as defined in section 141 (IPC) by which not only mischief has been caused but also other people who were arriving at or departing from the airport, were restrained by the blockage due to the public meeting".Rodrigues not only demanded that an FIR be registered against the organisers but also all dignitaries including Amit Shah.
