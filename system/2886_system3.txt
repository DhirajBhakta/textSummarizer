This is beautiful, chaotic, madness  I made the film because I wanted to try to bring to England a great poet that they missed. 
I was only trying to amuse, not to harm anyone.During Fridays White House press briefing, Sean Spicer also addressed the comments in reference to a question about the use of a Trump-like lead in a controversial production of Julius Caesar in New York.Look, I think its troubling whether its that [Julius Caesar] or Johnny Depps comments, Spicer told reporters. 
Weve seen this and frankly, as far as Im concerned, I know the president and the first lady have weighed in on Kathy Griffins comments; I dont know if hes aware about the play in particular thats going on there.But it is frankly in my belief a little troubling the lack of outrage that weve seen in some of these instances where people have said what theyve said with respect to the president and the actions that should be taken. 
The presidents made clear that we should denounce violence in all of its forms and I think if were going to hold to that standard we should all agree that that standard should be universally called out.
