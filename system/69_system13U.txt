The Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST) is planning to shift its iconic museum from the Anik Bus Depot at Wadala to Byculla zoo. 
Authorities said bringing the museum to the heart of the city would attract more visitors and rake in some revenue. 
This will also help promote BEST buses, said a BEST official.The museum at the Anik is more than 20 years old, and houses old bus tickets, models of the electric tram, ticket dispensing machines and historical photographs showing of BEST buses over the years.
