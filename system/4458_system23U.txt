Union Minister Uma Bharti on Monday said the BJP made "a huge mistake" by not fielding any Muslim candidate in the ongoing Uttar Pradesh assembly polls."
I am really feeling sorry that we could not field a Muslim. 
I spoke with (BJP President) Amit Shah and (state party President) Keshav Prasad Maurya about how we could have brought a Muslim to the assembly," Uma Bharti told CNN-News18.
