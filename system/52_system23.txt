New Delhi, Aug 2 (PTI) Successive governments have "short changed" Air India by treating it like their private properties, TMC leader Dinesh Trivedi said today as he urged the Centre to review the decision to divest stake in the airline. 
"By just looking at the debt and ignoring the revival signs would be to take a narrow view of the situation," the former railway minister said. 
Against this backdrop, Trivedi said it is evident that there is potential for further growth of Air India if the turnaround plan continues along with other rationalisation measures.
