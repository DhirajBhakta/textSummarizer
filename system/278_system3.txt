Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Mehbooba Mufti warned on Friday that any tinkering with the special rights and privileges of the people of the state will leave no one there to hold the tricolor.The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) chiefs remarks came in the context of the issue of Article 35(A) of the Constitution  that empowers the state legislature to define permanent residents and accord special rights and privileges to them -- being debated in the Supreme Court. 
Their agenda is different and totally secessionist but you are weakening those powers which trust India and participate in elections and fight to live an honourable life in Jammu and Kashmir, she said.Who is doing it Why are they challenging the Article 35(A) I have no doubt in saying that there will be no one to hold national flag if it is tinkered with, the CM said.The basic question is how much is the idea of India ready to accommodate the idea of Kashmir This is the basic crux.
