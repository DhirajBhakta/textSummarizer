I am not dating her yaar. 
The two are set to reunite onscreen in the upcoming film Makhna.Apparently, on Taapsee's birthday last year, Saqib took her out and planned an elaborate surprise for her. 
But Saqib insisted that a mountain was being made of a molehill.When reality is better than fiction! 
She has an amazing sense of humour, and I love spending time with her. 
But, we are not dating each other, except on-screen for our next film."
Incidentally, Taapsee had confirmed to IndiaToday.in earlier this year that she was in a relationship. 
Without naming the man in her life, she had said, "I'm extremely proud of my relationship status and the person I'm with."
