and God : HC New Delhi, Feb 10 (PTI) Priests ought not to obstruct communication between devotees and God, the Delhi High Court today said while giving suggestions on managing the rush of people at Kalkaji Temple here. 
The observation came from Justice J R Midha who also said that the "working in the temple has to improve. 
I am concerned whether a temple should be run in this way". 
Give a person one or two seconds to communicate with God. 
The people there (the priests) are not better enlightened that they can communicate to God better than devotees," the judge said.
