New Delhi, Jun 5 (PTI) Changing an over 50-year-old rule, the government has set a deadline of six months to complete probe in corruption cases involving its employees. 
The Inquiring Authority should conclude the inquiry and submit its report within a period of six months, says the amended rules. 
The disciplinary authority shall deliver to a government servant, accused of irregularity and corruption, a copy of the articles of charge, the statement of the imputations of misconduct or misbehaviour and a list of documents and witnesses by which each article or charges is proposed to be sustained, the new rules said. 
The time-limit can, however, be extended for a period not exceeding fifteen days. 
The Central Vigilance Commission (CVC), in a directive, had last year expressed serious concern over delay in finalising corruption cases and asked all departments to complete these inquiries within a maximum period of six months to keep away "nothing will change" notion associated with governance.
