Washington, Mar 27 (PTI) A 38-year-old woman in the US, who was apprehended twice for allegedly trying to jump the White House fence last week, has been arrested for scaling a fence at the Treasury Building. 
Police said Wahl has told them she was there to speak to US President Donald Trump, the CNN reported. 
She was charged with unlawful entry and contempt of court. 
Once in custody, it was determined that Wahl had been issued a "stay away" order for the White House complex after the incident. 
Officers found her hanging from the inside of the fence by her shoelaces, which were "caught on top of the fence," according to a police report. 
She was released on her own recognisance after a Saturday court appearance. 
In the incident, Wahl was charged with contempt of court in violation of a stay away order. 
She pleaded not guilty last Saturday and was again released on her own recognisance.
