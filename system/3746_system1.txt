New Delhi, Apr 18 (PTI) The government is assessing how to bring Vijay Mallya back to India and start judicial proceedings against him, Union Minister Santosh Gangwar said today on a day when the defaulter businessman was arrested in London and released later on bail. 
"We will not take any such step which could make it appear that we are going against law, and we will not leave any offender who falls under Indian law," Gangwar pointed out.
