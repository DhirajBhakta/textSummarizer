Investors, today, will think thoroughly before investing their money as the courts have now taken cognizance of the gravity of such crimes and have began taking stern decisions to avoid similar frauds.The Karnataka High Court today refused to give the passport of the promoters of S Kumar's a company owned by Nitin Shambhu Kumar Kasliwal. 
Promoter Kasliwal had borrowed an amount close to Rs 6,500 crore from various banks.The banks that have sought recovery from Kasliwal include Punjab National Bank, UCO Bank, Union Bank of India, Central Bank, Jammu Kashmir Bank, Indian Bank and IDBI Bank.Kasliwal appealed before the court to travel abroad, however, it seems the Mallya incident have influenced the decision making of the court which refused to handover the passport.Kasliwal was declared a wilful defaulter by UCO bank and in December 2016, the Debts Recovery Tribunal had seized his passport after the notification.The fear expressed by the prosecution was that of they let him to travel abroad, Kasliwal may escape like Mallya did and they will not be able to recover their debts.According to the advocate representing the banks, Kasliwal owes Rs 6,494 crore as in July 2015.NO RIGHT TO IMPOUND KASLIWALKasliwal's advocate argued in court saying that the DRT had no right to impound the passport and that Kasliwal was allowed to travel abroad earlier too.
