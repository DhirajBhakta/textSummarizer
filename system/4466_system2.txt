New Delhi, Feb 26 (PTI) Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar will address two rallies in the national capital ahead of the municipal polls, where JD(U) will contest all the 272 seats, taking on the AAP on its home turf. 
Jha brushed aside Kumars perceived closeness with Kejriwal, saying JD(U) will work for expanding its base and work towards ensuring "fair" representation of the Poorvanchali population.
