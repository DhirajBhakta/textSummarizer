Up to 76 people were rescued from cable cars suspended over the river Rhine in Cologne on Sunday afternoon after a gondola crashed into a support pillar, leaving passengers stranded. 
German media reported that rescue teams in Cologne had practised for an incident on the gondola just a week ago.A pregnant woman and a man were slightly injured in the rescue mission in which mobile cranes were used to bring the stranded passengers to safety. 
Martina and Hans-Peter Rieger, the first to be rescued, were celebrating their 41st wedding anniversary on a day out in Cologne when the cable cars stopped. 
Fortunately, we were given hand signals to tell us we should remain calm and the incident was nothing bad.Emergency services from Aachen and Dusseldorf assisted fire crews with the rescue.  
Henriette Reker, the mayor of Cologne, said: I would like to thank the Cologne fire brigade for their great dedication.
