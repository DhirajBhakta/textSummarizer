London, Jul 9 (PTI) Four paintings created by the German dictator Adolf Hitler, have been sold for a total of 7,500 pounds - much lower than the estimated price - at an auction in the UK. 
The works of art all bear the signature A Hitler, and are dated in the early 1900s, according to the Mullocks auction house in the UK. 
The paintings had been expected to fetch between 5,000 and 7,000 pounds each. 
The paintings were sold for 1,600, 1,500, 2,400 and 2,000 pounds respectively. 
An unsigned painting, that shows the grave of Hilters half-niece Geli Raubel and is widely thought to have been made by the Nazi leader, remained unsold.
