Hyderabad, Mar 5 (PTI) Academy Award-winning composer AR Rahman never realised that he was born for music and it was his mother who predicted that he would be a music composer. 
The music director said his mother made a choice and motivated him to make a career in music. 
"I never knew that I was born for music. 
The day I realized that music would be my passion and future was when I went to my studio that had no equipment. 
I felt one day I will have all types of equipment all over this place that I cant afford now."
