Over a hundred legislators were estimated to have cross-voted in valid votes.Those involved in the counting of votes on July 20 told HT that invalid ones were due to dots, inverted commas, circles and slants that electors erroneously used on their ballot papers. 
The BJP got one vote invalidated because the 1 was slanted by about 30 to 40 degrees and not perpendicular; the Congress got the same opportunity later. 
According to Anoop Mishra, secretary general of the Lok Sabha and the Returning Officer for the presidential poll, any of these can lead a vote invalid: Writing the same preference number outside both candidates names, putting a tick mark, or writing outside the box. 
These can even be a dot, a line or even a wrong-coloured ink, he told HT.Deepender Singh Hooda, counting agent for Meira Kumar, maintained that broadly, votes for both sides got cancelled due to errors, but the BJP seemed better prepared. 
Senior BJP leader Bhupendra Yadav, counting agent for Kovind, said that a day before the poling, his party had made a presentation to its legislators on voting rules.Its possible that some members themselves might have got their votes rejected, but there could also be inadvertent errors.
