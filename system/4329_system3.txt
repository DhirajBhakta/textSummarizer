Ram Gopal Varma, filmmaker and enfant terrible on Twitter, once again did what he does best.The Sarkar 3 director took to Twitter to make a series of tweets regarding Women's Day which happens to be today, March 8.And so it began...Is there no #MensDay because all days in the year belong to only men and the women were given just only one dayWomen's day should be called #MensDay because men celebrate women much more than women celebrate womenWomen on atleast #MensDay should not nag or scream and atleast give some freedom to menOn behalf of all men I hereby wish all the women a Very Happy #MensDayI don't know what men should be doing to women that day but I wish one day in year is celebrated as #MensWomensDayHowever, what obviously takes the crown for being the most Ramu-esque tweet possible is the one he wrote about Sunny Leone.I wish all the women in the world give men as much happiness as Sunny Leone gives"I wish all the women in the world give men as much happiness as Sunny Leone gives," RGV tweeted.What's amazing and really sporting of Sunny Leone is that she did not take offence to Ramu's tweet and replied, well, positively:Soon enough, Twitterati began attacking Ram Gopal Varma for being sexist, misogynist and so on. 
However, RGV was quick to respond saying that such attacks are only hypocritical.The negative noise towards my tweet on @SunnyLeone arises from ultimate hypocrisy.She has more honesty and more self respect than any womanI appreciate ur honesty in accepting @SunnyLeone gets more attention than all the other women combined ? https://t.co/RTUxux1RbmAfter this, RGV spoke about making a short film that would expose the "sanctimoniousness of extremely antithetical multifarious perspectives on the phenomenon of Sunny Leone."
Soon making short film on exposing sanctimoniousness of extremely antithetical multifarious perspectives on the phenomenon of @SunnyLeoneMy short film on her phenomenon will bare the veiled centrally decomposed cogitations in all the mentally corroded naysayers of @SunnyLeoneAll u illiterates who dint understand my earlier 2 tweets on @SunnyLeone atleast go through dictionary unless u are uneducated for that tooAway from the hungama on Twitter, Ram Gopal Varma will soon have to flex his directorial muscles on the big screen with Sarkar 3. 
Starring Amitabh Bachchan, Manoj Bajpayee, Jackie Shroff, Amit Sadh and Yami Gautam, Sarkar 3 releases in theatres on April 7.Sunny Leone meanwhile will be seen making special appearences in Noor and Baadshaho, both slated to release this year.
