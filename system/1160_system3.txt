s comrades freedom fighters or army deserters: CIC.
New Delhi, Feb 14 (PTI) Were Indian National Army soldiers who sided with revolutionary leader Subhas Chandra Bose freedom fighters or army deserters? 
The Central Information Commission has ordered the Home Ministry to answer this question. 
The case came up for hearing before Information Commissioner Sridhar Acharyulu as Right to Information applicant Prodyot Kumar Mitra could not get details on the status of INA soldiers who had marched with Bose. 
His application filed on August 26, 2014 was first transferred to CPIO, Ministry of Defence which was further transferred to Department of Ex-Serviceman Welfare and finally to Ministry of Home Affairs. 
Four months after Mitra filed the application, National Archives offered inspection of records and asked him to cull out desired information and documents. 
Acharyulu noted that the Home Ministry was right in transferring the RTI application to the National Archives as far as records are concerned.
