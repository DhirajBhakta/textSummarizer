New Delhi, Jul 26 (PTI) The railway ministry today cancelled a caterers contract after a passenger found a dead lizard in his vegetable biryani served on a Delhi-bound train from Howrah, a ministry spokesperson said. 
The passenger had ordered and eaten the dish without noticing the lizard but felt unwell later, a co-passenger, Meghna Sinha, said in a series of Tweets yesterday. 
The ministry tweeted today that the catering contract on Poorva Express was given to R K Associates on May 15, 2014, for five years. 
The caterer was fined Rs 10 lakh last year and Rs 7.5 lakh, it said in another Tweet. 
The passenger, who had asked for the biryani when the train was near Jhajha, Bihar, also uploaded a complaint on Twitter. 
The spokesperson said in the last six months, the administration had terminated the contracts of eight catering units.
