Police said that the theft was foiled by two constables who spotted the men while on patrolling. 
While they were taking the cash tray out, two policemen on patrolling duty crossed the ATM and saw the men breaking the ATM open. 
The policemen, however, chased the two men who were inside the ATM, but they managed to escape. 
The police have registered a case against the men and have started to conduct raids to arrest them.
