Washington, May 7 (PTI) Noise pollution caused by humans is pervasive in the US protected areas, posing a threat to land masses that harbour wildlife and provide places for respite, recreation, and natural resource conservation. 
The results summarised predictions of existing sound levels, estimates of natural sound levels, and the amount that human-made noise raises levels above natural levels, which is considered noise pollution. 
Researchers found that human-made noise doubled background sound levels in 63 per cent of US protected areas, and caused a ten-fold or greater increase in background levels in 21 per cent of protected areas. 
In other words, noise reduced the area that natural sounds can be heard by 50 to 90 per cent.
