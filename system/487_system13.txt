Here is the entire text of the poem: We are the mob and the mob is us.Left-wing, right-wing or in the centre, what difference does it makeArent we all just looking for a fight, since were always right & the other fakeNot thoughts or feelings, but trending hashtags tell us where to draw daggers, and how deep.And before we hit the jugular, we are wowed  by another trend, another bend, and we unflinchingly take the leap.Dog thrown from a roof, child fallen in a well,Valentine villains volley, kittens rescued from hell.Perverted politicians exposed, potholes all the way, #SelfieWithMamma is trending; smile, its mothers day.Then theres #climatechange #harassment  #feminism and #gayrights.Like bloodhounds we wait on standby, For an invisible god to trend the next fight.140 character zombies, will then rise on two sides.Each will uphold an idea of truth thats either black or it is white.Their truth is the truth, They have no time for nuance.Craven web-warriors will turn lynch mobs,dancing in a deathly digital trance.Slam, demolish, destroy; headlines appear to provoke outrage.Hypnotised by clever click-bait, we are programmed to spew hate.Often, a stray opinion will wander,into this curfew of manufactured truth,seeking no alliance with black nor white,and with original thought to boot.But contradictions will be silenced, and trolled with damning labels.
