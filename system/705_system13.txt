The BJP got one vote invalidated because the 1 was slanted by about 30 to 40 degrees and not perpendicular; the Congress got the same opportunity later. 
Senior BJP leader Bhupendra Yadav, counting agent for Kovind, said that a day before the poling, his party had made a presentation to its legislators on voting rules.Its possible that some members themselves might have got their votes rejected, but there could also be inadvertent errors.
