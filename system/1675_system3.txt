This year, we have the slightly safer option of Jimmy Fallon but hes already promised Trump jokes and, lets face it, he owes us an electoral college worth of them after he televised the pairs sleepover last year.Its also a promising crop up for awards this year, a slightly fresher pack than usual with La La Land, Moonlight and Manchester by the Sea leading the film side and The Crown, The Night Manager and The People vs OJ Simpson making a strong showing.But who will win Who will lose Who will mispronounce a nominees name and go viral Well be here with you all damn night providing answers and probably some yawns too.
