s show would replace The Kapil Sharma Show, but they turned out to be false. 
Krushna says he made a conscious decision to take up this show. 
I wanted to do something new and different, and this new show will be unlike my earlier show, Comedy Nights Bachao, and even Kapil?
There is no competition with Kapil, but now that Ali and others are in my show, people will link it to Kapil again, saying they left him to join me. 
Both of us will try to give our best to our shows, and we will give tough competition to Kapil.
