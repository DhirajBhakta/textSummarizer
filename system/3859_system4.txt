Peshawar, Apr 9 (PTI) Pakistan is planning to sell donkeys to China after an investment of Rs 1 billion in its Donkey Development Programme, in a bid to attract Chinese investors in the northwestern Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province. 
The Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa-China Sustainable Donkey Development Programme worth Rs 1 billion (USD 9.5 million) is one of the many investment portfolios prepared by the province to attract Chinese investment in its agriculture sector under the ambitious USD 46 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, the Express Tribune reported.
