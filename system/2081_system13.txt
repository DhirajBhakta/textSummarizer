The campaign aimed to harness Wonder Womans popularity to allow the UN to target new audiences with its messages on equality for women and girls.The angry response in some quarters prompted the UN to make celebrating the achievements of real-life Wonder Women one of the campaigns core goals.The collaboration had lasted longer than previous UN roles given to fictional characters, Brez added, pointing out that a character from the video game Angry Birds served as climate change ambassador for a single day in March.Other fictional characters to have been given honorary roles include Winnie the Pooh as honorary ambassador for friendship in 1997, and Tinkerbell as honorary ambassador for green to promote environmental awareness in 2009.Warner Bros and DC Entertainment have been extremely pleased with the partnerships role in raising awareness of the empowerment of women and girls, a spokeswoman said.Wonder Woman stands for peace, justice and equality, and for 75 years she has been a motivating force for many and will continue to be long after the conclusion of her UN honorary ambassadorship.
