This will send a message to the token vendor or the customer care operator, who will then issue the token or recharge the card with the desired amount, Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) said in a statement.The 10 metro stations which have been chosen, are done so because of certain prominent factors, namely, major footfall of smart-card holders there (at least 70%) and adequate mobile connectivity.They are Rohini East and Rohini West on the Red Line; MG Road Station on Yellow Line; Mayur Vihar Phase-I, Nirman Vihar, Tilak Nagar, Janakpuri West, and Noida Sector-15 on Blue Line; and Nehru Place and Kailash Colony on the Violet Line.
