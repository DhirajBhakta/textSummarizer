Citing Pakistan's decision to sentence Kulbhushan Jadhav to death, Thackeray's Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) workers on Tuesday stormed into fashion brand Zara's showroom in Lower Parel and threw away clothes bearing Made in Pakistan tags. 
The party says this is their way to protest against the decision of a Pakistani court to sentence Indian citizen Kulbhushan Jadhav to death."
