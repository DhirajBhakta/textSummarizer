To their shock, when they returned, they found BhakyaSri's dead body in a freezer box kept at the doorstep. 
To add to their plight, the parents had to face blatant apathy at the Coimbatore General Hospital, where they were asked to pay Rs 3,000 as bribe to collect BhakyaSri's body from the morgue. 
BhakyaSri's relatives claim that Naveen Balaji who runs the herbal treatment centre in Erode is a fraud and has no authorisation from medical bodies or the government.
