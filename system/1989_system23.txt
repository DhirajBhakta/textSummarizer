The agency said the IAS officer abused his official position by favouring a particular firm while awarding tenders.Besides Kumar, the agency has named eight others and a company in the chargesheet.The CBI had arrested Kumar in the case but later he was released on bail.The CBIs searches at the office of Kumar in December 2015 and later his arrest led to a war of words between the Aam Aadmi Party government in Delhi and the BJP-ruled Centre.After the raids at Kumars offices in December 2015, Kejriwal directly targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi.The CBIs initiated its probe in the case after a complaint filed by former Delhi Dialogue Commission member, Ashish Joshi.At the time of his arrest, the AAP government had said the CBI was conducting the probe at the Centres behest.The Centre is targeting him (Kumar) only because of Kejriwal and the tremendous support the AAP is getting in Punjab and Goa, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia had said at the time of Kumars arrest.
