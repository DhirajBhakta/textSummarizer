Who will bear the financial burden questioned Prem Singh, leader of Mumbai Taxi Association. 
Last week, Ranjit Patil, Minister of State for Home, said in the legislative assembly that conventional auto rickshaws and taxis will have to install GPS systems on the lines of app-based aggregators such as Ola and Uber, considering the safety of the passengers. 
The unions, however, claimed that they had brought their own taxi booking app, through which most of their taxis could be tracked.There has not been a molestation in black and yellow taxis and therefore it is one of the safest transport modes for women, said AL Quadros, leader of Mumbai Taximens Union.
