Delhi Metro stations are soon going to have giant digital walls to play video advertisements minus the audio. 
Digital walls will give us the chance to bring in multiple advertisers at the same time and in the same space, a metro official said.Moreover, it is also a lot easier to manage. 
Once these walls are installed, only a pen drive will be needed to put ads and information. 
Earlier, putting up an ad took one to two days, the official said.Read: No Metro fare hike for at least three more monthsAround 10 ad walls of 12x6 feet have been installed at the ITO station. 
But the size of these walls is going to get bigger at busy stations like Rajiv Chowk, Kashmere Gate, Central Secretariat and New Delhi. 
The walls at these hubs will be as big as 16x8 feet.Similar pattern will also be followed in the upcoming stations under the Phase 3 network.
