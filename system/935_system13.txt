The judges at the Yeovil show had crowned the two hefty blocks of cheese champion and reserve champion and the specimens were being left in a marquee overnight so that they could be admired by members of the public next day. 
Thieves took the blocks, weighing 20kg each and with a retail value of around ?800, and the winners certificates from the tent during overnight on Saturday. 
They left all the other cheeses and just took ours, he said.
