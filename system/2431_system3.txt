During her recent interview with HTBrunch, Pooja Bhatt revealed that after making sensitive movies like Zakhm and Tamanna, she ventured into adult content with Jism because those kind of movies have a mass appeal.?
Then I made Zakhm, again a sensitive movie based on my father?
The business of Jism is more than the collective business off Zakhm, Tamanna, Dushman, Sur all put together.?
One that you make to jolt the audience and the other is the kind you make to soothe the jolted. 
And there is the elite intellectual audience who goes to the cinemas in the fine saris and gold and they want to see the other side - the darker side that has poverty and diseases.
