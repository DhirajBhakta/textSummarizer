During her recent interview with HTBrunch, Pooja Bhatt revealed that after making sensitive movies like Zakhm and Tamanna, she ventured into adult content with Jism because those kind of movies have a mass appeal.My first production was Tamanna. 
The age that Alia is today, I had made a film on female infanticide. 
Then I made Zakhm, again a sensitive movie based on my fathers real life story, was a box office disaster. 
It is people who made Jism run to packed houses. 
I am not interested in making movies that only 10 people will watch and will get critical appreciation at some festival.Also, Jism is a film she stands by.
