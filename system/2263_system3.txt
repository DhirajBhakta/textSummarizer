Lewis Hamilton won his home British Grand Prix for the fourth year in a row on Sunday while a penultimate-lap puncture slashed Sebastian Vettel's championship lead to a single point.The Briton's drive from pole to flag on an overcast afternoon was lonely, uneventful and dominant -- in complete contrast to his Ferrari rival's afternoon -- with Mercedes team mate Valtteri Bottas finishing 14 seconds behind to secure the one-two."
The support has been incredible this weekend. 
I am so proud I could do this for you all," said Hamilton, who threw himself into the fans for some 'crowd surfing' after the podium celebrations."
The team were faultless this weekend, Valtteri did an incredible job as well so it's the perfect weekend for us."

There was no sign of that happening," said Vettel over the team radio. 
The tyres didn't look great but they never look great."
