The Supreme Court on Thursday rejected a petition seeking a stay on release of director Madhur Bhandarkars next, Indu Sarkar. 
Dismissing the petition, a bench of justices including, Dipak Misra, Amitav Roy and AM Khanwilkar, said the movie is an artistic expression within the parameters of law.The movie, which releases on Friday, deals with the controversial subject of Emergency imposed in 1975 by former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. 
The petition filed by Priya Singh Paul, who cliams to be the daughter of Sanjay Gandhi, alleges the movie is full of concocted facts and is totally derogatory.On July 24, the Bombay High Court had dismissed the petition saying no known descendant of Sanjay Gandhi has objected to the movie.The Court said that the petitioner had not made out any case for the court to interfere and stay the release of the movie after the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) granted certificate to the film.Priya, in her petition, has claimed that Sanjay Gandhi was her biological father and the movie points fingers at him. 
Sanjay Gandhis widow, Maneka Gandhi, and their son, Varun, are BJP leaders and they have not commented on the issue.
