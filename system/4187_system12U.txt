London, Mar 18 (PTI) A five-legged lamb has been born at a farm in the UK and named after a Tom Hanks character. 
The Bayley family nicknamed the young male Forrest in the hope his extra limb gives him the same love of running as film character Forrest Gump. 
Bayley said although it was tempting to sell Forrest for meat, he would probably be kept as a family pet, the BBC reported.
