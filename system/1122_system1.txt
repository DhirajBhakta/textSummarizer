A flight that has adequate fuel to fly, passengers are ready and pilots eager to move on. 
Yet it cannot take-off. 
Have you ever heard of such cases? 
They are experiencing the bitter circumstance every minute.AI 130 flew from London for Mumbai but enroute encountered with a case of medical emergency on board. 
The pilot had to contact the nearest Air Traffic Control to make an emergency landing at Ankara.But, later a technical issue prevented it from taking off and flying to its destination.The plane is a Boeing 787. 
And, since it was Boeing 787, it cannot take-off if it has made 'overweight landing'.
