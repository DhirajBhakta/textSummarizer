#pune activity cancelled. pic.twitter.com/6GHX1VHGD8 Madhur Bhandarkar (@imbhandarkar) July 15, 2017Its baffling to see self proclaimed custodians of #freedomOfExpression creating huge ruckus to prevent a legitimate release of #InduSarkar pic.twitter.com/orJVVJULdp Madhur Bhandarkar (@imbhandarkar) July 15, 2017Earlier, Bhandarkar had censured the controversy surrounding his upcoming directorial venture and had asserted that the movie is not a documentary, but a work of fiction.This is completely wrong, and controversy like this should not happen because I made a film as a filmmaker and Im saying that 70 percent of film is fiction and 30 percent is reality. 
:The trailer of the film says its a film on Emergency and hence, we can see the likes of our beloved leaders like Indira Gandhi ji, Sanjay Gandhi ji and other senior leaders of the India National Congress.
