s unfortunately the environment that we are in at this point of time that most filmmakers are self-censoring when it comes to subjects that they pick to make a movie about because they are concerned about how it will finally be received when it goes to the CBFC for clearance. 
I believe that the (government-appointed) Shyam Benegal Committee has made some very good recommendations on what should be done as far as the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) is concerned. 
s about the industry figuring out an economic model that makes sense to everyone in the value chain rather than for a few people. 
s budget, but breaking away from the strongly-rooted star system is going to be no answer either, said Kapur. ?
