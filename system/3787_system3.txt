Taking cognisance of the increasing menace of drug and substance abuse among children in the NCR region, the Juvenile Justice Board has banned the sale of correction fluids/ whiteners, thinners/diluters and vulcanised solutions/sulochans to children below the age of 18 years unless the child is accompanied by parents/guardian, or has a letter from the school authorities signifying their assent to purchase of the same.The government of Delhi has been asked to issue a notification to this effect. 
The Juvenile Justice Board has further asked the Directorate of Health in Delhi to work out a plan to open more de-addiction centres as there is a severe crunch at this moment.According to a report by Department of Women and Child Development, Government of NCT as of September 2016, around 19,320 to 27,090 street children were afflicted by this malaise.
