Air India, the Maharaja airlines that is sandwiched between heavy debts and highly dissatisfied passengers, decided to take non-vegetarian meal off domestic flights. 
Air India that masquerades the decision as a cost-cutting exercise, however, does not answer why only the economy class flyers are being denied non-vegetarian meals while the business class passengers on the same flight have the option open. 
Six months ago, Air India had struck down non-vegetarian meals on domestic flights, again just for economy class flyers, with a flight duration less than 90 minutes.? As people on social media called the Maharaja out on the decision that reeks of class bias, fellow airline Vistara took a dig at Air India on Twitter saying they leave the choice of food to the flyers.
