England pace spearhead James Anderson, who is one of the senior members of the national team, has admitted he was a bit disappointed after he was overlooked for the role of Test captain following Alastair Cook's decision to step down from the post.Cook had earlier this year stepped down as England's Test captain after a record 59 matches in charge. 
I'm all for bowlers being captains," he said.Anderson's arguments can be backed up seeing the examples of Shaun Pollock, Courtney Walsh, Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis who have successfully led their sides in all the formats of the game.The 34-year-old will play for Lancashire in the County Championship, in a bid to get match fit after sustaining a shoulder injury during England's tour of India last year.
