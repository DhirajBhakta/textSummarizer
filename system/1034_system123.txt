Ward number 220 of Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has perhaps turned out to be the most keenly contested seat between BJP and Shiv Sena anywhere in Maharashtra in the just-concluded civic elections. 
Atul Shah, the BJP candidate, was a former MLA contesting against Shiv Sena's Surendra Bagalkar. 
So it came as a shock that the MLA had lost the municipal corporation election.? After the counting was over, the Sena's Bagalkar was declared the winner.
