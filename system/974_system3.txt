Two monkeys strayed into the swanky, multi-storeyed headquarters building of the civic bodies on Monday, triggering panic and chaos for a while among the staff and security personnel.The 28-storey complex, built about a decade ago and spread over several blocks  Civic Centre  houses the headquarters of BJP-led North Delhi Municipal Corporation (NDMC) and South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC).Leader of Congress in NDMC Mukesh Goel alleged negligence in security and held the authorities of the corporation responsible for the incident. 
They were shooed away as soon as possible.Goel also brought to notice an old incident when a former deputy mayor of the then unified corporation had died after being attacked by a monkey.The incident did not take place at the Civic Centre, but at his home when a monkey had attacked him and in the process he slipped off his balcony and suffered a fall that proved fatal, the civic official said.If civic authorities cant keep the headquarters free from stray monkeys and dogs, how will they ensure the same in other areas, Goel asked.The unified Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) was trifurcated in 2012 into NDMC, SDMC and EDMC.
