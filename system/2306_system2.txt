The Rajya Sabha member from West Bengal representing the Trinamool Congress, Derek O'Brien thought to have "little bit of fun" on Instagram.The fun came soon after the Mumbai Police Cyber Cell registered an FIR against comedy group AIB co-founder, Tanmay Bhat.

A post shared by Derek O'Brien (@quizderek) on Jul 14, 2017 at 9:44pm PDTIt seems it wasn't Derek's idea to use the dog filter. 
OML Founder CEO Vijay Nair tweeted on July 14 saying 'he'd vote for any politician who uploads their photo with a dog filter'.Any politician who would voluntarily upload their pic with a dog filter right now gets my vote.On July 15, Derek O'Brien along with Shashi Tharoor was tagged in a tweet.
