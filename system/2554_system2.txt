a bench headed by Justice Ranjan Gogoi asked the EC counsel whose submission was a departure from the stand the commission took in its affidavit.In response to a public interest litigation raising the demand, the EC had on April filed an affidavit where it supported the petitioner?
The short affidavit said the commission supported the cause of the petitioner to decriminalise politics. 
In its affidavit in April it had said that the court should not pass orders on the issue as this is a matter best decided by the Parliament.The court also took a swipe at the petitioner for invoking Article 14 (right to equality) in the case.
