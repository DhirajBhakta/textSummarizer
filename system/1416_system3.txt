When Kim Jong-un first came to power, I was hopeful that he would make reasonable and rational decisions to save North Korea from poverty, but I soon fell into despair watching him purging officials for no proper reasons, Thae said during his first news conference with foreign media on Wednesday.Low-level dissent or criticism of the regime, until recently unthinkable, is becoming more frequent, said Thae, who spoke in fluent, British-accented English. 
Thae is the most senior official to have fled North Korea and entered public life in the south since the 1997 defection of Hwang Jang-yop, the brains behind the Norths governing ideology, Juche, which combines Marxism and extreme nationalism. 
Thae has said more North Korean diplomats are waiting in Europe to defect to South Korea.
