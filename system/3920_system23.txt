New York, Apr 6 (PTI) A hybrid electric aircraft startup founded by an Indian-origin entrepreneur has received investments from aerospace giants -- Boeing and JetBlue owing to its goal to develop alternative propulsion aircraft. 
"As a company that is also deeply committed to innovation in sustainable travel, we believe that Zunum and its quiet, environmentally friendly aircraft will light up a vast network of underutilised airports and reinvent regional travel," JetBlue said.
