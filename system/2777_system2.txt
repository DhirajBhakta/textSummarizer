Berlin, Jun 30 (PTI) Scientists have developed magnetic microbots with silver nanoparticles that can zoom around contaminated water and clean up disease-causing bacteria. 
Drinking water contaminated with pathogenic bacteria can cause serious illnesses that, in areas with spotty medical services, are potentially life-threatening without proper treatment. 
Water can be disinfected with chlorine or other disinfectants, but there are some hardy bacteria and other microorganisms that are hard to remove. 
In recent years, researchers have been exploring the use of self-propelled micromotors to degrade and capture pollutants in water. 
One face is made with magnesium, which reacts with water to produce hydrogen bubbles to propel the microbots.
