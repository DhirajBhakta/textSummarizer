The Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority is planning to extend the WadalaGhatkoparThaneKasarvadavali Metro 4 up to GPO at Fort in south Mumbai. 
MbPT has conveyed to the MMRDA that it would like an underground line, but the final decision will be taken once the report is out, said a senior official.Officials added MbPT will share the project cost as the extension would help them get footfalls when port trust land is developed commercially.
