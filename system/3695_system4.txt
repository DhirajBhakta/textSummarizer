The decision was taken at a high-level security review meeting chaired by Amarinder and attended by Punjab Director General of Police (DGP) Suresh Arora and Additional Director General of Police (Intelligence) Dinkar Gupta, besides Chief Principal Secretary Suresh Kumar. 
The chief minister has already ordered withdrawal of all deployment along his travel routes and his security is likely to be cut down further at the next review meeting, based on fresh reports on threat perceptions. 
With the existing security policy being three-year-old, he directed the police to call for fresh reports from the state and central agencies to map the threat perceptions of individuals who have been provided security and then decide on the quantum of security.
