If you ask me, obviously Im the kind of guy who just wants to wrap his sister in a blanket, because I am an over-protective brother, says Tiger. 
Tiger recently faced flak for calling his female co-stars padding, but he later clarified that the word was used for anything outside his own zone in a film project, and that he wasnt referring to the female leads specifically.Given how protective he is, we ask why Tiger didnt fire at those who trolled Krishna for posting her topless photos on Instagram  the photos, in fact, only showed her bare back  even though his father, actor Jackie Shroff, was vocal about the matter.
