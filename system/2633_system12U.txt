On the occasion of Guru Purnima today, the students fondly recalled the contribution of their mentor Ramakant Achrekar who they call Achrekar Sir. 
In my opinion, sir was a Guru and there is a lot of difference between a Guru and a coach," said Amre, who played 11 Tests for the country. 
Former India stumper and batsman Chandrakant Pandit recalled how "visionary" Achrekar sir made him change his school to pursue a career in cricket.
