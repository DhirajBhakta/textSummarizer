Jessica Ennis-Hill will finally get her hands on the 2011 world championships gold medal originally denied her by the Russian drugs cheat Tatyana Chernova at a special ceremony at next months world championships in London. 
It means Ennis-Hill becomes a three-times world heptathlon champion, to go along with her Olympic gold and silver medals.The Guardian has also learned that the number of medallists who will be re-allocated medals at London 2017 will be significantly increased to include non-British athletes, with discussions taking place about when to hold the special ceremonies. 
It just adds credence to my belief that she is the best female athlete Britain has ever produced.Minichiello also welcomed the news that international athletes, too, cheated out of medals by drugs cheats would be rewarded.
