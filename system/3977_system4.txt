This move came after a private financial institution YT Capital Pvt Ltd petitioned the Bombay High Court against the film's producer Anjum Rizvi and has also made T-series, the film's co-producer, a party.While hearing the petition on Thursday, Justice Gautam Patel of the Bombay High Court noted that YT Capital Pvt Ltd had obtained an order in their favour against the film producers in an earlier petition where an amount of Rs 2,44,71,718 was due from Rizvi and had not been paid to the company. 
The court noted that "an Agreement for co-production dated 22nd September 2014 made it clear that the Decree Holder (YT Capital) would not only have a lien on the previous films but all future feature films or television serials of Rizvi and that these would not be released or distributed till the debt was paid."
