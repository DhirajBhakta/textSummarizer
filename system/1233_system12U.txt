London, Feb 9 (PTI) Scientists may have analysed almost 5,000 orangutan "kiss squeaks" - purse-lipped consonant-like calls that appear to convey different messages to understand how human ancestors formed their earliest words. 
Researchers from Durham University in UK spent years listening to the communication calls of one of our closest ape relatives. 
The scientists recorded and analysed 4,486 kiss-squeaks recorded from 48 animals in four wild populations.
