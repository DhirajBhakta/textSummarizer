The debris on either side of the river Yamuna, if not already removed, shall be removed within three weeks,? 
the bench said.

inaction on part of authorities cannot be tolerated?.?
In the interest of environment and public health, the government and all authorities concerned must perform their function and ensure that the Yamuna is rejuvenated to its original pristine status.
