The Whatsapp helpline 9910641064 launched in 2014 was started by the vigilance department to take complaints of police personnel in corruption and wrong doing. 
Senior police officers, however, claimed that complaints of corruption, extortion, connivance with criminals and unlawful activities and misbehaviour decreased in 2016 when compared with 2015.  
The sharp decline in complaints received against police personnel is a result of the sustained emphasis laid by us and prompt inquiry into complaints followed by swift punitive action on substantiated allegations.
