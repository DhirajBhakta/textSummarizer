By Laxmi Devi Bengaluru, Apr 14 (PTI) President Pranab Mukherjee today underscored the need for India to be a global powerhouse not just in terms of economic parameters but also Gross National Happiness. 
"If we aspire to be one of the leading economic powers of the world, yes, we can be, but merely in statistical terms, in terms of gross domestic product (GDP), in terms of skill are not adequate," Mukherjee said after laying the foundation stone for the Bengaluru Dr B R Ambedkar School of Economics here.
