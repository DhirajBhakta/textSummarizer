Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday denied any rift with senior leader Kumar Vishwas after an AAP MLA accused the latter of trying to break the party at the BJP's behest.Aam Aadmi Party MLA Amanatullah Khan alleged that Kumar Vishwas was conspiring to break the party and had asked some legislators to join the BJP with an offer of Rs 30 crore each.This prompted Kejriwal to say that attempts were being made to create a rift between him and Kumar Vishwas, one of the founders of the AAP and a long-time friend of both Kejriwal and his deputy Manish Sisodia.Khan circulated a WhatsApp message saying Kumar Vishwas had called some AAP MLAs to his home with the monetary offer at the behest of the Bharatiya Janata Party."
Khan confirmed to IANS that he had circulated the message because "Kumar Vishwas wants to usurp and break the AAP".In a TV interview on Friday, Kumar Vishwas said the party won't hesitate in taking a call on change in its leadership after its poor show in Delhi municipal polls.The AAP finished much behind the BJP in all three wings of the municipal corporation.
