Actor Dia Mirza, who was in Delhi to walk for designer Anju Modi at the India Couture Week 2017, has not just a lovely face but also a strong mind. 
In this era of non-stop trolling, Dia recalls how, in her early days in Bollywood, she was targeted for expressing her opinion on various issues. 
The 35-year-old actor was trolled  on social media  when she had tweeted and urged her fans to play a dry Holi.
