"In addition to exhibiting low reflection, our nature- inspired film is also scratch resistant and self-cleaning, which would protect touch screens from dust and fingerprints," said Wu, who led the study published in the journal Optica. 
The coating can also be used with flexible display applications such as phones with screens that fold like a book, which are expected to hit the market as soon as next year. 
Many of todays smartphones use a sensor to detect bright ambient light and then boost the screens brightness level enough to overcome the strong surface reflection.
