The shy guy couldnt gather the courage to tell his parents about his love life and that leads to a big-intra family feud that ends when Charans uncle swears to marry him off in exactly one month.However, Kartar Singh (Anil Kapoor) is yet to arrive and add more confusion to the already-messed up affair.Mubarakan is a typical Bazmee film which starts with loud background music and solid bass.
