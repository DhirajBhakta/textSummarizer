Austrias parliament has passed a law allowing authorities to expropriate the house in which Adolf Hitler was born in 1889.The law, passed on Wednesday night, ends years of dispute between the buildings owner, Gerlinde Pommer, and the authorities in Braunau am Inn. 
But quite what the government plans to do with it remains unclear.While their main aim is to prevent the building becoming a shrine for the steady stream of neo-Nazi supporters who still make their way to Braunau, there has been an ongoing discussion over what more positive purpose it might serve.
