Modi, the internationally recognised eye surgeon, has been waging a one-man war against blindness. 
In 1986, his name appeared in the Guinness Book of World Records for performing 833 eye operations in a day, the highest in the world. 
The operations were conducted in Tirupati in 1968 over 14 continuous hours. 
Modi. 
And his labour has always been free.For Modi, his mission is spiritual. 
"I see myself as a poojary. 
That meeting changed his life. 
And Modi, the gifted ophthalmologist, dedicated his life to the sightless."
I felt affected when I saw blind people begging. 
They just did not have money to go to doctors." 
Modi recalled.And those who had the money had often sold their jewellery or livestock to put it together for the treatment. 
Ambidextrous, he performs delicate eye surgeries with his left hand. 
He does cataract operations, squint corrections and cornea transplants. 
Earlier, Modi used to perform 600 to 700 operations a day in his camps. 
But now in Karnataka, he operates on 200 to 300 patients every day.His phenomenal contributions for the sightless have not gone unappreciated. 
Recognition has come to him through the Padma Shree and Padma Bhushan. 
In his mass eye camps, apart from the 5.79 lakh operations, he has examined 50 lakh patients and given free food to over 100 lakh persons.Initially Modi had a hard time communicating his mission to the people. 
"Villagers used to ask me if I was that good, why was I operating for tree? 
Modi reminisced.
