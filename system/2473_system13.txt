The latest ones to be arrested in the case were an aerospace engineer who earlier worked for NASA and a businessman.Five of those arrested are B Tech graduates who held good positions in various MNCs.The officials had stumbled upon the Tollywood angle earlier during the investigation when they found that the clientele of the gang comprised nearly 1,000 customers, including students of city-based schools and colleges, a film producer, senior officials of MNCs and employees of IT firms in Cyberabad.The racket hinged around peddling of narcotics like LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide) and MDMA (methylenedioxy-methamphetamine).The department had earlier seized 800 squares of LSD, each costing Rs 3,000, and 35 grams of MDMA worth Rs 1.4 lakh.LSD, sold in tablets or in liquid form, is known to be one of the most potent mood-changing chemicals, while MDMA, commonly known as molly or ecstasy, is used primarily as a recreational or party drug.The two-member SIT was constituted on July 3.In view of the probe revealing disturbing facts on use of drugs by students, the department had sent advisories to 26 schools and 27 colleges asking their respective managements to sensitise teachers and students against the malady of drug abuse.First we concentrated on student users and now focus is on other users, the official added.
