EasyJet is urgently seeking answers after a worker at Nice airport apparently punched one of the airlines passengers who was holding his baby at the terminal after a 13-hour delay.A photo circulating online appears to show the man, believed to be a special assistance provider at the airport in south-east France, attacking the man in front of other passengers on Saturday.A fellow passenger said the man was struck after families had been held up because of delayed flight EZY2122 from Nice to Luton, with little access to information or space to sit down.
