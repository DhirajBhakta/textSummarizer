The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) is all set to launch a record 103 satellites in one go using its workhorse PSLV-C37 in the first week of February.As many as 100 of the satellites set for launch in February belong to foreign nations, including the United States and Germany. 
"We are making a century by launching over 100 satellites at one go," said S Somnath, Director of the Liquid Propulsion Systems Centre of the ISRO.That ambitious figure is an improvement on the space agency's statement last week that said it will launch 83 satellites in one go.
