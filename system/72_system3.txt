While most actors in Bollywood are acquainted with the prevalence of pay disparity in Bollywood, very few actually muster the courage to come out and talk about it. 
The actor, who has worked in films such as Tanu Weds Manu, Raanjhanaa, Prem Ratan Dhan Payo and Anaarkali of Aarah, asserts that even the roles being offered to female actors need to be at par with men.Although Swara agrees that things are slowly changing, she adds that there will be more progress only when female actors start being a little more assertive. 
In Hollywood, women are taking up this whole question of equality and I think that?
