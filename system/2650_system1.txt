Free drinks for the ladies at clubs in Delhi's Hauz Khas Village might see an end, as Delhi Police is considering to ban ladies' nights. 
The decision might bring about an end to the night-party culture in Hauz Khas, as bars and restaurants will be shut. 
However, police has appealed to ban ladies' night at Hauz Khas Village till Independence Day.According to a Navbharat Times report, police will soon decide on which pubs and bars will be allowed to host such parties. 
As Delhi plans to impose this ban, women are of the view that the government imposes witless bans when they should be taking actions against those who ridicule the law and order.Navbharat Times reports that South Delhi's DCP, Ishwar Singh confirmed that there are pubs and bars in Hauz Khas Village which host night parties for women on Tuesdays and Wednesdays.
