The RJD and the Congress have accused Kumar of being an opportunist and joining hands with communal and fascist forces he had promised to take on.Reports have said Kumar and finance minister Arun Jaitley spoke to Yadav and tried to mollify him.Prasad said on Saturday he had spoken to Yadav and invited him to lead the fight against the BJP and Kumar.Kumars decision to end the so-called grand alliance not only altered dramatically the political scenario in Indias third most populous state but also dealt a blow to the opposition parties looking to replicate the Bihar model to take on the BJP in the 2019 Lok Sabha election.
