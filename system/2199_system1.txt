						While the police team too was initially taken aback by Irfans reputation, a further investigation into his life revealed that he harboured a dream to make it big in local politics and all his social work was a conscious effort to realise his dream.He would don kurta-pyjama and frequently upload pictures of his social work on Facebook. 
He once offered to give Rs 10,000 at a bar in Delhi if the live performers there sang a song of his choice, said Romil Baaniya, DCP (south-east).Irfan has told his interrogators that he would never wear shoes or slippers while committing the burglaries that mostly involved breaking into houses through doors or windows of houses locked from outside.
