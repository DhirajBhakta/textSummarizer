Motor mouth Kolkata cleric Mualana Noor-ur Rehman Barkati continues to remain defiant despite three separate police complaints against him for defying the law and making derogatory comments. 
When India Today questioned him on the illegal use of the beacon, an angry Barkati retorted asking, "Why are you so concerned about my red beacon""No one has the guts to remove my red beacon. 
His response comes just a day after multiple police complaints were filed against him for illegally using the red beacon and making hate speeches. 
"What's my crime Why will I be arrested Just because I speak the truth Does anyone has guts (to arrest me)...I'm not scared," he hit back.On Friday BJP Yuva Morcha supporters demonstrated in central Kolkata demanding Barkati's immediate arrest, accusing the cleric of making anti-India statements.
