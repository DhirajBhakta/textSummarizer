We will not let the land acquisition take place for the airport project because the state government is cheating farmers by giving them only Rs3,500 per square metre (psm) for land. 
We are likely to start a campaign telling all villagers along the expressway not to give their land for the project until the UP government gives better compensation,? 
said Ajaypal Sharma, district president, Bharatiya Kisan Union.The Greater Noida and Yamuna Expressway authorities are buying land from farmers through direct purchase for Rs3,000 to Rs5,000 psm. 
Direct purchase means that if a farmer is willing to sell land, the authority will buy it instead of acquiring it through the Land Acquisition Act, 2013.?
We will educate farmers who give up land for the airport project and start a big protest soon as all farmer unions are together on this issue,?
