Ranbir Kapoor and Katrina Kaif's Jagga Jasoos has been in the making for almost four years now. 
But a few days before its release, the makers were in for a shock when the Central Board of Film Certification decided to give it a U/A certificate. 
This decision has made the makers quite unhappy. 
A source close to director Anurag Basu was quoted as telling the daily, "We wonder what the censor board saw in Jagga Jasoos that made it suitable for children only accompanied by an adult."
