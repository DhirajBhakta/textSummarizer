An amount of Rs 12 crore has been allocated for the project.According to officials, the project aims to supplement the efforts of Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board (DUSIB) and Railways the agencies responsible for providing infrastructure facilities in slums.Densely populated areas, especially those located close to railway lines, have no space for constructing community toilets. 
Since the work doesnt belong to us, we have decided to place mobile vans to stop people from defecating in the open, the official said.According to parameters of the Swachh Bharat Mission, any urban local body can declare its wards ODF only if it is successful in providing public conveniences at 75% of its areas.
