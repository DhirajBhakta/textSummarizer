HBO kept its place at the top of the Emmy nominations tree with its robot western series Westworld bagging 22 nominations at this years event, which saw it tie with the comedy show Saturday Night Live for the most nods.The haul amounted to one fewer nomination than HBOs usual Emmy juggernaut Game of Thrones managed last year, and was a shock to some observers who predicted a more modest showing from a series that had a mixed reception upon its release.The show will battle it out for the top honour, outstanding drama series, alongside Better Call Saul, House of Cards, Stranger Things, The Crown, The Handmaids Tale and This Is Us. 
Homeland and The Americans missed out.Westworld also had a good showing in the acting categories, with Sir Anthony Hopkins and Evan Rachel Wood nominated for best lead actors and Thandie Newton and Jeffrey Wright recognised in the supporting actor categories.Saturday Night Live also received 22 nominations, including a nod for Alec Baldwin and his impression of Donald Trump, while Kate McKinnon, Leslie Jones and Vanessa Bayer, were all recognised in the best supporting actress in a comedy series category.On Thursday morning in Los Angeles, the Veep actor Anna Chlumsky and the Criminal Minds star Shemar Moore read out the nominations. 
Aziz Ansaris Master of None is also up for best comedy, and Ansari for best comedy actor, while HBOs The Night Of took 13 nominations.Viola Davis was nominated again for best actress in a drama series for her role in How To Get Away With Murder, and Sterling K Brown was nominated for best actor in a drama series for his performance in This Is Us.The only real shocks came in the best talk show category, where Jimmy Fallon missed out and Bill Mahers Real Talk was nominated despite controversy surrounding the host, who used the N-word on the show recently. 
Samantha Bees Full Frontal was also included, while Jerry Seinfelds Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee missed out.Other shows that missed out were the Leftovers, which didnt bag any nominations in the main categories, plus Girls and Transparent which both missed out in the best comedy series category.
