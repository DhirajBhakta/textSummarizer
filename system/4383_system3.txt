Eight fishermen from Tamil Nadu's Pudukkottai district were arrested by Sri Lankan officials yesterday.Seven of these fishermen are being held in Triconmalee in Sri Lanka, and will be presented in court at the earliest.The other fisherman attempted suicide soon after being taken into custody, and has been admitted to the Triconmalee hospital.In just the past week, 26 fishermen and four trawler boats from India have been taken into custody. 
Talking about the delayed action by the Sri Lankan and Indian governments, Alexander said, "After the two countries talk...we thought that there will be an end to our problems, but sadly the situation still continues and our fishermen still face arrests and threat of being killed in the sea all the time."
