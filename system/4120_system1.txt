The police, however, took help of a counselor to convince them after which they were taken to DDUhospital in Hari Nagar for treatment. 
In his statement, the elderly man said that he has been getting them treated by a local doctor, as he did not have enough savings to take them to a hospital, an official said. 
He also said that whenever he took them to the doctor, they refused to tell their symptoms to the doctor because of which they could not be treated, he added.
