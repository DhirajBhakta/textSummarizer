Lucknow, Feb 14 (PTI) The NDA government has "not waived even a single paisa" of any industrialist and Rahul Gandhi is levelling "false allegations" in this regard, Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley asserted today. 
"Actually, he is levelling false allegations against the previous UPA government as most of the non-performing assets today belong to those who had been given loans by the Congress-led government," he claimed.
