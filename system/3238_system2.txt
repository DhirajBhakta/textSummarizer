Veteran Telugu actor Chalapathi Rao has landed in legal trouble after his derogatory statements on women. 
At the pre-release event of the upcoming Telugu film Rarandoi Veduka Chudham, Chalapathi Rao said that women are only fit for having sex with men. 
I always respect women personally and in my films/I definitely do not agree wt Chalapati rao's derogatory comments/dinosaurs do not exist!!
#respectwomenpic.twitter.com/mXYZCvMPwIRespecting women is a way of life for me.The reactions shown on TV weren't for the statement made.Do I agree with it ?
"Rao defended his statements saying, "But I was angry when they asked me if 'girls are harmful'. 
That's why I said woman are harmless and that's why we sleep with them. 
I will never insult a woman. 
I will always treat women with respect like mothers and sisters."
