Speaking from his bed at the hospital, which has been treating him free of charge, Bajandar said the pain of his condition had been unbearable. ?
I never thought I would ever be able to hold my kid with my hands,? 
I can hold my daughter in my lap and play with her. 
The plight of Bajandar, who comes from a village in the southern coastal district of Khulna, was brought to wider attention after his condition was widely covered in local and international media. 
He met his wife, Halima Khatun, before he contracted the disease, but it had taken hold by the time they married ? 
Bajandar initially thought the warts were harmless, but they eventually covered his hands and feet, forcing him to stop working.
