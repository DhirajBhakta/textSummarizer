New Delhi, May 19 (PTI) Traders body CAIT today suggested the first nine months of GST, from its rollout date of July 1, should be treated as a trial period and no punitive action taken against businesses for procedural mistakes to allow them to get familiarised with the new regime. 
Commenting on the outcome of the GST Council meeting that concluded today, CAIT Secretary General Praveen Khandelwal said that classification of goods under different tax slabs of GST are by and large fitted in the correct basket and it is expected that goods will become cheaper under the new indirect tax regime.
