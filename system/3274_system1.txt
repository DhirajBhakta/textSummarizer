New Delhi, May 19 (PTI) Traders body CAIT today suggested the first nine months of GST, from its rollout date of July 1, should be treated as a trial period and no punitive action taken against businesses for procedural mistakes to allow them to get familiarised with the new regime. 
The CAIT further said that while the GST should be implemented from the scheduled date of July 1, the remaining nine months of the current fiscal "may be declared as trial period" and except habitual offenders, no action should be taken against traders for procedural mistakes.
