Not bad for a player who they said would not make it to the top.He was not finished. 
He never got to play for England schoolboys and I can remember Harry Redknapp, the West Ham manager, asking me why Frank wasn?
Lampard is synonymous with consistency and durability; only Ryan Giggs and Gareth Barry have made more Premier League appearances than his 609 while his run of 164 consecutive matches remains a record for an outfield player. 
and it is questionable whether he got the credit he deserves for his exceptional short and long passing.In the end, though, Lampard was defined by his goals; the timing of the runs, the technique and the power of the execution.
