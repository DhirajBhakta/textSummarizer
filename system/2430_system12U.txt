Researchers hope that this new instrument will help empower and rehabilitate patients with motor disabilities such as those from stroke, spinal cord injury or amputation.The Encephalophone is a musical instrument that you control with your thoughts, explained first author Thomas Deuel from the University of Washington. 
I thought it would be great to use a brain-computer instrument to enable patients to play music again without requiring movement.Deuel originally developed the Encephalophone (patent pending) in his own independent laboratory, in collaboration with Felix Darvas, a physicist at the University of Washington.
