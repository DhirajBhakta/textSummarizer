 Come July 15, no e-attendance would mean no salary for officials from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). 
Civic officials said of the 1.07 lakh employees in BMC, almost 70,000 have been brought under the biometric attendance, the rest will also be incorporated by July 15. 
The tough stance is against employees who benefit from administrative leniency and skip work by just signing on the register.
