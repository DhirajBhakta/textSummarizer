In the video, the minister allegedly asked the crowd to beat the photograph of the Prime Minister with slippers.The video was shot on February 22 when Mastan, a Congress leader, was addressing a Jan Vedna rally against demonetisation in his constituency of Amour in Purnia district.As the BJP leaders protested in the Assembly demanding the minister's expulsion from the cabinet, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar condemned the remarks and called them wrong.Senior BJP leader and former deputy chief minister of Bihar Sushil Modi said "regret by CM Nitish is not enough and Mastan should be sacked from the cabinet".Mastan, in the eye of a major political storm, apologised for his remarks. 
"I apologise if my statements have hurt anyone," the minister said.
