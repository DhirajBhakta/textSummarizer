Producer and CBFC chairperson Pahlaj Nihalani is not a fan of the International Indian Films Academy (IIFA) awards. 
Nihalani says many actors who were taken to New York did not even attend? 
It is our foreign exchange being squandered as every top star is given tickets for his spouse, children, parents , ayahs, bodyguards, friends, friends of friends .?. 
IIFA is selling Indian cinema to various countries and probably getting many financial benefits. 
I think the day Mr Bachchan opted out, IIFA lost its dignity and relevance. 
Initially we had cinema from various states getting token representation at the awards.Now we only have Bollywood.
