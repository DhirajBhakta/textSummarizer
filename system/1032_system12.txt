The Delhi government has released Rs100 crore for the Signature Bridge project, which was hit by a fund crunch slowing down its last phase of construction.Delhi tourism minister Rajendra Gautam said, on Monday, that the finance department has sanctioned the amount after examining the contractors demand for an additional Rs250 crore. 
Gautam, who had inspected the bridge earlier, had written to the chief secretary, saying that the work should not go on beyond December 31, this year, under any circumstances.This fresh infusion of funds will ensure that work, which had considerably slowed down, resumes.
