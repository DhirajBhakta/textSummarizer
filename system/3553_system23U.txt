Delhi Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) chief and MP Manoj Tiwari today had breakfast with slum dwellers of Samaypur Badli. 
Accompanied with Leader of Opposition Vijendra Gupta, he visited the slum and had his morning meal at a resident's house."
Breakfast is just a gesture, I am making notes about the problems of the area. 
The slums are deprived of water, sewage and toilets.
