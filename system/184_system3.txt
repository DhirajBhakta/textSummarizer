Three top professors have left the faculty for greener pastures over the last six months, a development which insiders say is unprecedented in AIIMS history.Dr BS Sharma, senior professor from neuro-surgery, who was a member of AIIMS faculty for more than 25 years, has joined a private medical institute in Jaipur while another professor from the department, Dr Sumit Sinha has moved to Paras Hospitals, a super speciality medicare chain. 
In last three years, approximately 17 young faculty members have resigned because of poor salary and non-availability of accommodation," the faculty member said.The FAAIIMS letter also points out that senior most faculty members "get no promotion for 15 to 20 years".
