A court order protecting them and several reports pointing out their importance notwithstanding, wetlands across the state continue to be destroyed. 
Between 2012 and 2017 alone, 523 cases of wetland destruction were reported, a report compiled by the Mumbai-based NGO Vanashakti revealed at the National Mangrove Conference in Dona Paula, Goa, on Thursday.
