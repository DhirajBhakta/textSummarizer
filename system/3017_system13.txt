Shah Rukh Khan was in Paris long ago, when he doodled certain things on a piece of paper. 
The doodle is from Shah Rukh's 1997 Paris visit and is soon going to be auctioned off.The doodle, which has the Eiffel Tower in the centre, with King Kong climbing the monument with the damsel in distress, is all set to go under the hammer.
