But not anymore.Ever since the Mumbai-based comedy group All India Bakchod (AIB) used his photograph alongside a morphed picture of Modi with dogs ears and a snout superimposed, triggering a controversy, Ramachandran, 61, has grown tired of his resemblance with the prime minister.I will shave off my beard next week, he said on Saturday. 
They used Ramachandrans photograph alongside a picture of Modis face with the Snapchat dog filter, using the hashtag #Wanderlust.Not many found it funny and the Mumbai cyber police on Friday filed an FIR against AIB co-founder Tanmay Bhat for insulting Modi.However, Ramachandran, now retired after having worked in the Gulf for several years, insists he is an ardent fan of Modi.
