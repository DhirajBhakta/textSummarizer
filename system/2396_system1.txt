A 13-year-old girl from south Delhi, who allegedly eloped with her neighbour two months ago, returned last week and was found to be three months pregnant. 
said Romil Baaniya, DCP (south-east).The girl, however, has reportedly told a city court that she wants to be with the man and should not be forced to return to her parents, said the DCP. 
When she did not return, a search was launched in the neighbourhood, before a missing complaint was filed .When raids at the homes of Iddu Khan and his relatives yielded no results, the father approached a city court at the advice of his employer.  ?
