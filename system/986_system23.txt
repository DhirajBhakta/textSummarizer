The Ladies Professional Golf Association (LPGA) has come in for stiff criticism after it introduced a new dress code that forbids female golfers from sporting plunging necklines, leggings or revealing skirts on the course.Initial reactions were overwhelmingly negative, with Teen Vogue accusing the governing bodys policy of slut-shaming female players. 
The specifics of the policy have been shared directly with the members.Former European mens tour player Matt Blackey was sceptical of the new regulations, tweeting Im not sure a stricter dress code will help golfs appeal, while golf writer Robert Lusetich tweeted that his former Sunday school teacher must have been writing the code.
