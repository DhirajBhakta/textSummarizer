Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi took a dig at the NDA government by tweeting a video which shows a couple in a restaurant paying the bill. 
He took a jab at NDA government's policy for poor.? In the video, the boy gives a currency note to the waiter but the girl insists on paying the bill. 
She then goes on to take the money back from the waiter and gives him her money. 
However, what is funny is that she puts his money into her purse instead of giving it back to him.
