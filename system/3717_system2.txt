Germaine Mason, the British athlete who won a high jump silver medal at the 2008 Olympics, has died in a motorcycle accident in Jamaica.The 34-year-old was riding at the front of a convoy with a number of athletes, including Usain Bolt and the 2005 world championship 100m silver medallist Michael Frater, as well as the former Bolton defender Ricardo Gardner, when he lost control of his bike on the Palisadoes main road in Kingston.Our sincere condolences to the entire sporting fraternity.Unconfirmed reports suggest he was trying to avoid a vehicle that had lost control on the other side of the road. 
Such sad news. https://t.co/dBECw1WbtFMason qualified for Britain by virtue of a British father, who, confusingly, lived in Jamaica while his Jamaican mother lived in west London. 
Our staff and colleagues who worked with Germaine are naturally saddened to hear this awful news. 
Fuzz Caan, the senior high jump coach at British Athletics who worked closely with Germaine at the time of his Olympic success, added: ?
He was a great ambassador of British high jumping.
