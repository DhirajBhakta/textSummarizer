I would like to tell people that Modiji is not going to run MCD MCD will only be run by Kejriwal, the AAP national convener told Hindustan Times in an interview on Thursday.The AAP is making its debut in Delhi civic elections, being billed as a barometer for the Kejriwal governments popularity two years after it won an overwhelming mandate in the assembly polls.Kejriwal argued that Delhis elected government has been reduced to an advisory role because all files went to the Lieutenant-Governors office for clearance, but things would be different in the MCDs.
