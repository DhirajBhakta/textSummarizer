Through economic valuation of ecosystem services from six tiger reserves in India, we demonstrate that enhanced investment in these tiger reserves is economically rational, he says.The team analysed the economic benefits accruing to the country from Corbett Tiger Reserve that is home to 215 tigers, Kanha Reserve (80 tigers), Kaziranga (106), Periyar Reserve (35), Ranthambore (46), and the Sunderbans Tiger Reserve (76).The tiger estimates are all from 2014 when the National Tiger Conservation Authority gave its last countrywide census figures.A simple back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests that each tiger has a flow benefit of about USD 2.19 million per year.This can be viewed as the interest one earns annually by conserving each tiger.
