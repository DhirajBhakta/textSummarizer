It's Day 4 of Panneerselvam vs Sasikala duel in Tamil Nadu. 
While both the leaders appeared confident of claiming the chief minister's chair, the governor is yet to formally take a call. 
A note surfaced late Friday night indicating that the Tamil Nadu governor is not inclined to invite Sasikala to form the government. 
However, in a major blow to her, the Congress today said it will not back the AIADMK general secretary in the power struggle. 
O Panneerselvam or VK Sasikala? - who will win the battle for Tamil Nadu's throne?
She has majority. 
What is the Governor waiting for?
