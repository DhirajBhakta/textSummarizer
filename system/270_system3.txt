In wake of a major drug bust earlier this month in Hyderabad, actor Rana Daggubati said it worries him and its really dangerous to know that school children have been involved in this racket. 
The month-long investigation brought to light the drug trade in Hyderabad, which involves not only Tollywood stars and MNC professionals, but also school students from reputed institutions.Commenting on the drug bust scenario, Rana said, Honestly, the whole thing has been blown out of proportion. 
If a filmmaker or an actor takes drugs, it really doesnt bother me. 
I dont give a damn if you take drugs.What worries Rana is that children are taking drugs. 
The dangerous story about school kids doing drugs worries me.
