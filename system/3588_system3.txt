Sir Martin Sorrell received ?48m in remuneration last year as WPP, the marketing and advertising company he founded and runs, moved to curb the level of his future payouts to avoid further clashes with investors.Sorrell, who has been on the receiving end of a string of shareholder voting revolts at WPPs annual meetings in recent years, received total pay, bonuses and incentive scheme payouts of ?48.1m in 2016.The figure is 31.6% lower than the ?70.4m he received in 2015, one of the biggest pay deals in UK corporate history, which was opposed by one-third of WPP shareholders at last years AGM. 
It is long effort over a long period of time.The question of a successor has exercised investors in recent years, with Guy Jubb, the former head of governance at Standard Life Investments, using his final appearance at a WPP annual meeting in 2015 to criticise the apparent Sorrellcentricity at the company.Quarta, writing in the annual report, said there is a list of internal and external candidates who could take over.As part of our continuous assessment of those individuals who might one day become chief executive of the group, we have invited a number of leaders within WPP companies to present to the board and attend board meetings, he said.
