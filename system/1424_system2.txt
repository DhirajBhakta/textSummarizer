"The canteen stores department (CSD) and the unit run canteens under it have been asked by the services to turn cashless from March 1 as they will sell goods only using plastic money," sources told Mail Today here. 
The CSD has almost 1.2 crore direct customers in form of serving and retired personnel along with their families and had a turnover of over Rs 13,000 crore last year. 
In the army, orders were issued by the adjutant general's branch to canteens that they have to turn fully cashless from March 1 and the local formations have been asked to spread the message among the serving and retired personnel, the sources said. 
The local formations have issued advisories to the retired personnel that they should arrange credit or debit cards by March 1 as the canteens are turning cashless, the sources said. 
For military personnel, its easy to turn cashless as all their personnel get their salaries in their bank accounts and have already been issued debit cards by their respective banks long time back, the sources said. 
The pensions of the retired soldiers and officers are also disbursed through banks and they have also been given the plastic cards.
