Fake accounts in the name of L-G Anil Baijal surfaced on Sunday and Monday, after an account was created by the L-G House on Sunday. 
A senior official at the L-G house said, We received several complaints and alerts from the general public about some fake Twitter accounts. 
Police said they would look into allegations that the fake account users had posed as L-G Baijal and tagged other politicians, including chief minister Arvind Kejriwal.
