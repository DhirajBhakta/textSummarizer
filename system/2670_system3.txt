New Delhi, Jul 4 (PTI) The Congress today attacked the AAP government for "delaying" the fourth phase of the Delhi Metro project by not paying its due share. 
The mass transport system in Delhi will collapse due to the "delay" in the Metro project, claimed Delhi Congress spokesperson Sharmishtha Mukherjee. 
"The fourth phase of the Delhi Metro project is facing obstacles due to the attitude of the AAP government. 
It is deliberately delaying the project by not giving its due share of taxes," Mukherjee said in a press conference.
