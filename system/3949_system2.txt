To circumvent the  500-metre liquor ban on pubs, bars and restaurants, the developers in Gurgaon are changing the entrance to their properties; making  motorable distance more than 500 metres and moving these establishments out of the purview of the Supreme Courtorder. 
More than 150 bars and pubs in Gurgaon have been hit by the Supreme Courts ban on liquor sale within 500 metres of state and national highways.
