The Noida authority has decided to names all lanes in villages for easy identification of different pockets in each village. 
Officials said that the move is aimed at improving civic amenities in villages. 
Poor civic amenities in villages affect urban areas as well, officials said. 
Villagers have been demanding a unique address (land title) for many years as it will give their properties a legal status and enable them to get loans, on a par with flat or plot owners. ?
said Mishra.The authority in January 2016 had started a drive to name lanes of Bishanpura and provide adequate facilities but if fizzled out.
