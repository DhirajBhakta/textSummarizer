But the Global Seed Vault, buried in a mountain deep inside the Arctic circle, has been breached after global warming produced extraordinary temperatures over the winter, sending meltwater gushing into the entrance tunnel.The vault is on the Norwegian island of Spitsbergen and contains almost a million packets of seeds, each a variety of an important food crop. 
When it was opened in 2008, the deep permafrost through which the vault was sunk was expected to provide failsafe protection against the challenge of natural or man-made disasters.But soaring temperatures in the Arctic at the end of the worlds hottest ever recorded year led to melting and heavy rain, when light snow should have been falling.
