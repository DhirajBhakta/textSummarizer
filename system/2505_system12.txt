A student of William Perkin C of E High School in Greenford, Karanbir died due to an allergic reaction. 
An allergic reaction occurred because a piece of cheese was 'thrown' on him.The Cheema family demanded answers from the school and authorities whether their son was bullied at school or not.According to a report by The Independent, Karanbir's mother Rina said that he had multiple allergies but led a life of normalcy."
I want answers, I want to get to the bottom of what happened, I will be asking the school if he was bullied but my son was very popular, you could not help but like that child, he never made enemies."
