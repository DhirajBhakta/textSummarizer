In an extreme form of street crime, three men chased a 20-year-old youth for several hundred metres before beating him to death on the main platform of the busy Adarsh Nagar railway station in north Delhi.At least 50 passengers and vendors stood and watched as the three men rained punches and kicks on Rahuls head, chest and private parts. 
The three could have easily gotten away after the murder but for a head constable who decided to take on the killers and nab them.While Rahul could never live to tell his story, the killers have claimed in police interrogation that they were chasing Rahul as he had allegedly snatched Rs20,000 from one of their hands.
