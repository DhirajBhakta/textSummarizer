Louis on Sunday.The self-proclaimed 'Modern day Maharaja' gave a 'Khallas' -- a variation of the 'Full Nelson Slam' to finish off the 14-time champion and get the three count.Orton, who was distracted by the Singh Brothers went on a rampage outside the ring as he hit them off with RKO's and made sure there's no more distraction coming his way. 
But as far as Randy (Orton), I just want to say that he is a 14-time WWE champion and he made a rookie mistake.
