Through this free access to Wi-Fi, all students will be able to get internet connection and use educational resources such as online courses available on SWAYAM platform through the National Knowledge Network. 
The company plans to create hotspots for this,? 
a source said.This is the first time the ministry has received a proposal of this kind from a telecom service provider. 
The government, therefore, wants to ensure other providers have a ?
fair chance?.?
Though they (Reliance) are not charging us any money for this project, we can?
t approve it without giving a fair chance to others. 
A tender will be floated so that it is a fair and transparent process,? 
added the source.

When contacted by HT, Jio?
s representatives refused to comment on the issue.Significantly, even the HRD ministry?
s proposal to provide free Wi-Fi to central universities, which has been in the pipeline for quite some time, is also likely to take off this year. 
HRD minister Prakash Javadekar had recently announced that 38 universities would be made Wi-Fi enabled by August 31 this year.
