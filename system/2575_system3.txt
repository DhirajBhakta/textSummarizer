China will completely block access to much of the global internet as part of a sweeping crackdown aimed at suppressing dissent and maintaining the Communist partys grip on power.The government has ordered Chinas three telecommunications companies to completely block access to virtual private networks, or VPNs, by February 2018, Bloomberg News reported, citing anonymous sources. 
Internet controls also mean news and commentary critical of the ruling Communist party and information about events like the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre are almost impossible to find within China.But millions of Chinese citizens circumvent Chinas censorship system, known as the Great Firewall, by using a VPN, allowing unfettered access to any website. 
The latest directive comes as China prepares for a twice a decade political meeting in Beijing in late 2017, with various factions within the government jockeying for dominance in any potential shuffle of top officials. 
This is clearly about the highest levels of political struggle and the different factions using the internet as their battlefield.If Xis opponents cannot release information inside China because of the censorship apparatus, they do it outside China and then the information filters back.Xiao pointed to recent cracks in the Great Firewall, including allegations of corruption levelled by a Chinese businessman in New York that have managed to circulate widely within China.
