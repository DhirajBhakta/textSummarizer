Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) chief Swati Maliwal visited the victim at AIIMS and said the womens panel will set up a committee to look into the incident.It is very shocking that in the capital of this country a 15-year girl was gang-raped and then the accused in this case had the audacity to attack her again after 10-15 days of the incident. 
Apparently, he shot at her but the bullet hit the mother, who is the only person supporting the victim in the case, said Maliwal.Police sources said that the victim was three weeks pregnant and broke the news to her mother in the second week of December.
