India is all set to launch communication satellite GSAT-19 into space today using a monster rocket. 
The satellite launch vehicle--the Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle Mark-III (GSLV Mk-III)--is the heaviest rocket till date. 
Its weight is equal to that of five fully-loaded Boeing Jumbo Jets or as much as 200 fully grown elephants. 
"All activities for our GSLV-Mark III launch tomorrow are going on in Sriharikota, expecting launch at 5:28 pm," said AS Kiran Kumar, chairman of Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) on Sunday.The ISRO chairman called the launch an important event as it will help India put communication satellites into space from its own soil.The GSAT-19's successful launch will pave the way for the launch of GSAT-11--a heavier communication satellite--into the space in the near future.
