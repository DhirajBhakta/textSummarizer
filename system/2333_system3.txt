The corpses began arriving last spring, but as the mission to oust Isis fighters from the once-thriving city intensified, so too did the number of dead floating towards the west bank town of Qayyarah.I see dead bodies in the water daily, said Ahmed Mohammed, a driver, speaking earlier this year. 
(Once) the body of a boy also floated by but we could not catch it as it was too small and went through the gaps in the barrier, said the driver Mohammed, who is haunted by guilt at letting the young boy drift away.Human rights organisations had raised alarm about the number of unsolved killings in and around Mosul city and in particular the corpses washing up along the Tigris river. 
Human Rights Watch (HRW) said evidence points to government forces, killing suspected Isis members or collaborators without trial or due process.Warning of the killings in April, Lama Fakih, deputy Middle East director for HRW said: The bodies of bound and blindfolded men are being found one after the other in and around Mosul and in the Tigris river, raising serious concerns about extrajudicial killings by government forces.
