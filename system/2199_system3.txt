But, in his native village in Bihars Sitamarhi district, Irfan portrayed himself as a social worker who organised health camps and funded the weddings for poor families -- all to fuel his political ambitions.The police were on his trail ever since May this year when he allegedly stole gold and diamond jewellery worth lakhs of rupees from a house in New Friends Colony. 
He was, however, caught on a CCTVcamera and it did not take the investigators too long to identify him.Once his address was known, police raided his native village and nabbed him on July 6. 
He was consciously creating that image to fuel his dreams, said an investigator.When the police team traced him to his village earlier this month, residents of his village refused to accept that Irfan was a thief who would frequently steal from the rich residents of south Delhi. 
He once offered to give Rs 10,000 at a bar in Delhi if the live performers there sang a song of his choice, said Romil Baaniya, DCP (south-east).Irfan has told his interrogators that he would never wear shoes or slippers while committing the burglaries that mostly involved breaking into houses through doors or windows of houses locked from outside.
