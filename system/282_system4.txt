Detectives investigating two separate rapes of a 14-year-old girl in Birmingham have arrested two men.The pair, aged 35 and 27, were arrested on Saturday morning on suspicion of carrying out the first rape of the girl, on Tuesday evening, following the release of CCTV images of two suspects.Officers continue to appeal for information in connection with the second rape in the early hours of Wednesday. 
I am still looking to hear from anyone who lives locally to Witton and saw a young girl walking by herself during the early hours of Wednesday morning. 
The man suspected of carrying out the second rape is described as thick set, about 5ft 6in, with large biceps.
