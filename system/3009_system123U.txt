As the Uttar Pradesh government is planning to make marriage registration mandatory, Muslims are getting ready to come out on the roads in protest of this 'un-Islamic' move.Talking to India Today on this issue, Muslim leader Haji Jameeluddin said the Muslim community cannot accept the UP government's edict to register Muslim marriages at the marriage registrar's office as Muslim marriages are only registered at the office of the Waqf board of UP as per the Nikahnama documents.He said Muslim marriages are already registered according to the Sharia law and there was no need to register them again merely to satisfy a government's whim.He said the attention of both the Centre and the state governments have shifted from development and crime control to such frivolous issues.
