In a tweet after the meeting, External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Gopal Baglay said the Prime Minister asked for UKs "cooperation for return of escaped Indian economic offenders". 
To a query on whether was Mallya in focus in terms of escaped economic offenders discussed with May, Baglay said, "We have put out a tweet and the term used there is a plural... its English language and people who know English should understand it". 
Asked whether all on the list were discussed and no specific names were mentioned, he said, "I wont like to go into that and what we have said in the tweet is what our position is".
