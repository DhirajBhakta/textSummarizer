A smog-free tower is a sevenmetre-high air purifier, the largest in the world, which takes in polluted air particles and expels cleaner air. 
Each air purifier tower, which contains three small in-built purifiers and the outer shell, is effective within the radius of 300 metre to 7 km, claims its manufacturer company.One unit of the giant purifier costs somewhere between `1.8 and `2 crore and it takes about three months to manufacture a single unit. 
Experts say that the standing air purifier sucks in 75% of the particles in the nearby air that are dangerous to humans, and then spits out clean air into the surrounding space. 
But with local politics involved, an immediate step is unlikely soon, hinted officials adding, "but we are putting up 19 ambient air quality monitors to assess the peak pollution time causing the rise in Delhi's air pollution levels".
