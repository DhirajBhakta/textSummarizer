Protected shape marks are not without precedent  Toblerone, which is owned by Mondelz, has successfully trademarked its zigzag prism shape.But the appeal judges found that while the four-finger shape might be very well known in association with KitKat, that does not necessarily mean that the public have come to perceive the shape as a badge of origin such that they would rely upon it alone to identify the product as coming from a particular source.They might simply regard the shape as a characteristic of products of that kind or they might find it brings to mind the product and brand name with which they have become familiar.These kinds of recognition and association do not amount to distinctiveness for trademark purposes.The judges also noted that the chocolate bars shape had not been central to its marketing in recent years: It has nothing, therefore, to do with the informed choices that consumers make between similar products.The judges heard that Nestl? had spent between ?3m and ?11m a year advertising and promoting KitKats between 1996 and 2007.
