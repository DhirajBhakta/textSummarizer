In a bid to placate Sangrur MP Bhagwant Mann, Aam Aadmi Party convener and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal today made him the chief of the party's Punjab unit.Sources said the decision was taken at a meeting held at Kejriwal's official residence. 
AAP's chief whip in the Punjab Assembly, Sukhpal Singh Khaira, quit his post in protest the appointment of Mann as AAP's Punjab unit chief.Besides, Gurpreet Singh Waraich 'Ghuggi', who has been replaced by Mann as the state chief, is also learnt to be upset at his removal.About a fortnight ago, Mann had lashed out at AAP's leadership for the party's defeat in the Punjab Assembly elections.
