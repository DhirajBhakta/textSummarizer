Chandigarh, June 28 (PTI) The Punjab and Haryana High Court today issued a notice to the Punjab government, less than a week after the state Assembly amended the Excise Act, 1914 removing hotels, restaurants and clubs from the restrictions on serving of liquor within 500 metres of highways. 
The notice was issued for July 24 by a vacation bench of Justice Anita Chaudhry and Justice Harminder Singh Madaan on a petition filed by NGO Arrive Safe Society through its president Harman Singh Sidhu. 
Sidhu contended that the Supreme Court had directed all states and union territories to forthwith cease and desist from granting licences for the sale of liquor along national and state highways within a distance of 500 metres.
