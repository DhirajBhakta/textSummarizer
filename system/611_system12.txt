But one long-standing stalwart of the Windows experience has been put on the chopping block: Microsoft Paint.First released with the very first version of Windows 1.0 in 1985, Paint in its various guises would be one of the first graphics editors used by many and became a core part of Windows. 
Starting life as a 1-bit monochrome licensed version of ZSofts PC Paintbrush, it wasnt until Windows 98 that Paint could save in JPEG.With the Windows 10 Creators Update, released in April, Microsoft introduced the new Paint 3D, which is installed alongside traditional Paint and features 3D image making tools as well as some basic 2D image editing.
