It could easily be mistaken as a CGI photo, given the stunning improbability of capturing a lightning bolt striking an angry, erupting volcano. 
Selected from more than 15,000 entries from participants in more than 30 countries, the photograph by Sergio Tapiro Valesco captures volcanic lightning -- also known as a dirty thunderstorm -- whereby a flash of lightning is produced within the ash cloud spewing from the volcano. 
Titled The Power of Nature, the photo was taken 12 km away from the crater of the active volcano on a clear night. 
For more than a decade, Velasco has been studying and photographing Mexicos Colima volcano, also known as the Volcano of Fire.  
What I was watching was impossible to conceive, the image showed those amazing forces of nature interacting on a volcano, while the lightning brightened the whole scene.
