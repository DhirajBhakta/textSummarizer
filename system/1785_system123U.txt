Islamic State wants to carry out a mass casualty attack in Britain and has no moral barrier to using chemical weapons, a minister has said.The security minister Ben Wallace said there were reports of Isis using chemical weapons in Syria and Iraq, where it controls large areas, and that Moroccan authorities had apprehended a cell in February which was harbouring substances that could be used to make either a bomb or a deadly toxin.He also pointed to a recent Europol report that warned of the chemical threat and the potential realisation of everybodys worst fear.He told the Sunday Times that the groups ambition was definitely mass casualty attacks.
