A day after the Election Commission issued him a notice for allegedly promoting bribery, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday reiterated his appeal to voters to accept bribes offered by political parties but cast their ballot for his Aam Aadmi Party (AAP).If they are being offered Rs 5,000, I would tell them to ask for Rs 10,000 from Akali Dal, BJP and Congress but vote for AAP, the partys national convenor said in Chandigarh.Addressing the media, Kejriwal claimed that this matter has been already settled in court.Someone had filed a case when I said the same thing before the Delhi elections but the court ruled that Im not promoting bribery but stopping it, he said.But the poll panel on Monday issued a notice to Kejriwal over the violation of the model code of conduct for his reported remarks in poll-bound Goa.
