West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee today said that her party will boycott the special midnight session of Parliament on June 30 to launch the landmark Goods and Services Tax or GST in the country.Expressing her concerns about the GST implementation, Mamata said the Centre was unnecessarily hurrying to launch the key tax reform. 
According to the Bengal CM, at least six more months were required? to notify all rules and procedures and give enough time to the stakeholders, particularly the Small and Medium Enterprises to successfully implement the GST.Targeting the Centre for any an impending chaos in the economy, Mamata said states were being pressurized to make interim arrangements for GST roll-out.
