A woman who had to catch an early morning train had a horrifying experience when a man was masturbating looking at her at Mumbai's CST railway station.? What's more shocking is that when she called a police posted at the railway station where the accused was present, he did nothing and asked the woman to sit somewhere else and left.The woman filmed the entire incident and posted it on social media on July 12.
