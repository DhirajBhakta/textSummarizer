After 6 Congress MLAs left the party in Gujarat ahead of the crucial Rajya Sabha election, Congress flew several of its remaining MLAs outside the state to prevent, what they call, horse-trading."
To ensure BJP is not successful, 44 of us Congress MLAs are leaving from Gujarat for Bengaluru," Congress MLA Shailesh Parmar had said."
To hide their failure, BJP is trying to make sure our MLAs resign by offering money and through police pressure," he said.In the end 4 MLAs stayed back in Gujarat, but 40 have landed in Bengaluru, in Karnataka. 
Crores of rupees have been spent in horse-trading in Gujarat by the BJP. 
Singhvi also accused the BJP of adopting unlawful measures and, with the use of money and power, forcing the Congress MLAs to switch sides and quit the Assembly.
