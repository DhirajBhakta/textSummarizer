The railway ministry plans to introduce its ambitious integrated ticketing system in the next three years and Mumbai will be the first city to experience it. 
The project will be executed in two stages: in the first, the software will be integrated with the existing ticketing system and in the second, entry and exit gates will be installed at stations. 
MRVC will present the railways perspective to the MMRDA, which is the primary organisation for the integrated ticketing system, said Prabhat Sahai, chairman and MD, MRVC.Sources said chief minister Devendra Fadnavis is keen on the project.  
The Brihamumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST), which runs bus services, and Mumbai Metro One Private Limited (MMOPL), which manages the Versova-Andheri-Ghatkopar Metro, have agreed to modify their ticketing systems for the new tickets. 
With new Metro lines coming up in the city, MMRDA said the single ticketing system would be a boon to travellers. 
The consultants for the Metro lines will submit a detailed report to the body on the systems implementation.
