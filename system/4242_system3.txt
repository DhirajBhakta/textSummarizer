Controversy's child Rakhi Sawant has made a habit of making shocking comments. 
From expressing her desire to marry the "hot" and "sexy" Baba Ramdev to saying that every woman "should take coaching classes on how to give pleasure," Rakhi always manages to outdo her last bizarre remark. 
In an interview with Navbharat Times, she said that as a child, she used condoms in place of water balloons to play Holi."
As kids, when we lived in the chawl, we would throw water balloons at each other. 
When we did not find balloons, we would fill condoms with coloured water and use them instead. 
I did not know what condoms were, back then, so I played with them a lot."
