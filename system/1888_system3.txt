Tokyo, Dec 26 (PTI) Scientists in Japan have developed a new urine-powered sensor that can alert caregivers when a diaper is wet and ready to be changed. 
Producing a sensor suitable for a diaper proved to be a challenge, researchers said. 
They first developed a urine sensor too rigid to embed into a diaper. 
The new diaper sensors overcome all of those problems by using a urine-activated battery, Gizmodo reported.
