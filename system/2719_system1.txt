Washington, Jul 4 (PTI) Scientists, including one of Indian origin, have developed a smart headlight system for the first time that can help drivers see through heavy rain or snowfall and safely navigate roads during stormy nights. 
The light projection system then adjusts to deactivate light beams that would otherwise illuminate the particles in their predicted positions. 
Lab tests have demonstrated the feasibility of the system and the researchers are confident that the speed of the system can be boosted.
