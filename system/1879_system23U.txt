Cairo, Dec 26 (PTI) In a "stunning" discovery, archaeologists have found compelling evidence of new pharaonic tombs behind a 4,200-year-old wall unearthed in Egypt. 
The two-metre high ancient encroachment wall has been found below a visitors pathway in the West Aswan cemetery at Qubbet el-Hawa, Egypts Ministry of Antiquities said. 
The wall is thought to indicate the architectural support for the known tombs of the first upper terrace, including those of Harkhuf and Heqaib, who were governors of Elephantine Island during the Old Kingdom.
