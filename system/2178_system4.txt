From Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Lil Champs to The Voice, Sabse Bada Kalakaar to Junior Masterchef India and Super Dancer, reality shows featuring children are a common feature on Indian television.Last week, filmmaker Shoojit Sircar, known for films like Piku, Pink and Madras Caf?, tweeted that authorities should ban reality television shows for children. 
At an age when all they should be worried about is playing, studying and having fun, children are entangled in a web of competition and stress.This is not the first time that a discussion on the need to regulate child participation in reality shows has come up.
