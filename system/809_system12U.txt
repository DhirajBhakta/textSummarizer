DunkirkDirector - Christopher NolanCast - Tom Hardy, Fionn Whitehead, Mark Rylance, Harry Styles, Cillian Murphy, Kenneth BranaghRating - 5/5The moments spent in anticipation immediately before a new Christopher Nolan movie are often just as nerve-wracking as those spent watching the film.
And the electricity youve created  together  in the cavernous place of worship, could power a small town.I have experienced this sensation on four occasions, before four Christopher Nolan films, and each of those experiences were, and remain to this day, some of the most special Ive had inside a movie theatre.And yesterday, it happened again.Dunkirk, a film about men, created by men, is a force of nature  an elemental beast of a movie about finding the meaning of life surrounded by the meaninglessness of war.
