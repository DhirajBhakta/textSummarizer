For kicking off the initiative, the authority has decided to name lanes of Jhundpura village.We are completing the necessary formalities to start the process of naming lanes in Jhundpura. 
Our demand for a clear land title is yet to be addressed, said Singh.As of now, we will only name the lanes and address civic issues. 
We will look into other demands of villagers later, said Mishra.The authority in January 2016 had started a drive to name lanes of Bishanpura and provide adequate facilities but if fizzled out.
