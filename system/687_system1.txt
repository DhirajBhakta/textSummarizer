An analysis of remuneration disclosures made by top listed companies forming part of the blue-chip index Sensex -- under directions of the capital markets regulator Sebi -- shows that the pay packages of senior-most personnel such as CEOs and executive chairmen continue to remain high and rose further at most private sector firms during 2016-17.
