While she agrees that the position of female comedians has improved, she says it will take time for more progress, as Indian comedy is a male-dominated field.Its more difficult for a good-looking girl to enter comedy, because such girls usually  want to do acting first and look pretty. 
They could perform anything, but being a female, I cant do everything. 
Like toilet humour, I cant do double-meaning comedy and I dont approve of it either. 
I dont even look funny that if I crack a joke on myself,  people will laugh. 
I have always worked on my choices and left shows where I have been uncomfortable.
