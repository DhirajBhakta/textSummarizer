To their shock, when they returned, they found BhakyaSri's dead body in a freezer box kept at the doorstep. 
According to testimony of BhakyaSri's neighbours, they saw the staff of the treatment centre drop off the freezer box on June 3. 
BhakyaSri's relatives claim that Naveen Balaji who runs the herbal treatment centre in Erode is a fraud and has no authorisation from medical bodies or the government.
