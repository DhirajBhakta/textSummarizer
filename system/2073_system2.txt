Jews are better educated than any other major religious group in the world, with an average of 13.4 years of schooling and a majority going on to higher education, a study has found.At the other end of the educational scale, Hindus and Muslims have the fewest years of formal schooling, with an average of 5.6 years.The main reason for the disparity is that Jews are largely concentrated in Israel and the US, countries with high levels of education generally, whereas 98% of the worlds Hindus live in the developing countries of India, Nepal and Bangladesh.Among Muslims, those that live in countries with strong economies are well-educated, but those who live in developing regions have comparatively short periods of formal schooling  and girls fare worse than boys.But there are also notable differences between religious groups in the same areas of the world, such as sub-Saharan Africa, where Christians are generally better educated than Muslims.The study, Religion and Education Around the World, was published on Tuesday by the Washington-based Pew Research Center.It found that, compared with the Jewish average of more than 13 years of formal schooling, Christians had 9.3 years, Buddhists 7.9, and Muslims and Hindus 5.6.
