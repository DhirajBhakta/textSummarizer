After Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrashekhar Rao moved into a sprawling estate of nine acres worth nearly Rs 50 crore in Hyderabad, all state legislators are expected to follow suit. 
The Telangana government is building office-cum-residence bungalows for all MLAs, which will be constructed in their constituencies within a 500 square yard area. 
These 'camp offices' for all 117 legislatures will be constructed on a budget of Rs 1 crore each.
