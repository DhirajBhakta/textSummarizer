Agitating doctors in Maharashtra have been asked to resume work by 8 pm today or risk losing six months' worth of salary, state minister for medical education Girish Mahajan said today. 
The notice warned the doctors that if they fail to resume work, then they could be expelled and their medical registrations could be canceled, as per a January 31, 1996 Government Resolution.Meanwhile, the Indian Medical Association's Maharashtra chapter has lent its support to the physicians, expressing 'deep pain' at the "recent spate of events of unabated violence against doctors."
