For ASI Raj Singh, 52, his son was guilty of stabbing a woman who spurned him and had to be brought to justice. 
Singh knew his son deserved to be behind bars and had even threatened his relatives against helping, Amit, evade arrest. 
Singh, posted in the west district, was on a seven day medical leave, when he learnt about his son?
s involvement in the Najafgarh stabbing case.

house in Roshanpura to check if Amit was hiding there. 
A senior officer said that when he spoke to Singh, the man said that his duty came first and he was a cop who would treat his son like any other suspect. 
Joint commissioner of police (south west) Dependra Pathak confirmed that Singh had helped the police. ?
The ASI helped the investigating team in locating his son. 
We respect his commitment towards his duty. 
He has certainly set an example for others,?
