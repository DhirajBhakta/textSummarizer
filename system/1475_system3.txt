On Wednesday night, when Delhi police were grappling for clues to crack the case, Singh walked into the Najafgarh police station and offered to help the investigating officer arrest his son. 
Singh, posted in the west district, was on a seven day medical leave, when he learnt about his sons involvement in the Najafgarh stabbing case. 
A senior officer said that when he spoke to Singh, the man said that his duty came first and he was a cop who would treat his son like any other suspect. 
Joint commissioner of police (south west) Dependra Pathak confirmed that Singh had helped the police.
