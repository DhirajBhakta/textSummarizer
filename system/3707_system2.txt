From Lalit K Jha Washington, Apr 20 (PTI) Describing the ongoing Goods and Services Tax (GST) reform as an "act of courage", IMF chief Christine Lagarde today said she expects "some positive outcome" as a result of the decision. 
"So, I am personally impressed by the work that is being done in that regard and expect some positive outcome," Lagarde said in response to a question, adding that she is impressed by the other reforms being carried out by the Indian Government. 
One of them - as a former lawyer I am particularly attentive to because it particularly when you have to deal with the corporate sector banking sector that means help -- is the bankruptcy reform," the 61-year-old IMF chief said.
