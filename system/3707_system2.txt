From Lalit K Jha Washington, Apr 20 (PTI) Describing the ongoing Goods and Services Tax (GST) reform as an "act of courage", IMF chief Christine Lagarde today said she expects "some positive outcome" as a result of the decision. 
It really means reforming in-depth in each of the Indian States in order to substitute the State taxes with overall federal tax, the re-allocation of it and the digital platform that supports it, she said. 
"So, I am personally impressed by the work that is being done in that regard and expect some positive outcome," Lagarde said in response to a question, adding that she is impressed by the other reforms being carried out by the Indian Government. 
Lagarde said the situation in the country after demonetisation has "improved significantly".
