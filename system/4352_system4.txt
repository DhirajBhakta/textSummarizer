New Delhi, Mar 6 (PTI) Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal today said Delhi will be made as clean as London keeping its unique cultural ethos intact, seeking to clarify his earlier remarks which have been mocked by the Opposition. 
Delhi will be made as clean as London, which only the AAP can do," he told reporters. 
While addressing a gathering yesterday, Kejriwal had said that if the AAP won the MCD polls, it would spruce up Delhi and make it look like London within a year. 
Over his Londons remark, Delhi BJP President Manoj Tiwari hit out at Kejriwal, saying "he should first make Delhi a better Delhi before planning to make it London."
