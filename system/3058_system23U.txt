Kolkata will soon have an underwater Metro which will pass through tunnels several feet under the Hooghly. 
The first underwater transportation tunnel of India is ready with the second one nearing completion. 
The Kolkata Metro transportation tunnel is unique to India because never before in the history of the country has a tunnel been made under a flowing river.The tunnel has been constructed 30 metres below riverbed, just a few metres away from the famous Howrah Bridge, built in the last century to connect Howrah and Kolkata.
