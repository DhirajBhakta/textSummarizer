The Valley saw a massive slump in tourist arrival since the death of Hizbul Mujahideen Commander Burhan Wani in July last year. 
The year 2016 saw? an impressive 11 lakh tourists heading to the Valley for vacations till July before Wani's death. 
The MHA sources said, "The decline in this year's visitor number is due to the extended winter season and snowfall, and not militancy related incidents."
"I called couple of hotels today including? The Lalit, Taj and Sarovar, but they are all full, because of an official delegation. 
There have been incidents of stone-pelting in Srinagar that has affected the numbers." says a dejected Mahajan, hoping that tourism might pick up now.
