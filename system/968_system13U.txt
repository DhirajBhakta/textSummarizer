PATNAAt 26,?Bihar deputy chief minister Tejashwi Prasad Yadav owns as many property as his age  all hidden from public gaze.Thats what senior BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi claimed on Tuesday with documented proof, even as the JD(U) and the RJD attempted a political compromise after taking the Grand Alliance to the edge of a political precipice over CBI charges against the deputy CM, said to be a prime beneficiary of a hotel for land deal going back to the days when his father and RJD chief was railway minister.Post the CBI FIR, which involves Tejashwi, 26, directly to the ownership of a mall on the outskirts of Patna  said to be a sweetener paid by the hotel owners to Lalu Prasad for awarding rights to two railway hotels  the fresh allegations came as a counter to the compromise that the RJD dictated by directing Tejashwi to meet chief minister and explain his stand.
