Tirupati, Dec 21 (PTI) Devotees of Lord Venkateswara who want to trek the Tirumala hills here on foot will now have to produce their Aadhar card as identify proof for getting authorised tickets for privileged special entry darshan and laddus. 
At present, devotees after reaching Tirumala are given some laddus free of cost and subsidised laddus besides special entry into the shrine, temple PRO Talari Ravi said today. 
The devotees who do not have Aadhar card can submit any authorised identity proof to avail the facility midway on the 10 km long stairway leading to the shrine.
