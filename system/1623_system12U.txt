A physiotherapist arrested for the murder of a 28-year-old bank manager in north Delhi stole an anaesthetic from AIIMS to make the lethal cocktail he injected his victim with, Delhi Police sources said on Tuesday. 
Ravi Kumar, who worked with Kotak Mahindra died on Monday, two days after Prem Singh jabbed him in Sadar Bazaar, where the bank branch was. 
It gave him the idea that an injection could be used to murder Kumar and make a quick buck, a source said.
