According to reports, the bus was carrying nearly 50 students of JS Vidya School when it collided with a truck in Aliganj area of Etah district.The truck was being driven at a high speed when the two vehicles collided head-on. 
The bus was so badly damaged in the accident that rescuers had to use gas cutters to pull out the bodies and injured kids.
