New Delhi, Jul 21 (PTI) Industry body COAI today termed the launch of JioPhone a "clever marketing" and said Jio selling the device at effective zero price is an attempt to save government levies like licence fee by the company. 
COAI Director General Rajan S Mathews said the Jios announcement is a bundled offer and the plan to sell it at an "effective zero price" is a "clever marketing position" as the move will help the company save licence fee and other government levies. 
"Reliance Jio offer is clever marketing position... they are saying the handset price is effectively zero. 
In such cases, there will be dilution for Jio from customers paying Rs 303 moving to Rs 153," Mathews said.
