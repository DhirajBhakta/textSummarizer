The National Green Tribunal, the highest environmental court in the country, today slammed Sri Sri Ravi Shankar for alleging bias in a tribunal committee's recent report on Yamuna riverbed damage. 
The report criticised Art of Living's World Culture Festival, held in March last year, for damaging the Yamuna riverbank and went to quantify the damage caused. 
"The ground is now totally levelled, compacted and hardened and is totally devoid of water bodies or depressions and almost completely devoid of any vegetation," the 47-page report also said."
