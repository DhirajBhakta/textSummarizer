The controverisal Finance Bill of 2017, that was introduced by Finance Minister Arun Jaitely as a Money Bill in the Lok Sabha, and gotten it passed with the majority the Bharatiya Janata Party enjoys in the lower house, was reintroduced today after the Rajya Sabha recommended five amendments to it. 
The Opposition has termed the introduction of the amendments as "back-door" legislating and taking away right of Parliament to frame laws.Jaitley defended the amendments with the argument that they were all "incidental provisions" to the Finance Bill.
