Manchester City have taken their summer spending to more than ?200m with the signing of Benjamin Mendy from Monaco and increased their total outlay in the transfer market since Pep Guardiola took charge 13 months ago to ?385m.The transfer fee of ?52m (57.5m) for Mendy is a world record for a defender and is Guardiolas latest signal of intent as he seeks to build a squad capable of winning major silverware in his second season at the Etihad Stadium.Citys spending is closing in on Real Madrids record for money outlayed in a single transfer window by one club, set when the Spanish club spent 257m (?230m) in the summer of 2009 bringing in Xabi Alonso, Karim Benzema, Kak? and Cristiano Ronaldo.Mendy, who has signed a five-year contract with City, had been identified as a key target by Guardiola following the departure of the left-back Ga?l Clichy at the end of last season and Aleksandar Kolarov, who left for Roma last week after seven years at the club. 
He switched to Monaco last summer for ?11m where he established himself as one of the best full-backs in the world with his powerful and direct style of play as the club claimed the French title and reached the Champions League semi-finals.Like Walker, Mendy is at his most effective going forward and City will hope the duo can add a surge of energy in wide areas that was lacking last season; Guardiola received some criticism for switching between four and three at the back and deploying his full-backs in unfamiliar roles tucked into midfield.
