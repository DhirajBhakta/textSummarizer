The fossils suggest that fungus may have evolved from under the deep sea rather than land. 
Drilled from rocks that were once beneath the seafloor, the fossils resemble living fungi and could push back the date for the oldest fungi by one to two billion years. 
There is a "clear possibility" that they are the worlds oldest fossil fungi - twice as old as generally accepted in the fossil record, Bengtson was quoted as saying by the BBC News.
