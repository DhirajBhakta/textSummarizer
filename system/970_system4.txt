Austen becomes the first female writer (following in the footsteps of William Shakespeare and Charles Dickens) to feature on a banknote.The note, launched by the Bank of England at Austen?
It joins the Churchill ?5 in the first family of polymer UK banknotes; a ?20 note featuring JMW Turner will follow in 2020. 
The ?10 note has security features that the Bank says make it very difficult to counterfeit. 
This is in addition to the elements already incorporated in UK banknotes for visually impaired people: the tiered sizing, bold numerals, raised print and differing colour palettes.Austen fans will have to wait until later this year before they can begin to use the notes.
