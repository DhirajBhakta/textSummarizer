Former Australian middle-order stalwart Michael Hussey has urged Steven Smith's men to not try and rile India captain Virat Kohli in the four-Test series which starts this month. 
The young Aussie captain felt distracting his India counterpart would be advantageous for him. 
(Kohli's witty response to journalist: Sri, if I do everything, what will the others do?)
Mr Cricket, as Hussey is fondly known for his astute cricket brain, may have hit the nail on the head again. 
Apart from one episode that involved a spat with Ben Stokes and another press conference in poor taste from James Anderson, the series was largely played in good spirits.
