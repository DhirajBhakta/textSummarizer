Now that his upcoming films Toilet: Ek Prem Katha and Padman bear a social message, he?
I am doing different kinds of characters and they are not chosen on the basis of a particular message to give in a film. 
Whichever script I find exciting, I take it up. 
t want anybody to say that I am an action or a comedy hero. 
I want people to think ki ye koi bhi role kar leta hai (He can do any kind of a role),? 
I did a film 8 x 10 Tasveer (2009) but not even 4 by 5 people came to see it in theatres (laughs).
