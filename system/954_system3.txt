A bitter stand-off between a local community and miners has emerged after a significant seam of gold was found on protected conservation land in New Zealands North Island.Last week New Talisman Gold Mines reported they had found a large vein of gold in the Karangahake Gorge in the North Island; 8,500kg of highest quality gold which put it in the top five percent of deposits worldwide when ranked on grade, according to the company.The find is believed to be worth tens of millions of New Zealand dollars.Talismans general manager of operations Wayne Chowles said the company planned to begin extracting small amounts of gold early next year, but locals in opposition to the scheme have sprung into action, saying the mining project threatens the peace and harmony of their sacred mountain and community.The Karangahake Gorge lies on protected department of conservation land in the Coromandel peninsula and is a popular destination for tourists and locals alike. 
The reality is that gold-mining makes money for a few people, but we are the ones that pay the cost, we will have to live with a degraded environment and an altered sense of peace in the mountain.Green Party MP Catherine Delahunty said industrial scale gold mining on Karangahake mountain would turn a beautiful recreational park and sacred mountain into an industrial zone.This is public land which has been set aside to protect its ecological values and for recreation. 
It is a sacred mountain to the indigenous people of the area and local residents are actively and peacefully opposing the initial development of the mining activity on the mountain.The New Zealand Government is also hell bent on opening up conservation areas to mining but they do not have a mandate to destroy our precious places New Talisman were granted a 25-year mining permit to prospect and mine on conservation land in Karangahake in 2009, using an existing underground mine that has been in operation at various times between 1892 and 1992. 
It is legal to mine on conservation land in New Zealand if the government and local council grant a permit and if land access is given from the department of conservation.As of May there were 43 active mines on conservation land in New Zealand, according to the ministry of business, innovation and employment.New Talisman have all the consents they need and the government insists mining activity wont affect the historic gorge.
