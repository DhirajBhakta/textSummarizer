The aim is to fill most of the interior walls at the concourse levels with paintings and photographs, a metro official said.On the Magenta Line, the stations have been re-designed where instead of the traditional walls and windows, the concourse and platforms will be made of cemented honeycomb design for enhanced ventilation. 
A committee, comprising five members including artist members from Delhi College of Art and Lalit Kala Academy, shortlisted 365 images and 36 artists which were found suitable for display on nine Metro stations, another official said.Earlier this year, the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) had unveiled interior designs for stations on the Heritage Line (Central Secretariat  Kashmere Gate).
