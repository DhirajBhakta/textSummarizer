The video ends with Sharad Kelkar, a Bollywood and television celebrity, asking parents and friends to be responsible and keep a tab on what their children/friends are doing online.Over the last few years, the Maharashtra ATS has dealt with a lot of cases where youngsters have been radicalised online and brought into the Islamic State fold. 
However, keeping the complexity in mind the Maharashtra ATS has initiated a policy under which parents are requested to come forward and inform them if they see any changes in the behaviour of their children and if they find them suddenly spending a lot of time on the internet. 
The video is another step by the agency to help expand its intelligence while stopping radicalised youths from taking any extreme steps.
