Interpol has circulated a list of 173 Islamic State fighters it believes could have been trained to mount suicide attacks in Europe in revenge for the groups military defeats in the Middle East.The global crime fighting agencys list was drawn up by US intelligence from information captured during the assault on Isis territories in Syria and Iraq.European counter-terror networks are concerned that as the Isis caliphate collapses, there is an increasing risk of determined suicide bombers seeking to come to Europe, probably operating alone.There is no evidence that any of the people on the list, whose names the Guardian has obtained, have yet entered Europe, but the Interpol circulation, designed to see if EU intelligence sources have any details on the individuals, underlines the scale of the challenge facing Europe.The list, sent out by the general secretariat of Interpol on 27 May, defines the group of fighters as individuals that may have been trained to build and position improvised explosive devices in order to cause serious deaths and injuries.
