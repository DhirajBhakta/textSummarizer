The National Democratic Alliance (NDA) has called for a state-wide dharna and protest to demand the ouster of Bihar minister Abdul Jalil Mastan, who called Prime Minister Narendra Modi a "Naxal" and a "Dacoit" at a Congress-organized Jan Vedna rally in Purnea on February 22. 
"The Minister has said that he was not present at the rally on the day, so what is the purpose of him apologising for his tirade against the PM," asked senior BJP leader Sushil Modi.The BJP alleged that the nation's sentiments were hurt by the insult to the PM, and have threatened to carry on with their agitation in the street, as well as inside the Assembly.
