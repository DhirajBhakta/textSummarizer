London, Mar 18 (PTI) A five-legged lamb has been born at a farm in the UK and named after a Tom Hanks character. 
The Texel Mule cross was born on Thursday in Derbyshire and farm owner Mark Bayley said he was totally healthy. 
The Bayley family nicknamed the young male Forrest in the hope his extra limb gives him the same love of running as film character Forrest Gump.
