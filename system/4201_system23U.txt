Pakistan's disgraced former Test captain Salman Butt, who has served a five-year ban for spot-fixing, has urged cricket authorities to target those who try to corrupt players at any level of the game."
The players are seen as the main culprits whenever some corruption comes out. 
But I think the International Cricket Council and its member boards also need to think about how to also punish those people who try to lure players into fixing," Butt said on Geo Super channel.Butt, who was the mastermind of the 2010 spot-fixing scandal during Pakistan's tour of England, said that until people, who try to corrupt cricketers are also punished, it would be difficult to eradicate the menace."
