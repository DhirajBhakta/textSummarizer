India and Tamil Nadu off-spinner Ravichandran has improved a lot and is a smart cricketer, legendary Sri Lanka bowler Muttiah Muralitharan said today.?
he told reporters on the sidelines of an TNPL event here.Muralitharan, who holds the record for most Test wickets, however, said the Lanka team?
I am happy that the present Sri Lankan team is absolutely new. 
But I can notice the team is slacking a bit in overall performance these days. 
I have been associated with the team for quite a long time. 
But in the near future, if I again get an opportunity to work with CSK, I will enthusiastically do it,?
