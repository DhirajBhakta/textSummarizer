Since Lord Krishna was a "legendary Eve-teaser," will Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath - who has unleashed 'anti-Romeo' squads in a crackdown on sexual harassment - have "the guts" to call these teams "AntiKrishna squads"That's precisely the question lawyer and Swaraj Abhiyan co-founder Prashant Bhushan posted on his Twitter account earlier today. 
OWAISI'S POTSHOT Bhushan's remark comes a day after MP Asaduddin Owaisi took a pot shot at the BJP's policies on beef in two states - Uttar Pradesh, where a crackdown on illegal slaughterhouses is underway, and Nagaland, where there's no such policy yet.In fact, Visasolie Lhoungu, the Nagaland BJP chief, told the Hindustan Times, "(A) ban on cow slaughter like the one in UP won't take effect in Nagaland if our party comes to power next year.
