Unhappy with the compensation being offered, farmer leaders of Greater Noida have decided to start a campaign in Jewars villages asking other farmers not to give their land for the proposed airport project.Their opposition may impact the airport project for which the state government needs 5,000 hectares in around 40 villages along the Yamuna Expressway. 
The Yamuna Expressway industrial development authority (YEIDA) is likely to begin land acquisition as the Centre has given its nod for the project.We will not let the land acquisition take place for the airport project because the state government is cheating farmers by giving them only Rs3,500 per square metre (psm) for land.
