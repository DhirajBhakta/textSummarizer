A dozen people, including two infants, were killed when a 35-year-old four-storey building collapsed on Tuesday in the Ghatkopar suburb of Mumbai, a tragedy that repeats almost every monsoon in Indias space-starved financial capital.The Siddhi Sai building at Damodar Park near Shreyas cinema in western Ghatkopar came apart and trapped more than 20 people around 10.45am. 
The Ghatkopar apartment did not feature among the dangerous buildings on the BMCs list of 791 structures identified unsafe this year.But Mumbai is susceptible with millions forced to live in cramped, ramshackle properties because of rising real estate prices and a lack of housing for the poor.The city has been hit by several deadly building collapses in recent years, often caused by shoddy construction, poor quality materials or ageing buildings.In 2013, 145 people were killed in three separate building collapses around Mumbai, the highest in recent years.A dilapidated building left 12 people dead when it collapsed near the city in August 2015.
