With the explosion of digital era and social media platforms came along a lot of opinions filled with hatred, meant to spread more hatred. 
For instance,? The fellow, who goes by the name "Jai Shri Ram" on Twitter, cannot fathom how a Hindu can wish people on Eid. 
This may make you question your belief in the secular fabric of India, but responses to such narrow mindedness will reinstate your faith in it. 
A photo taken at Delhi's Nazrat Nizamuddin Auliya Dargah, dargah of world famous Sufi saint Hazrat Khwaja Syed Nizamuddin Aulia, is another example that will prove that no amount of hatred peddled through social media platforms and instant messaging applications like WhatsApp can destroy the secularism in India, within Indians.
