White is also aware of the obstacles in its way, including the remainder of Lesnars suspension for failing a doping test last year.Its fun to talk about, but the reality of it happening anytime soon, its not a reality, White said.But its definitely a lucrative possibility if Lesnar decides to resume training for MMA.
