An Indiana woman who called off her $30,000 wedding threw a party Saturday for the homeless at the swanky event centre she had booked for the reception.Sarah Cummins told the Indianapolis Star she called off the wedding a week ago, but declined to give a reason.She was left with a non-refundable contract for the Ritz Charles in Carmel and a plated dinner for 170 guests.Cummins says she decided that rather than throw away the food she would bring some purpose to the event and contacted area homeless shelters.A school bus pulled up Saturday from one organization and about a dozen homeless veterans stepped off to join the party.
