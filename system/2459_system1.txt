New Delhi, Jul 13 (PTI) Markets regulator Sebi has asked Goldmine Agro Ltd (GAL) and its directors to refund investors money that the Kolkata-based company had raised illegally by issuing securities. 
However, the company had not given details about the number of allottees. 
The regulator observed that allotment of NCDs by the firm was a public issue, which under the rules require a compulsory listing on a recognised stock exchange.
