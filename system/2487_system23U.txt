A Canadian lobster fisherman who saved dozens of endangered whales after they became tangled in fishing nets has been killed  moments after a last successful rescue.Joe Howlett, from Campobello Island, New Brunswick, boarded a vessel off the provinces eastern coast on Monday to help rescue a north Atlantic right whale that had become heavily tangled in rope. 
Just a few days before his death, Howlett had helped liberate another north Atlantic right whale in the region, cutting away a fishing line caught in its mouth.
