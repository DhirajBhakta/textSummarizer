Joining in the slanging match over the "donkey" barb targeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Congress leader Digvijay Singh today said he "indeed worked like a donkey"."
Modi ji, you very rightly said that you indeed work like a donkey," he tweeted.His dig at the Prime Minister came a day after Modi said he takes inspiration from the "loyal" and "hard working" animal and was amused that UP Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav was "afraid" of Gujarat's donkeys.Modi said the criticism of donkeys by Akhilesh only reflected his "casteist mentality" and "the feeling of hatred does not suit him"."
