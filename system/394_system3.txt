First we want to stabilise our prisoner strength.Jails in bigger states are struggling with chronic overcrowding  the result of a slow-moving justice system and years of failure to build new prisons by governments trying to rein in expenses.States such as Maharashtra, Karnataka, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh could be potential clients for Telangana, which was carved out of Andhra Pradesh in June 2014.We plan to charge Rs 10,000 a prisoner a month for their boarding and lodging, security, mulakat (meeting visitors) and training in various job skills, Singh said.Read more: Byculla jail riot: A reminder that jails in India are hellholesThe prisons department estimates earnings of roughly Rs 25 crore a year from the rental if the government clears the plan.The money would contribute to making our jails self-reliant, the prisons chief said.In Telangana and Andhra Pradesh jails, the average daily expenditure on a prisoner is Rs 120, which comes to Rs 43,800 a year.
