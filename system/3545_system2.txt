(EDs: Repeating after adding a word in intro) New Delhi, Apr 30 (PTI) At least 11 five-star hotels in the national capital, including the iconic Taj Palace and Claridges, are on the tax defaulter list of New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) with their total dues amounting to Rs 320 crore. 
The civic body, in a report prepared at the end of the 2016-17 fiscal, has identified these hotels among 166 alleged defaulters, which have dues pending above Rs 10 lakh for the last four years. 
However, according to NDMC officials, all the hotels have moved court challenging the tax assessment and any further action by the civic body cannot be taken since the matter is sub-judice. 
"On the defaulter list are hotels like Taj Palace (Rs 42 crore), The Leela (Rs 18 crore), Claridges (Rs 4 crore) among others, the highest being Delhi Golf Club which owes NDMC Rs 700 crore," said a senior NDMC official from the taxation department. 
Meanwhile, the spokespersons at Taj Palace and Claridges denied any pending dues, saying their payments till date have been made. 
A Delhi Golf Club official said there was a "huge issue" with the tax assessment leading to the amount in hundreds of crores.
