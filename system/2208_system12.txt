Is the reality not that its Moeen, not Dawson, whos been picked over Rashid My thinking behind that being that the balance of the team was meant to be a control spinner plus a wicket taking spinner, and that neither Moeen nor Rashid could fulfill the former role Im clearly not suggesting thats worked, by the way, but potentially that was the theory.Id say that in the end, the captain gets what he wants, because hes the one taking the players onto the pitch and its pointless giving him a bowler hed rather not bring on.
