Hours after Pakistan proudly announced the launch of the nuclear-capable Babur-3 cruise missile, reports today suggested that Islamabad may have faked the launch video. 
Experts, including a satellite imagery analyst based in Pathankot, have put out technical evidence to suggest that Pakistan has faked the missile video and used computer graphics to depict much of the weapon's flight. 
The analyst, in a series of tweets, claimed that Pakistan insidiously used a computer generated image of a missile over the background to show that Babur-3 was successful.
