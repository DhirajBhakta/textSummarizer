Lt Governor Anil Baijal "fires one bullet at me" every day, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said.This is Kejriwal's first direct attack at Baijal since he was appointed the Lt Governor of Delhi on December 31, 2016.Noting that his government tries to coordinate on various issues related to the development of the national capital, both with the Lt Governor as well as the Centre, Kejriwal said that "the firing" has intensified just before the MCD polls."
The committee had pointed out "gross abuse of power" by the AAP government earlier this month.Kejriwal also attacked the BJP claiming that is an "undemocratic and unconstitutional" party whose only intention to "topple opposition parties government, buy MLAs, break their parties, use the Lt Governor against them".
