Sridevi's elder daughter Jhanvi Kapoor may be getting ready to make her Bollywood debut, but the actor, like every desi parent, will be happier to see her daughter get married. 
In an interview with Mid-Day, Sridevi opened up about her daughters, Jhanvi and Khushi, and how they make her feel proud as a mother.Talking about Jhanvi's Bollywood debut, Student Of The Year 2, Sridevi said, "She wanted to do the film and initially, I wasn't in favour. 
Given their close bond, it is natural for the actor to take her children with her, wherever she goes. 
Last year, when Khushi wrote a post about body shaming on Instagram, I was pleasantly surprised to see my kid turn into a strong, opinionated and sharp young woman," she said.On the work front, Sridevi is gearing up for the release of her film, Mom, which will hit theatres on July 7.
