Chandigarh, May 1 (PTI) On August 15, as the country will celebrate its 71st Independence Day, the northern state of Haryana would become stray cattle-free. 
That is the target that Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar has set and work to rehabilitate abandoned cattle is already on in a mission mode. 
At a meeting here, Khattar said the tagging of 89.3 per cent of cattle in gaushalas and nandishalas (shelters for bovine animals) has been completed and Haryana would be made stray cattle-free by August 15, 2017.
