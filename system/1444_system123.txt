A?Swedish brewery called Pang Pang has partnered with a creative agency called Snask to create a product,?that has become the ultimate elixir for a blissful shower.Appropriately dubbed?as Shower Beer, this product?is "sweet, but strong" and "meant to gulp in three sips while standing in the shower."
The brewery's founder, Fredrik Tunedal, told VICE that he "wanted to optimise the experience of having beer in the shower by trying to customize a brew for this glorious occasion."
