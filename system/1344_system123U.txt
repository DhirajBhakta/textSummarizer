Bollywood actor Amitabh Bachchan has at least one Vodafone connection and it's giving him (some) trouble. 
The service is apparently so bad that Big B had to tweet about it. 
That he did. 
The last time he did something like this - on Twitter - Samsung had to replace his faulty Note 7, with a Galaxy S7 (of course). 
Something very similar happened this time round as well.
