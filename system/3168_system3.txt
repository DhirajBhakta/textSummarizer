The results of the class 12 Bihar Board has once again stirred controversy as Humanities topper Ganesh Kumar is untraceable since the examination results were declared on Tuesday.A resident of Saraiya, Giridih in Jharkhand, Ganesh Kumar was a student of Ram Nandan Singh Jagdeep Narayan college in Samastipur, 250 kms from Giridih. 
He also secured 92 marks out of 100 in Hindi.When India Today contacted Ganesh's family in Giridih, her sister Mukta said that he had left home almost four years back and did not go home all these years."
He left home four years back and during this time he never came to Giridih," said Mukta.It is notable that India Today, last year, unearthed the toppers scam and exposed how students became fake toppers after shelling out huge amount of money.
