The results of the class 12 Bihar Board has once again stirred controversy as Humanities topper Ganesh Kumar is untraceable since the examination results were declared on Tuesday.A resident of Saraiya, Giridih in Jharkhand, Ganesh Kumar was a student of Ram Nandan Singh Jagdeep Narayan college in Samastipur, 250 kms from Giridih. 
Kumar went underground soon after the results were declared, triggering suspicion over him securing the top spot in the Bihar Board examination.India Today, on Wednesday, reached Samastipur and while investigating, managed to get the admission form of Ganesh, which he had submitted in the college while taking admission in 2015. 
He left home four years back and during this time he never came to Giridih," said Mukta.It is notable that India Today, last year, unearthed the toppers scam and exposed how students became fake toppers after shelling out huge amount of money. 
This year, the Bihar School Examination Board claimed to have conducted the examination in a strict manner.
