The ridiculous Marital Declaration questionnaire asked IGIMS employees to mention their marital status. 
"I looked the dictionary for the actual meaning of the word virgin. 
It means unmarried and I don't find anything objectionable in the usage of the word," Mangal Pandey said."
However, when the issue was brought to my notice I enquired IGIMS management about it. 
They told me the format used in the form is the same which is used at AIIMS (All India Institute of Medical Science)," he added. 
Everyone has to fill this form which is part of Central Services Rules and this form is similar to what AIIMS in Delhi uses. 
If the Centre or AIIMS changes the format of the form in the future, we will also change it.
