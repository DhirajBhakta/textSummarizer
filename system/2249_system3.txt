It has 439 students, including 257 girls, in the two classes.After getting several complaints from the students of classes 11 and 12 that the boys create trouble, we were forced to take the decision of asking them to attend school on separate days, headmaster Kanchan Adhikari said.The decision was taken at a meeting of the schools managing committee.The district inspector of schools disapproved of the move.I am not aware  But if it is true, we will take necessary steps, said Rejaul Haque, the inspector in Birbhum district. 
Before taking this step, they should have consulted us.Headmaster Adhikari, who is the deputy head of the local panchayat, clarified that the decision is not permanent and the measure will be withdrawn if the students change their attitude.Parents are worried that the alternate-day schedule leaves students and teachers with little time to complete the syllabus.My son is attending school three days a week. 
The number of classes is reduced further in case of holidays, said a guardian who didnt wish to be named.For teachers, the segregation entails double duty as they have to teach the same lessons twice to the boys and the girls separately.We are aware that it will be difficult to complete the syllabus.
