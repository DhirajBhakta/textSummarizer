Steve Whitmire, the puppeteer who was fired after 27 years as Kermit the Frog has said he is ?
He wrote an emotional blog post in response to his firing a day after it was made public.He said he was let go against his will, and would never have left voluntarily.?
I feel that I am at the top of my game, and I want all of you who love the Muppets to know that I would never consider abandoning Kermit.?
When he died it was unthinkable for many to imagine someone else taking on the role.But Whitmire took up the job, and became the only Kermit many of today?
