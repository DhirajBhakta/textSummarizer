Dubai will now have a robot patrolling the city streets as a police officer.The world's first operational robot police officer was officially inducted into the Dubai police force at the 4th Gulf Information Security Expo and Conference (GISEC) on Sunday.This robot -- or as it is know, the robocop -- is around 5-foot tall and weighs a 100kg. 
It can not only identify hand gestures from a distance of up to 1.5 metres, but can also detect people's emotions and facial expressions.In other words, the robocop can tell when you are happy, sad or even smiling, and will itself respond accordingly "to put people at ease".The robocop comes with other special features, such as its facial recognition software with which it can identify offenders.
