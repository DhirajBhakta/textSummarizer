The Delhi government has sanctioned Rs 54.84 crore for the construction of a skywalk at ITO. 
Because of the new Metro station at ITO, the crowd at the junction has gone up, said a PWD official.Currently, there is only one foot overbridge on the Vikas Marg in front of the ITO building. 
Recently, the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) constructed a subway, allowing pedestrians to cross Vikas Marg, BSZ Marg and the DDU Marg.
