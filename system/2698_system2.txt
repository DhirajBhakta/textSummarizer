She said, "I don't know why I was so against joining the social media. 
My mind was blocked completely, I wasn't even ready for a discussion. 
But now that I have come on it, I really like it. 
I really enjoy it."
"I really wish I had because I would have done much more. 
I would have had that much time to grow my base of people who interact with me. 
I have things to say, and then there are these abstract pictures and thoughts in my head. 
And I want to have an audience to share them with. 
After Jagga Jasoos, I had no film, and then everything kind of happened on its own," she added.
