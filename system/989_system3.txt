Bollywood actor Nawazuddin Siddiquis recent cryptic tweet created a furore as it hinted at him being discriminated in the film industry on the basis of his skin colour.He had tweeted, Thank U 4 making me realise dat I cannot b paired along wid d fair & handsome bcz I m dark & not good looking, but I never focus on that. 
But that person belongs to the industry, whose reply I have given. 
So these things are there everywhere, not just in Bollywood.His co-star Tiger Shroff, while talking on the same issue, said, Nawaz sir has a huge fan following and wherever I go with him, female fans are more eager to meet the Gangs Of Wasseypur star as they are crazy about him.
