(sic)?
I tweeted what I felt. 
Someone had said something to me and that tweet is a reply to that,? 
he said during a press conference of Munna Michael. 
When asked if the whole industry is like that, the Raees star said, ?
No, the industry is not like that. 
But that person belongs to the industry, whose reply I have given. 
I have been hearing that since childhood but still I am still here and the industry has accepted me. 
When I was young and I expressed my desire to become an actor, people around me said, ?
Have you looked at yourself??. 
Even later, when I used to go to offices in Mumbai, everyone used to tell me that I don?
t look like an actor. 
So these things are there everywhere, not just in Bollywood.?
His co-star Tiger Shroff, while talking on the same issue, said, ?
Nawaz sir has a huge fan following and wherever I go with him, female fans are more eager to meet the ?
Gangs Of Wasseypur?
