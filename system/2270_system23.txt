They said the dumping activity went on even during the day. 
We informed the police when the violation was brought to our notice and we are happy they acted on it.Rakesh Coelho, OLCA secretary said, This dumping of debris has destroyed a two-acre patch at the wetland. 
The periphery of the wetland site has dense mangrove cover but the centre is a bald patch that gets good supply of brackish water, he said.
