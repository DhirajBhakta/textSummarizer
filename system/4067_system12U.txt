Mumbai, Mar 26 (PTI) Banker Uday Kotak has said the BJPs win in the recent state polls is positive for economic reforms and the government should now focus on re-activating "animal spirits" of the private sector to invest. 
"I think we just need to make sure that we are focused on growing the economy, getting the private sectors animal spirits back and that will create jobs," Kotak told PTI over the weekend.
