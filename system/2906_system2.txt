Sonam Kapoor and Anand Ahuja's relationship has been the talk of the town for a while now. 
Anil Kapoor recently talked about his relationship with his daughter's boyfriend in an interview with Pune Mirror.He said, "It is not my place to speak about Anand, that is entirely Sonam's prerogative and I have not known her to speak about her personal life. 
All I can say is that Anand and I are both private people and the bond we share is too personal for me to discuss with the media."
Sonam celebrated her birthday with Anand earlier this month, and it looked like her beau made her evening very special.
