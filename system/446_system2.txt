Maduros unpopular leftist government on Sunday promoted a remixed version of Despacito to encourage Venezuelans to vote for the Constituent Assembly, which will have powers to rewrite the national charter and supersede other institutions. 
Our call to the Constituent Assembly only seeks to unite the country ... 
Despacito! 
goes the Socialist Party-sanctioned remix of the catchy dance song, which was played during Maduros weekly televised show. 
What do you think, eh Is this video approved a grinning and clapping Maduro called out to the crowd, which roared back in approval. 
Daddy Yankee, meanwhile, posted a picture of Maduro with a big red cross over it on Instagram. 
That you illegally appropriate a song (Despacito) does not compare with the crimes you commit and have committed in Venezuela. 
Your dictatorial regime is a joke, not only for my Venezuelan brothers, but for the entire world, he said. 
With this nefarious marketing plan, you only highlight your fascist ideal. 
Critics say Maduro is trying to cement a dictatorship by pushing forward with the Constituent Assembly this Sunday. 
He says it is the only way to bring peace back to the convulsed nation.
