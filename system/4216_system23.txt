Mumbai, Mar 16 (PTI) Indrani Mukerjea, accused in the Sheena Bora murder case, today told the special CBI court here that she would oppose her estranged son Mekhails claim on Sheenas share of ancestral property. 
The Guwahati court directed that if Indrani, who is lodged in a prison here, had any objections she should submit them in person or through a lawyer. 
Her (Indranis) mother had nowhere said that in the event of Sheenas death her share will go to Mekhail, Indrani said.
