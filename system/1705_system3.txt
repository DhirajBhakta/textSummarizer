The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) is planning to postpone Class 12 board exams to March second week owing to the upcoming assembly polls in five states, sources said. 
But a final view is yet to be taken, said a source.The exams usually begin on March 1 and end in April, and results are declared in the third week of May. 
However, teachers said students shouldnt worry as CBSE usually holds the Humanities examination in the later part of April. 
As it is CBSE which conducts both examinations, they must have kept this issue in mind, said a teacher at Delhi Public School, RK Puram.There is information yet about CBSE Class 10 board exams.
