The issue is that the maintenance cost of a bus is so high that manufacturers do not want to take the onus on them, officials said.While there are 3,781 low-floor buses plying in the Capital, it is the 170 standard floor buses that are the oldest (more than 10 years old) and will be condemned in the coming months.The DTC which is one of the oldest State Transport Units (STUs) of India is also worried that if things do not move quickly form here it would be left with only 6,517 employees by 2025 out of which 5052 will be regular drivers alone.
