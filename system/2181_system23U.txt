For more than 17 years, a family of five from Goregaon (East) has been planting saplings across Aarey Milk Colony during the monsoon and caring for them till they become full-grown trees. 
They have so far planted 5,500 saplings. 
The garden has 700 trees now with 70 nectar plant species, including Jamaican spike, lemon, jathropha, pentas, exoras and many other species.
