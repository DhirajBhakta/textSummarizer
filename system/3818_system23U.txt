If the picture of Salman Khan and Katrina Kaif on the sets of Tiger Zinda Hai raised the temperature, then Ali Abbas Zafar promises more hotness in his upcoming film. 
At least, this viral picture suggests so. 
Salman, who will reprise his role in Ek Tha Tiger sequel, was seen bonding with Austrian actor and Playboy model Ronja Forcher during the shooting of Tiger Zinda Hai in Austria.
