I've seen the youngest of children remind us through their actions and through their generosity of our obligations to care for refugees, or work for peace, and, above all, to look out for each other.I've seen you, the American people, in all your decency, determination, good humor, and kindness. 
And in your daily acts of citizenship, I've seen our future unfolding.All of us, regardless of party, should throw ourselves into that work - the joyous work of citizenship.
