scrapped New Delhi, May 4 (PTI) An RSS affiliate today sought the sports ministrys intervention for annulment of BCCIs contract with Chinese firm Oppo for sponsoring the Indian cricket team. 
"Money cannot be more important than national pride and welfare of our own citizens and industry and therefore we urge you to interfere in the matter and use your good offices to cancel the agreement entered into between Oppo and BCCI," the SJM said in a letter to Sports Minister Vijay Goel. 
"This would not only misguide our youth in blindly going for buying Chinese brands but would also place us in a very awkward position and our campaign is likely to get badly affected by this," SJMs national co-convener Ashwani Mahajan said in the letter. 
"Chinese goods have invaded Indian markets which is not only killing our domestic production but also has direct negative impact on employment generation efforts made by the government," Mahajan said, adding it has taken shape of an "epidemic".
