Hollywood A-lister George Clooney is fuming mad at Voici for publishing images of his twins and will sue the French entertainment magazine.Over the last week, photographers from Voici magazine scaled our fence, climbed our tree and illegally took pictures of our infants inside our home, Clooney said in a statement. 
Make no mistake, the photographers, the agency and the magazine will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.
