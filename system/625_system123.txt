After India Today reported on June 14 that Chennai Police has decided to transfer the case of money laundering against the ex-commissioner of Indian Premier League (IPL) Lalit Modi to Mumbai Police, the latter has declined to probe the matter. 
After sitting on the case for almost seven years, the Chennai Police recommended a CBI probe and transfer of case to Mumbai Police on grounds of, "territorial jurisdiction to Mumbai Police is legally sound and justified for effective and speedy investigation".But according to latest reports, Mumbai Police has returned the case to Chennai Police saying that the 'FIR was filed in Chennai'.
