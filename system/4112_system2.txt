Here is our Phillauri movie review.Phillauri Cast: Anushka Sharma, Diljit Dosanjh, Suraj Sharma, Mehreen PirzadaPhillauri Direction: Anshai LalPhillauri Rating:  (1.5/5) When the friendly spirit Shashi is asked why she is stuck with the soon-to-be-married Kanan, she says, "Pata nahi, main to yahi atki hui hoon." 
As such, the usual direction a story like this can take is one where the human(s) and the ghost(s) slowly resolve their innermost crises by being in constant proximity to each other and this is achieved by a series of good, well-written scenes.Now, Kanan's crisis is that 1. he is unsure of getting married and 2. there is a ghost living with him. 
In friendly-ghost films like these, it is the way the human and the ghost play off each other and the weird situations they create is what makes these films worth watching.But Kanan-Shashi's parts are punctuated by an elaborate backstory that is just dull and Diljit Dosanjh is a decent performer, sure, but he is not a big enough Khan to make mediocre writing worthwhile.
