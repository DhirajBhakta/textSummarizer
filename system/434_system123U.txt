After taking the oath of office as the 14th President of India, Ram Nath Kovind is now the first citizen of the country. 
The vice-president, currently Hamid Ansari, is the second citizen of India as per the Order of Precedence of the Republic of India. 
Once the vice-presidential election is over in August, the second citizen will be either former Union minister M Venkaiah Naidu or Mahatma Gandhi's grandson Gopalkrishna Gandhi.
