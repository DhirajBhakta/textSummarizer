The move would allow women and children to access washrooms even in five-star hotels of South Delhi, Goel said, adding that the decision was taken on a suggestion from lieutenant governor Anil Baijal.We want the hotels and restaurants to take this directive in the right spirit. 
Security concerns, coupled with the fact that some restaurants and bars dont allow single males, made us keep men out for now, Amlani said.A senior SDMC official said hotel associations were also apprehensive of allowing men because they are more likely to enter drunk.
