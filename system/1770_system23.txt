The Australian Cricket Board (ACB), which had kept the information secret for years, finally admitted that two of their cricketing icons Mark Waugh and Shane Warne had been paid to provide information to an Indian bookmaker during the Singer Cup in Sri Lanka in 1994. 
Warne and Waugh, both inveterate gamblers, took the bait for $5,000 and $6,000 (Rs 2.55 lakh) - less than their fines of $8,000 (Rs 3.4 lakh) and $10,000 (Rs 4.25 lakh) - unaware that they were being softened up for a later sting.
