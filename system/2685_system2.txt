In the email  with the subject Doing the right thing, sent at 2.29am  Musk lamented the scrutiny that his company faces, saying, The list of companies that want to kill Tesla is so long, Ive lost track.As as a result, he continued, employees must work harder and faster than competitors, adding they cant be a jerk in the process.Musk did not name Vandermeyden, but went on to offer what seemed to be a thinly veiled attack on her lawsuit: If you are part of a less represented group, you dont get a free pass on being a jerk yourself. 
It hurts because there are going to be some people who believe that.She also noted that she has consistently received positive performance evaluations and called his email defamatory.Asked about the email, Tesla said in a statement: This email in fact did not reference Ms Vandermeyden or her case.Vandermeyden said she wished that Musk would consider that dissent isnt disloyalty and that her love of Tesla drove her to advocate for better working conditions.
