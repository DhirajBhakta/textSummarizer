Shiv Sena MP Ravindra Gaikwad, who was temporarily banned from domestic flight travel after he assaulted a 60-year old Air India staffer, has now called for guidelines to control the behaviour of airline staff.Earlier on Friday, the civil aviation ministry announced a new set of guidelines for dealing with unruly passengers on flights. 
Sometimes even passengers have to suffer due to the behaviour of airline staff, that also should have some strict guidelines...Forget us, we usually fly on domestic routes, but you can ask passengers who travel long distance," he added.THREE LEVELS OF OFFENCESThe proposed draft has three levels of offences that can lead to a person being listed on the No Fly List.The first level includes disruptive behaviour such as physical gestures, punishable by suspension for three months. 
The penalty for such offences would be suspension for two years or more.The new guidelines also have a penalty structure through which an unruly passenger can be fined up to Rs 5 lakh for delaying a flight by an hour, Rs 10 lakh for delays longer than an hour, and Rs 15 lakh for delays longer than two hours.
