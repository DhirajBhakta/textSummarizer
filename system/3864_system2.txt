We have identified two plots near Okhla and Janakpuri (west) metro stations. 
We will construct 460 flats in Janakpuri and 90 in Okhla. 
The flats will be allotted on the basis of a draw and people can apply as soon as we open the scheme. 
The flats will be delivered within two years, said a senior DMRC official. 
This is the first time that DMRC is constructing flats for public. 
Until now, it had constructed residential apartments only for its staff in Shastri Park, Yamuna Bank and Pushp Vihar.  
The applicant will need to pay a booking amount and if his/her name does not appear in the final list, the money will be refunded. 
This will enable high rises to come up in these areas and make for denser colonies.
