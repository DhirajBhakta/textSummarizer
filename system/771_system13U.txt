The Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) on Friday slammed the government for poor implementation of crop insurance schemes in 2011-16, saying the funds were released to private insurers without verification.Both the central and state government had incurred an expenditure of Rs 32,606.65 crore towards payment of premium subsidy and claim liabilities in the said period. 
These schemes, however, now have been replaced with new Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojan (PMFBY) from 2016 kharif season.During 2011-16, AIC had released Rs 36,222.79 crore as premium subsidy to 10 private insurance companies without compliance with any of the guidelines..., the auditor said in the report placed before Parliament.It added that the AIC failed to exercise due diligence by verification of claims by private insurance companies before releasing the funds to them.
