A bitter stand-off between a local community and miners has emerged after a significant seam of gold was found on protected conservation land in New Zealands North Island.Last week New Talisman Gold Mines reported they had found a large vein of gold in the Karangahake Gorge in the North Island; 8,500kg of highest quality gold which put it in the top five percent of deposits worldwide when ranked on grade, according to the company.The find is believed to be worth tens of millions of New Zealand dollars.Talismans general manager of operations Wayne Chowles said the company planned to begin extracting small amounts of gold early next year, but locals in opposition to the scheme have sprung into action, saying the mining project threatens the peace and harmony of their sacred mountain and community.The Karangahake Gorge lies on protected department of conservation land in the Coromandel peninsula and is a popular destination for tourists and locals alike.
