After DIG Prisons D Roopa alleged that AIADMK chief Sasikala paid Rs 2 crore bribe to Bengaluru jail officials in return for special treatment, nearly 40 prisoners from the Bengaluru Central Jail have been transferred to Bellary jail.According to sources, these prisoners were believed to be helping Sasikala.Earlier, Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah ordered a probe into the report filed by D Roopa in which she alleged that Sasikala gave Rs 1 crore bribe to Karnataka Director General of Prisons (DGP) Satyanarayana Rao for an exclusive kitchen inside her prison.The Home Department also set up a one-man inquiry committee after Chief Minister Siddaramaiah ordered a probe into the report. 
The DIG Prison's report alleged that another Rs 1 crore bribe was distributed among officials, including the warden of the Bengaluru Central Jail. 
Sasikala, 59, is in the Parpanna Agrahara Central Jail since February 15 to serve a four-year sentence after she was found guilty and convicted by a trial court in Bengaluru in September 2014 in the two decade-old illegal wealth case of former Tamil Nadu Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa. 
Though the Karnataka High Court had acquitted her, the Supreme Court on February 14, 2017 upheld the conviction and sentencing.? DGP Rao, however, called the charges baseless and said the DIG who levelled the allegations was "unaware" of the rules. 
D Roopa alleged that Sasikala had an exclusive kitchen inside the Bengaluru prison and her food was cooked by special chefs.? The Karnataka government has also issued a notice to DIG D Roopa for allegedly sharing her report with the media.? "I have submitted the report to Director General of Police R K Dutta and have not shared or shown it to anyone.
