The bill was tabled in the Lower House by Animal Husbandry Minister Mahadev Jankar.Last week, the state Cabinet had decided to appoint a cabinet sub-committee to study the draft of the amendment bill to revoke the ban on bullock-cart racing.The reasoning given to the amendment is to follow and promote tradition and culture and ensure preservation of native breeds of bulls as also their purity, safety, security and well-being.The amendment will be applicable to bullock cart races in the state which are known by different names in different parts like "Chakadi", "Bailgada Sharyat" , or "Shankar Paat" . 
Bullock cart races will be allowed in any district where it is being traditionally held at such places.
