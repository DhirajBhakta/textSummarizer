A towering man with a vision for the future of the army and personal development of its personnel - Brigade Commander and double Shaurya Chakra awardee Brigadier Bhalla, a man of great grace and full of laughter, no doubt a man who commands respect and love of his troops - The Deputy Commander Colonel Pandey for his empathetic and resourceful company - Colonel Vikrant Sharma, a man of great organisational skills and the most disarming smile - and last but not the least by any standards the officer's mess Haviladar "the boxer" who's hospitality I shall never forget.
