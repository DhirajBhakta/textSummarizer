Mumbai, May 27 (PTI) Filmmaker Ram Gopal Varma says contrary to the popular perception, underworld never invested money into Bollywood and there was never really a "nexus" between them. 
The director, known for making several gangster-dramas like "Satya", "Company" and "D", says he has never been at the receiving end of the underworld because of his films. 
Asked whether it is hard not to glorify someone, especially when one is making a film on gangsters, Varma says, "Gabbar Singh is the most loved character, but I dont know if a single person got inspired to become a dacoit in Chambal valley after seeing Sholay.
