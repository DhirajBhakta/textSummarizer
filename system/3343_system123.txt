Australia's cricket board has warned players will not be given alternative contracts if they fail to agree to a new collective bargaining agreement in an escalation of a protracted and increasingly bitter pay dispute.Australia's professional cricketers rejected a pay offer from the sport's governing body last month, saying the proposal was "a win for cricket administrators but a loss for cricket".CA released their proposal in March, offering large salary increases, particularly for women, but breaking with the 20-year model of a fixed percentage of revenue from the game going to the cricketers.James Sutherland told the players' association that they needed to meet terms with CA or players would go unpaid when the existing collective bargaining agreement expires on June 30."
