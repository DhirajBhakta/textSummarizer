Winning two is already pretty crazy and plenty good enough for me, Federer told in an interview with CNN.The Swiss legend, however, said that he would try and give his best shot in the final major of the season.Ill definitely try and get myself organised, prepared and ready so that Ill have the best chance to do well at the US Open, he added.Earlier this month, Federer outclassed Marin Cilic of Croatia 6-3, 6-1, 6-4 in his 11th final at the All England Club.
