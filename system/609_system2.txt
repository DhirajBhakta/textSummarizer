We have decided to convert the heritage building of Gole Market into a New Delhi museum. 
						Besides photographs and other display material such as paintings, statues and literature based on the socio-economic, cultural and political aspects and conditions of pre- and post-independent period of the country, the contribution and sacrifice of freedom fighters would be also depicted in the museum. 
It would help to sensitize teachers, adults, youth and woman organizations through interacting discussions on the government programmes and activities for the promotion and better understanding of its heritage and its agenda for national growth and development and general emancipation, he added.
