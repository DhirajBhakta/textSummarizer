Then came, Dedh Ishqiya and last year, the Shahid Kapoor, Alia Bhatt and Kareena Kapoor Khan-starrer drug-themed Udta Punjab.His next film co-written by NH10 and Udta Punjab writer Sudip Sharma is going to be based on the dacoits of Chambal and is set during the '70s. 
Everyone has heard horror stories about the dacoits of Chambal but I have realised the reality is quite different from what Hindi films portray.
