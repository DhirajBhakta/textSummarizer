This will be a soft launch of sorts in August, after which we can proceed towards making CP a no-vehicle zone in phases based on the response, the official told HT.We will study traffic flow, parking issues and experiences of pedestrians and shop owners, he said, adding that based on the feedback, they will decide whether to make the arrangement permanent.The three-month trial for a car-free Connaught Place, which the NDMC had planned in February, was put off after opposition from traders at the popular shopping hub.Traders have threatened to protest again, saying Saturdays, Sundays, and even Mondays were peak days of business for them.We are absolutely against it.
