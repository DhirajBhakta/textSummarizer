The court today granted an anticipatory bail to Kumar.The court heard Kumar's anticipatory bail application in the cases of sexual harassment filed against him by a former employee and another woman who alleged that he behaved inappropriately when she went to his office.Arunabh's lawyer Abad Ponda told the court that not only were these cases falsely registered against him but there were no merits in the cases which were registered more than an year after the alleged incidents. 
The prosecution also told the court that Kumar had been interrogated at least eight times since the cases were registered.Considering that Arunabh has been cooperating with police in their investigation, the court granted the anticipatory bail. 
A fortnight ago the Mumbai Police had registered two cases against Arunabh Kumar after women came forward and accused the TVF CEO of sexual harassment.The first case was filed on March 29, while the second was filed the following day.
