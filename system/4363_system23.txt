In a shameful incident right under the nose of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, few strongmen from the Dalit community passed a diktat of tonsuring the head of a Dalit woman and her brother -in-law suspecting an illicit relation between the two. 
The two were later paraded in front of the entire village after their heads were tonsured.The Dalit woman Soni Devi with her baby and her brother-in-law Shailendra Ram were abused and their faces blackened while they were paraded in the village. 
The three women accused however are still at large and the police are looking out for them."
