The meeting which took place at the VVIP guest house, where Yogi Adityanath has been staying since assuming charge as the CM, was described as a 'courtesy call'. 
Aparna and Prateek spent about 30 minutes with the new CM.Aparna contested the recent Assembly election from Lucknow Cantt but was defeated comprehensively by BJP candidate Rita Bahuguna Joshi.This is not for the first that Aparna has been seen hobnobbing with a top BJP leader.
