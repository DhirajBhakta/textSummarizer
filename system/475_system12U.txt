Broken benches, damaged floodlights and scratched plaques  this was the sight of Rezang La war memorial in Palam Vihar on Tuesday morning when members of the Martyrs family welfare foundation visited the site to plan celebrations ahead of the Kargil Vijay Diwas on Wednesday.We were shocked to look at the site. 
This was not one persons or one associations property, it is the countrys heritage, said Col (retd) Mahavir Yadav, a member of the association.Rao, who served in the Indian Army for years and was a part of Kargil war, said that it could not be work of just two-three men, but a group who had come solely with the purpose of destroying the great memorial.He alleged that the vandalism was a result of a complaint he had filed at the chief ministers window on Monday against a wine shop in the vicinity of the memorial.
