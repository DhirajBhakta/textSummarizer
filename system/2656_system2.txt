In the wake of escalating tension along the India-China border, Delhi BJP president Manoj Tiwari on Friday appealed to Delhi's traders to refuse selling Chinese products as that will be a big blow to the Chinese economy.He said, notwithstanding China's military, its economy was largely dependent on Indian markets and traders here should boycott selling their products to teach the neighbour a lesson.
