The Delhi Police, however, said they will begin internal probe in the matter and challenge the order in high court if the charges were found to be false.Additional sessions judge Vinod Yadav, on Monday, passed the order after the 13-year-old girl told the court that she was sexually assaulted by the woman investigating officer (IO) of the case and she had lodged a complaint with the police against her but no action was taken.The court also dismissed the third bail plea of the teacher of a government school, facing prosecution in the case, saying there was no change in circumstances.Today, separate directions have been given for lodging of FIR against the IO in this case for having committed penetrative sexual assault upon the child victim and creating false evidence.Needless to say, false evidence was being created by the IO solely to accord benefit thereof to the applicant/accused Manoj Rathi (teacher).
