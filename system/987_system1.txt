By Lalit K Jha Washington, Jul 18 (PTI) The Islamic State Khorasan (ISIS-K) has lost its hold in Afghanistan, days after the terror groups head Abu Sayed, was killed by US troops in an airstrike, the Pentagon has said. 
During an off-camera news conference yesterday, Davis said the killing of ISIS-K leader Abu Sayed in a drone strike last week disrupted it?
"His death will further disrupt the groups plans to expand its operations in Afghanistan," he said, adding that this is the third time in the past year that US forces in Afghanistan have killed a sitting leader of ISIS-K.
