Justice Mahesh Chandra Sharma of Rajasthan High Court has set social media on fire saying peacock is India's national bird because the bird does not have sex to reproduce. 
Justice Sharma said that the peahen gets pregnant drinking the tears of the peacock.? We know cow is a holy animal in India. 
There have been many discussions on Quora about the piousness of peacock even before Justice Sharma triggered a conversation about how peacocks mate, and people have been sensible enough to understand that impregnation through the intake of tear drops is nothing but a myth.
