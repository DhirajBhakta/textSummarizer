The state is in talks with a Holland-based company to set up smogfree towers in Gurugram and Faridabad, the two districts adjoining the national Capital that contribute to nearly one-fifth of air pollution in the region. 
A smog-free tower is a sevenmetre-high air purifier, the largest in the world, which takes in polluted air particles and expels cleaner air. 
Each air purifier tower, which contains three small in-built purifiers and the outer shell, is effective within the radius of 300 metre to 7 km, claims its manufacturer company.One unit of the giant purifier costs somewhere between `1.8 and `2 crore and it takes about three months to manufacture a single unit.
