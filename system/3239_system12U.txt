"Bowlers are pretty much second-class citizens in white-ball cricket," says former New Zealand pacer Shane Bond, who feels odds are stacked heavily against them in the limited-overs format.Writing for the International Cricket Council ahead of the upcoming Champions Trophy in England starting June 1, Bond said limited-overs cricket is "a batsman's game"."
That philosophy has now gone out the window," he explained.Bond said bowlers cannot do without variety in the current scenario where every alternate game ends up being a run feast."
