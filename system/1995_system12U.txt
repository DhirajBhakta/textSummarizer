New Delhi, Dec 19 (PTI) Indiscipline on part of security force personnel must be "viewed seriously" and deserting work by disobeying orders of superior officers is an act of "gross misconduct", the Supreme Court has ruled. 
In its verdict, the apex court held that though Ali was found guilty of deserting the force for a period of five days and not improving his conduct in spite of penalties imposed on him on three earlier occasions, the penalty of dismissal from service is "excessive and harsh" and "in our view, the penalty of compulsory retirement would meet the ends of justice".
