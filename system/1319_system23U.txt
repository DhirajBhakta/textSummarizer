China's State media has urged India to take steps to enable a former Chinese soldier, who has been residing in Madhya Pradesh after being imprisoned shortly after the 1962 war, to return to China to visit his family.The story of Wang Qi, who was a Chinese army surveyor who strayed into India in January 1963 and subsequently imprisoned until 1969, has garnered increasing attention in China after a report last week by the BBC describing his life in the village of Tirodi, in MP, and his desire to return to visit his family.On Friday, the Global Times, a widely-read Party run newspaper published by the People's Daily, strongly urged India to issue relevant documents to allow Wang, who reports said is now in his eighties, to return on humanitarian grounds.
