Scores of Tamil Nadu farmers landed in the national capital on Sunday to resume their agitation for loan waiver and drought-relief package.Around 70 cultivators were, however, detained when they tried to stage a demonstration near the prime ministers residence at Lok Kalyan Marg. 
They were later taken to Parliament Street police station.Our demands were not met as promised by Tamil Nadu chief minister Edappadi Palaniswami and Union minister Pon Radhakrishnan. 
So we have decided to resume our protest for another 100 days, farmers leader P Ayyakannu said.The farmers from the southern state have been demanding a drought relief package of Rs 40,000 crore, farm loan waiver and setting up of Cauvery Management Board by the Centre.They will join an indefinite protest after their counterparts, taking part in Kisan Mukti Yatra, reach Jantar Mantar here on July 18.The group led by Ayyakannu had in March staged novel protests by holding human skulls outside the prime ministers house, stripping naked outside the presidents and drinking urine.
