The Middle East Airlines flight from Beirut was forced to make the emergency landing in Istanbuls Ataturk Airport after the argument broke out. 
Cabin crew rushed to break up the fight, but the man "violently" shoved one of them away and punched another, The Mirror reported. 
The young man seen in the video of the brawl, with a beard and dark hair, then raced over to help the air hostesses.
