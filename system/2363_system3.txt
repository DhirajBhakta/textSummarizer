						The 30-year-old actor recalled talking to his director Miguel Sapochnik that the Lord Commander of the Night?
s Watch secretly thrives when he is on a war front, according to The Hollywood Reporter. ?
I actually think secretly deep down, he?
s a bit of a psychopath, weirdly. 
He looks for violence. 
In a strange way, and I said this to (Sapochnik) during ?
Battle of the Bastards,? 
I think that in a weird way this could be Jon?
s natural home, on this battlefield, where he comes to life. 
For all of his good, he?
s a violent man,? 
says Harington.The actor adds Jon?
s character does not have much to do with happiness.?
I think happiness is a very strange term to associate with Jon. 
He has a very odd sense of what ?
happy? 
is. 
It might not be everybody else?
s ?
happy.? 
I don?
t know what happiness is for Jon,? 
he says.
