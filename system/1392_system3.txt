Jamaican Usain Bolt says it is rough losing one of his nine Olympic gold medals after relay team mate Nesta Carter was found guilty of doping at the 2008 Beijing Olympics."
It's rough that I have to give back one of my medals and I already gave it back because it was of course required by the IOC", Bolt told Reuters on Friday in his first comments since the International Olympic Committee ruling."
Carter was found in re-tests of his sample to have taken the banned stimulant methylhexaneamine, the IOC said on Wednesday, meaning the entire Jamaican relay team had to return their gold medals.The loss of the 4x100 metres medal leaves Bolt with eight Olympic golds, and he does not think the ruling tarnishes his glittering career record.And he still might have one last chance to reclaim his medal, with an appeal by Carter to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in the works, according to Jamaica Olympic Association president Mike Fennell.Bolt was non-committal about whether he would financially contribute to Carter's appeal."
