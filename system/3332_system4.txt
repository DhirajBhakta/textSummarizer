Bryson William Verdun Hayes, known as Verdun, broke the world record on Sunday, completing a tandem skydive with three generations of his family at an airfield in Honiton, Devon. 
He took to the skies with 10 members of his family at Skydive Buzz in Dunkeswell, all raising money for the Royal British Legion. 
s support for the Royal British Legion and the money raised recognises the service and sacrifice made across all generations of the British armed forces. ?
Members of the family have separate online donation pages but Hayes, who hoped to raise ?1,000, has already beaten his target and the current total on Virgin Money Giving stands at more than ?1,600.
