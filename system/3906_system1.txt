He has given innumerable hits and some great performances in a career spanning over two decades, but has never won a national award. 
But it all changed for Akshay Kumar on Friday afternoon (April 7) when he won the national award for Best Actor for Rustom. 
And his performance in 2016 film Rustom has won him his first national award. 
Actually, I am still trying to process this win, it is a mix of many emotions - surprise, happiness and, most prominently, gratitude to the jury, makers of the film, my parents and of course the beloved fans." 
Neither have I ever made a call to anyone to win an award nor have given money or done favours for it," he added.
