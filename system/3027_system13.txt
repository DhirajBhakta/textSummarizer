"A large number of traffic incidents are caused by medical conditions while driving, specifically cardiovascular events, such as myocardial infraction and myocardial ischemia," said Kayvan Najarian, from University of Michigan in the US. 
"The medical event interferes with the drivers ability to safely drive and operate the car, causing the accident," said Najarian. 
Researchers are creating a system that could be placed in the vehicle to monitor and predict an adverse cardiac event.
