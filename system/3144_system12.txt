Saying that India has been successful in facing off against the challenges posed by the Islamic State, Home Minister Rajnath Singh said on Saturday, dubbing the global terror group a failure in the country. 
Addressing a press conference on the three years of the Narendra Modi government, Singh said the security situation in the country has largely been under control. 
I can say with full responsibility that despite such a large population (of Muslims), the ISIS has not been able to set foot," Rajnath Singh said.
