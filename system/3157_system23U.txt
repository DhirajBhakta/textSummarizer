On second day of his three-day stay in Russia, Prime Minister Narendra Modi met Russian President Vladimir Putin and both the leaders agreed to strengthen ties between the two old allies. 
Apart from this, Russia also said that it was preparing to supply S-400 Triumf anti-aircraft missile systems to India, a move which would provide India a strategic edge over neighbouring countries Pakistan and China.
