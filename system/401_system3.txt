Another woman in Shivaji Nagar went to her daughters school to pick her up and when she returned she found her house robbed.For the past one year, the Mumbai and Thane police were getting regular complaints of house break-ins within minutes by unknown thieves.After months of investigation and rounding up several history sheeters, the Tilak Nagar police found just one witness. 
We only knew that they drove a Swift Desire, said inspector Santosh Kamble from Tilak Nagar police station.A team of three officers were then assigned to investigate the series of house break-ins. 
The Meerut gang only chose two- or three-storey  houses for a quick escape, said Shahaji Umap, deputy commissioner of police (zone VI).
