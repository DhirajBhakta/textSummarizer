New Delhi, Jan 10 (PTI)Foreign lender Citi India today launched voice biometrics authentication that would replace the current practice of interactive voice response (IVR) for its customers. 
The new technology allows clients to use their voiceprints for authentication rather than having to remember multiple PINs or respond to questions used for verifying their identities, Citi South Asia Head (Operations & Technology) Anand Chopra said. 
The voice biometrics authentication capability uses voiceprint, similar to fingerprint, which is unique for each person. 
The new authentication solution is fast, secure and convenient as verification is completed automatically within 15 seconds while clients speak to the (bank) official when they call CitiPhone Banking, the 24-hour hotline service.
