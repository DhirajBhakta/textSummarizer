A 10-year boy has accidentally discovered a rare, mostly intact 1.2 million year-old skull of stegomastodon - a prehistoric ancestor of elephants - while hiking in the Las Cruces desert in the US.?
I was running farther up and I tripped on part of the tusk,? 
said Jude Sparks, who had been hiking in the desert with his parents.?
My face landed next to the bottom jaw. 
I looked farther up and there was another tusk,? 
said Sparks.The Sparks family contacted Peter Houde, a professor at the New Mexico State University (NMSU) in the US.?
A stegomastodon would look to any of us like an elephant,? 
said Houde.?
For the several types of elephants that we have in the area, this is probably one of the more common of them. 
But they?
re still very rare. 
This may be only the second complete skull found in New Mexico,? 
While the skull may appear to be strong, it is quite delicate.?
The upper part of the skull is deceiving. 
It?
s mostly hollow and the surface of the skull is eggshell thin,? 
Houde said.?
An extremely large skull would be very heavy for the animal if it didn?
t have air inside it to lighten it up just like our own sinuses,? 
he said.?
That makes the thing extremely fragile and the only thing holding it together is the sediment surrounding it,?
