From Sajjad Hussain Islamabad, Jan 5 (PTI) Claiming that Kashmir was an "integral part" of Pakistan, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif today needled India yet again by praising slain Hizbul Mujahideen militant Burhan Wani as a "vibrant and charismatic leader". 
He claimed the "martyrdom of vibrant and charismatic Kashmiri leader Burhan Wani has given a new turn to the Kashmiri movement". 
He said Pakistan will continue to extend moral, political and diplomatic support to the Kashmiri people in their indigenous struggle and continue to shake the conscience of the international community for their rights.
