By Aditi Khanna London, Jun 28 (PTI) A secondary school in north-west England has become the first in the UK to offer hijabs or headscarves worn by Muslims as part of the uniform for pupils. 
However, the move has come under fire from some Muslim parents and pupils, who feel the uniform hijabs are uncomfortable and not modest enough. 
It is very tight and in some cases too short as some of the girls have long hair and so it defeats the object to wear it," the petition reads.
