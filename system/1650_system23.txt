Model-turned actor Arjun Rampal and Bollywood star Jackie Shroff could be the star campaigners for the Bhartiya Janata Party ahead of the Uttar Pradesh assembly election. 
Speculation regarding this started emerging after the duo reached the BJP's headquarters in New Delhi early this morning and held meetings with party officials. 
When asked if he would be joining the party as a politician, the actor said that he hadn't decided on that yet.
