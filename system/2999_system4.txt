The government is planning to roll out daily price revision of CNG similar to what the oil companies have been doing to decide on the prices of petrol, diesel. 
Ltd (HPCL), which own more than 95 per cent of the nearly 58,000 petrol pumps in the country, launched a pilot for daily price revision in five select cities last and plan to gradually extend it to other parts of the country.While petrol price was freed from the control of the government in June 2010, diesel rates were deregulated in October 2014.Technically, oil companies have freedom to revise rates but often they have been guided by political considerations.
