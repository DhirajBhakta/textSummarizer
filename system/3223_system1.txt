This picture of Shah Rukh Khan's son Aryan Khan with Sara Ali Khan makes us want to see them on 70mm ASAP. 
Sara, who is set to make her Bollywood debut under KJo's Dharma Productions, had the company of Aryan and Shah Rukh at the party. 
?And seeing Aryan and Sara in one frame has upped our expectations of them sharing the screen space some time in near future. 
Earlier there were rumours that Sara will make her Bollywood debut with Aryan.
