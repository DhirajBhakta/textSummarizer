This picture of Shah Rukh Khan's son Aryan Khan with Sara Ali Khan makes us want to see them on 70mm ASAP. 
Sara, who is set to make her Bollywood debut under KJo's Dharma Productions, had the company of Aryan and Shah Rukh at the party. 
While Sara has often been spotted with other star kids, it is for the first time that a picture of her with Aryan has surfaced on social media. 
With SRK in the picture too, it seems King Khan managed to have broken the ice between Aryan and Sara. 
?And seeing Aryan and Sara in one frame has upped our expectations of them sharing the screen space some time in near future.
