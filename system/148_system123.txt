Union minister for transport and shipping Nitin Gadkari has demanded that the Maharashtra government provide special facilities to those detained during the Emergency under the Maintenance of Internal Security Act (MISA). 
The MISA detainees onSunday held a convention under the banner of Satyagrahi Sangh in Nagpur after meeting Gadkari at his Mahal residence. 
The group, led by the Sanghs vice-president Sacchidanand Upasane, national secretary Komal Chheda and Maharashtra unit chief Jayprakash Pande insisted that the detainees be treated as freedom fighters and be given all facilities available to a freedom fighter in the country.
