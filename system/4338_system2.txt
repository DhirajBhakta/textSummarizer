A study by TRAFFIC, an arm of World Wildlife Fund (WWF), recently found that at least three systems of traditional medicine in India - Siddha, Ayurveda and Unani - prescribe peacock feather and other parts in various potions.The practice is being followed by quacks and hospitals, including those funded by the ministry of AYUSH, in states like Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Delhi Gujarat and Rajasthan.The Indian blue peafowl (Pavo Cristatus) has considerably reduced in numbers over the years thanks to destruction of their habitats by farmers protecting their crops and poachers.
