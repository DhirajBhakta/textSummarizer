Pakistans supreme court has begun hearings that will decide the future of the prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, who is fighting for his job and contesting a damning corruption report by an investigative panel. 
Sharif, 67, has rejected demands by opposition parties to resign, warning his replacement would destabilise the country and imperil hard-won economic gains since his poll victory in 2013.It hurts that despite all of our hard work, attempts are afoot once again to push the country back, Sharif told a meeting of his ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) party at the weekend.In April Sharif narrowly escaped disqualification after the supreme court ruled there was insufficient evidence to remove him  by a 2-3 split  over documents released by the Panama Papers leak into offshore wealth. 
Sharifs legal team and the opposition will be given a chance to contest the JIT findings and Sharif is also expected to be summoned to appear before the court in coming days or weeks. 
Opposition politicians say Sharif is concocting claims of conspiracy to save his skin and argue that if he really wanted to protect democracy he should step down.
