After Kapil Mishra submitted 'documents' to the ACB to back his allegations, highly-placed sources in the agency said all the papers submitted by him are useless.A senior ACB official said, "Mishra had submitted a summary drafted by him about the tanker scam, resubmitted documents he had earlier submitted and enclosed a cover letter with these two documents. 
Mishra, who had earlier 'briefed' L-G Anil Baijal about the tanker scam, said on Monday that he had shared all evidence related to the same with ACB. 
I also told them how Kejriwal, along with two of his aides, interfered in the tanker scam probe. 
The government also tried to shield Sheila Dikshit time and again," he told reporters after the meeting.Also Read:Kapil Mishra submits proof against Arvind Kejriwal, aides on water tanker scam, seeks time with CBI
