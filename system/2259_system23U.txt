I feel talent does count, but for someone to observe your talent, you have to do one film and thats where luck comes in. 
I come from FTII (Film and Television Institute of India) Pune, and we were 11 boys and 10 girls, and I thought that out those 11 boys, 10 were better than me. 
The luck factor is so strong for you to become an actor, and then comes the talent.Talking about how the approach in the film industry has changed over the years, Shakti Kapoor says that things are highly professional now compared to the earlier times.
