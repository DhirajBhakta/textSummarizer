Bandras Rizvi Education Society, which manages seven institutes including schools and colleges, recently implemented the first phase of digital transformation of its education and administration system. 
The institutes now have technology-driven teaching interface in all classrooms, bio-metric entry for students, paperless admissions and mobile apps for better teacher-parent interaction. 
The education society also plans to introduce online assessment of all examinations soon.Paperless admissions have not only reduced the work of our staff but have also made the process very transparent for everybody.
