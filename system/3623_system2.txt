A scientific report prepared by Art of Living claimed that any accidental damage to the ecology of the Yamuna floodplains caused by the Art of Livings cultural event in 2016 has already been restored by nature.This contradicts the earlier findings by the National Green Tribunal-appointed seven-member expert committee, which claimed that it would take at least 10 years and Rs42 crore to fix the physical and biological damages caused to the rivers floodplains by the event.If at all any such accidental damage would have taken place during the event, in all probability they have already been reversed by natural processes.
