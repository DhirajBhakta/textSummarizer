Kerala is among the few places in India that place no restrictions on the consumption of cow meat.While most other BJP-led governments have been unequivocal in their support to measures that ban the sale and consumption of cow meat, one of the party's candidates in Kerala is making headlines for luring voters with the promise of "good beef" if elected.
