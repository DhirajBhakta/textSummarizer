Reliance Jio beat Airtel, Vodafone and others, becoming the fastest among all 4G service providers in India in December 2016, according to data released by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India. 
TRAI's MySpeed portal had previously in October revealed that Reliance Jio was the slowest 4G service provider in India.TRAI's MySpeed online portal, unlike its Android and iOS app, doesn't test the speed of an individual connection. 
It, instead, shows you the data of tests conducted across the country.In order to check Jio's speed performance you will need to select 'Jio' as an operator, 4G as technology, and then compare the network with other (all) operators. 
The resulting graph, currently, shows Jio as having the highest average 4G download speed at 9.9Mbps with Airtel at second with 5.8Mbps. 
The Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries Limited subsidiary recently announced the Jio Happy New Year Offer for all existing and new users that "extends free voice, data, video call, SMS and Jio apps till March 31, 2017." 
Customers who buy Jio SIM cards December 4, 2016 onwards will be part of the Happy New Year Offer, while existing users who signed up for Jio Welcome Offer will automatically be moved to the new offer effective from 1st January 2017," the company said.The earlier data limit of 4GB was brought down to 1GB after Jio announced the Happy New Year Offer.
