A model from Nepal, Anjali Lama has crystal clear skin. 
Lama is a transgender; the first from the 'other' category to walk at the Lakme Fashion Week. 
"I have heard he says that he can change gay people to straight," says Lama, referring to Ramdev Baba. 
Lama has all the attributes to pass off for a top notch ramp model. 
If anything, it's only the voice that could give her away.
