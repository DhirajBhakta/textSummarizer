The Directorate of Education (DOE) has warned of action if school on government land starts the nursery admission process from January 2 next year. 
The order applies to 285 schools such as  Delhi Public School, Vasant Kunj, Vasant Valley and Apeejay. 
The government had on December 19 issued a circular saying it will release a separate set of  guidelines and schedule for these 285 schools.  
For the remaining 1,400 schools, the nursery admission process will begin January 2. ?
It may lead to a situation where two parallel schedules will be running, and it will cause a lot of inconvenience to parents. 
The same parent will have to follow the schedule of schools build on DDA land and those not built on DDA land,?
