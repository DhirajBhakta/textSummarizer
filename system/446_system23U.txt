Maduros unpopular leftist government on Sunday promoted a remixed version of Despacito to encourage Venezuelans to vote for the Constituent Assembly, which will have powers to rewrite the national charter and supersede other institutions. 
Our call to the Constituent Assembly only seeks to unite the country ... 
Despacito! 
goes the Socialist Party-sanctioned remix of the catchy dance song, which was played during Maduros weekly televised show.
