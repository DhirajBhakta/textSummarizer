Riese is a German water expert, and believes that water should be treated the same way as wine. 
So, instead of a wine sommelier (a steward or expert trained in wine services), Riese is actually a water sommelier. 
What makes his taste buds tingle is nothing less than H2O, which might come in differently-shaped bottles, and look clear and pure, but it's actually nothing of the kind.Not many people know that bottled water or mineral water is actually graded according to their TDS level. 
What this essentially means is that there is no bottled water that is pure (though it might look like it). 
A water sommelier is just trained to identify these differences.Also read: Someone deep fried water successfully, just so you could have water pakorasAll you need to be good at this job is an unquenchable thirst for water. 
Riese is the only one who holds the title of water sommelier in the USA, where he moved from Germany in 2012. 
But if the water sommeliers like Riese are to be believed, it has a lot to do with smell and sight as well as taste.
