 The city could soon get its second underground Metro line after the Colaba-Bandra-SEEPZ corridor. 
The 8-km extension will pass through the Mumbai Port Trust (MbPT) on the eastern waterfront. 
The extension is being planned to provide connectivity up to south Mumbai via port land, which is going to be developed as a second Marine Drive by MbPT.The south Mumbai extension will be partially underground. 
The corridor will be taken underground wherever we cant make it elevated. 
A detailed report is expected in September, said Pravin Darade, additional metropolitan commissioner, MMRDA.Senior MbPT officials are keen on an underground corridor for the stretch that passes through its land. 
MbPT has conveyed to the MMRDA that it would like an underground line, but the final decision will be taken once the report is out, said a senior official.Officials added MbPT will share the project cost as the extension would help them get footfalls when port trust land is developed commercially. 
According to officials, the per km cost for the elevated corridor is estimated to be Rs300 crore and Rs750 crore for the underground portion.With the extension of the Metro 4, there would be two Metro lines operating in south Mumbai.
