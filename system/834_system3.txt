Donald Trump has decided to halt the CIAs covert programme to equip and train moderate rebels fighting Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, in a move likely to be welcomed by Russias Vladimir Putin.The CIA programme began in 2013 as part of Barack Obamas support for the overthrow of Assad but met with little success, two officials told Reuters. 
We are really cutting them off at the neck.A separate effort by the US military effort to train, arm and support other Syrian rebel groups with air strikes and other actions will continue.Trump, who in April launched a cruise missile attack on Syria in response to Assads use of chemical weapons, is under scrutiny by Congress and a special counsel investigating Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and whether his associates colluded.On Wednesday Sanders played down the controversy over a second, undisclosed meeting that Trump held with Putin at a dinner during the G20 summit.I think that once again, the Russia fever has caught up with the media and everybody ran out and tried to create a story that simply didnt exist, she told reporters. 
I think it would be incredibly awkward for them to all be at a dinner and not speak with each other.Asked if the decision to end the CIA programme came up during the dinner conversation, the deputy press secretary replied: Not that Im aware of.
