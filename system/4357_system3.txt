New Delhi, Mar 5 (PTI) Capital markets watchdog SEBI may be among Indias most powerful regulators today but there was a time when people used to introduce its former chief U K Sinha as Chairman of SBI -- a similar sounding acronym but of State Bank of India. ? ? "At the start of my tenure at SEBI, people would introduce me as the chairperson of SBI, the State Bank of India (the countrys largest bank with a far flung branch network). 
According to the study, Sinha was reflecting on his past five years as the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) when he made these remarks. ? ? "It was February 2016 and he had just been appointed by the Government of India to a second term as the Chairman of SEBI," it noted. 
While SEBI as a regulator has made significant strides over the past decade, it was during Sinhas tenure that its powers increased manifold including for bringing to book entities guilty of insider trading and fraudulent investment activities such as illicit collective investment schemes.
