Malana is an isolated village in the Parvati Valley and its reclusive inhabitants are said to be descendants of soldiers of Alexanders army.A few months back, the village had banned photography because villagers felt that visitors clicking pictures were portraying Malana as a hub of narco-tourism. 
People of this village have their own culture and beliefs, said Mahila Mandal pradhan Ram Kali, adding that they have been struggling to shed this cannabis tag.Vivek Mohan, winner of a national award for his critically acclaimed documentary on Malana, said, Malana managed to preserve its culture due to two factors: devotion to Devta Jamlu and its geographical isolation.
