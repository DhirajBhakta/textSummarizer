It was only recently that the news of Salman Khan doing a cameo in Aanand L Rai's next with Shah Rukh Khan started doing the rounds. 
After SRK agreed to make a special appearance in Salman's Tubelight, the Bajrangi Bhaijaan actor decided to return the favour by agreeing to be a part of a dance sequence in the yet-to-be-titled film. 
And the 51-year-old actor has already begun shooting for the part with friend Shah Rukh Khan.
