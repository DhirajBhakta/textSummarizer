A list of do's and don'ts was released by a Mumbai college recently and apart from shocking everyone, it has invited mockery at a large scale.Government Polytechnic College in Bandra has finally found a way to avoid eve-teasing by separating the seating areas of girls and boys in the canteen area and slapping a dress code on the girls studying in the college. 
According to the college administration, girls should dress up in 'suitable' clothes as it will help the girls to "not think like men" and "lose the urge to reproduce at later stage in life".
