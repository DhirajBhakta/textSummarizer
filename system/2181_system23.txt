For more than 17 years, a family of five from Goregaon (East) has been planting saplings across Aarey Milk Colony during the monsoon and caring for them till they become full-grown trees. 
These are mostly plants that will attract the butterflies and help with their life cycle, he said, adding that his son Malhar has planted saplings all by himself and loves to be in the company of butterflies.Their efforts come at a time when Aarey is being besieged by several development projects.
