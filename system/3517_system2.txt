At a meeting here, Khattar said the tagging of 89.3 per cent of cattle in gaushalas and nandishalas (shelters for bovine animals) has been completed and Haryana would be made stray cattle-free by August 15, 2017. 
The work to rehabilitate abandoned cattle is being undertaken in a mission mode and 27,000 animals have already been accommodated in gaushalas, he said. 
A community-driven model has been adopted and the states 22 districts have been divided into two phases of 11 districts each, he said. 
The districts of Nuh, Yamunanagar and Fatehabad have already been declared stray cattle-free and the other districts would achieve this target by June 30, he said. 
Unique Identification Numbers are being assigned to each animal during tagging and cow shelter managements and veterinarians are being encouraged to maintain computerised records of these animals, he said. 
Khattar also directed officials to impose fines on people who abandon cattle after the animals become unproductive.
