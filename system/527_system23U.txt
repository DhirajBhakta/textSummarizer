The railway ministry plans to introduce its ambitious integrated ticketing system in the next three years and Mumbai will be the first city to experience it. 
Primarily a Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) project, the system will integrate all public transport  BEST buses, local trains, metros, black-and-yellow taxis and autorickshaws. 
Mumbai Rail Vikas Corporation (MRVC) and Central and Western Railway officials are currently studying different ways to sync the new software with the existing system.
