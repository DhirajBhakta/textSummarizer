PM Modi then proceeded to a cocktail reception and a working dinner with the First Family of the United States.? A red carpet welcome awaited PM Modi on Monday, with President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump waiting to greet him at the White House. 
Marine Sentries at the White House were waiting to do their ceremonial duty of opening the car doors for PM Modi. 
Both of them take two steps towards the car, holds the door, say something to each other (possibly, "at the count of three"), and tries to open the door.
Or do they open the left door anyway?
