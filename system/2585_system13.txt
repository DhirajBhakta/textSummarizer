After realising its own false allegation was ridiculous, it changed its tone to its actions to being in the name of protecting Bhutan, it added.India, who calls Bhutan an ally, said it had intervened on behalf of its neighbour, yet the true subtext is the South Asian giant wants to maintain and expand regional hegemony, it said.The Doklam area, under Chinese control, is claimed by Bhutan.But the commentary said: The Doklam area has long been recognised as Chinese sovereign territory with a clear history and legal basis, so there is absolutely no reason for India's incursion.The commentary made no mention of what India has argued and expressed concerns about.New Delhi has said it reached an agreement with Beijing in 2012 that the tri-junction boundary points between India, China and third countries will be finalised in consultation with the concerned countries.
