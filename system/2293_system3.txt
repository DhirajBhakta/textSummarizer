The project involves marking of zebra crossings, left-right turns, stop lines for vehicles and designated spaces for pedestrians, who often face problems negotiating traffic without adequate markings on roads. 
Whenever the traffic police writes to us for support on traffic management, we provide them the facilities required. 
We hope to finish the road marking work very soon in order to enable the traffic police to penalise violators, Chandra said.
