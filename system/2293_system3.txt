 The Noida authority has decided to paint road marks with an aim to streamline traffic movement on city roads.  
Once the road and lane marks are in place, they will help the traffic police in regulating the flow of traffic,? 
The traffic police recently installed close circuit television cameras (CCTVs) at intersections in Sector 57/22 and Sector 2/19 for better traffic management. ?
But we need to have proper road markings before we start penalising motorists caught violating traffic norms. 
The Noida authority and the traffic police have, of late, been struggling to ensure smooth flow of traffic in busy thoroughfares. ?
We hope to finish the road marking work very soon in order to enable the traffic police to penalise violators,?
