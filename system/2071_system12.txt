New Delhi, Dec 13 (PTI) Indian defence forces and defence production would be "open to scrutiny" and "control" by the United States which will make India its "junior ally" following finalisation of the Major Defense Partner designation, CPI(M) has alleged. 
Noting that the US has placed the details of Major Defense Partner designation for Senate approval as part of FY 2017 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), the party said the Narendra Modi government "has not even made a statement in Parliament about such a significant deal."
