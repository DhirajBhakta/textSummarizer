Customers will not suffer any loss if unauthorised electronic banking transactions are reported within three days and the amount involved will be credited in the accounts concerned within 10-days, the Reserve Bank said on Thursday. 
Any loss occurring after reporting of the unauthorised transaction will be borne by the bank, RBI said while issuing revised directions on Customer Protection Limiting Liability of Customers in Unauthorised Electronic Banking Transactions. 
A customer's entitlement to zero liability will also arise where the unauthorised transaction occurs due to "contributory fraud/negligence/deficiency on the part of the bank (irrespective of whether or not the transaction is reported by the customer)", RBI said.
