The UN has dropped the superhero Wonder Woman as an ambassador for empowering girls and women after a brief stint that drew widespread criticism.The campaign around the comic book character, who turned 75 this autumn, lasted for less than two months. 
Among its key aims were challenging female stereotypes and fighting discrimination and violence against women and girls.But the appointment prompted an angry backlash from some quarters. 
From the UNs side, there was no plan for it to be much longer than this, said Jeffrey Brez, the UNs chief of NGO relations and advocacy.DC Entertainment had approached the UN to explore a joint project to mark the characters 75th birthday, Brez said.
