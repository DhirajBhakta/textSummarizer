From Sajjad Hussain Islamabad, Mar 14 (PTI) Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif today ordered authorities to take immediate action against blasphemous content on the social media and remove sacrilegious contents and punish the perpetrators, days after a high court order. 
He also ordered to take necessary actions in accordance with the judicial guidelines issued by the court. 
The Islamabad High Court judge Shuakat Siddiqui last week directed the interior ministry to take actions against Facebook pages with alleged anti-Islam material. 
The lower house also agreed that, if required, the government should take legislative action against those posting blasphemous content on social media.
