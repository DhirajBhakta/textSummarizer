From Dilwale and Bajirao Mastani to Ae Dil Hai Mushkil and Shivaay to Raees and Kaabil, Bollywood saw some of the biggest films take on each other at the ticket windows recently. 
Clash is going to happen. 
?This is not the first time that Akshay's film is facing competition at the box office. 
Last year, Rustom clashed with Hrithik Roshan's Mohenjo Daro, and passed the test with flying colours. 
From a quirky title to an interesting storyline to a fantastic on-screen pairing, the film has already raised expectations. 
The film stars Bhumi Pednekar alongside Akshay and is set to hit the screens on August 11 this year.?
