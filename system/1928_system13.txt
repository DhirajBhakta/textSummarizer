The woman is undergoing treatment at the AIIMS Trauma Centre.Police officials said that the four accused in the rape case are absconding. 
The president of the Residents Welfare Association (RWA), however, said that the builder involved in the rape forcefully entered the familys house, shot at the mother and fled. 
Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) chief Swati Maliwal visited the victim at AIIMS and said the womens panel will set up a committee to look into the incident.It is very shocking that in the capital of this country a 15-year girl was gang-raped and then the accused in this case had the audacity to attack her again after 10-15 days of the incident.
