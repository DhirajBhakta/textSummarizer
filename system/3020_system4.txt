Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi today said he will be taking a break from politics to visit his grandmother abroad, triggering taunts from the opposition BJP which called the visit the "picnic" of a "kid during his summer vacations"."
Earlier, during the New Year Celebrations, the 46-year-old leader had gone to London for a short break.As Rahul's latest foreign visit came amid hectic politics over farmers' protest or the upcoming Presidential election, the BJP took some quick jibes. 
"When we were kids, then we used to go to the nanihaal (maternal grandmother's place) during our summer vacations," senior BJP leader from Madhya Pradesh Kailash Vijayvargiya said."
