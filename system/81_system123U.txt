A Mid Day report said that Koena received a call and a stranger asked her for a night out. 
The man kept calling her despite being rebuffed. 
Koena reportedly got calls from 40-50 unknown numbers over last one week. 
When she picked up one of the calls Saturday evening, the caller offered her money for a night out and even abused Koena, the report said.
