Like Ramesh, there are other 30 other shopkeepers who have lost their livelihood the demolition drive six days after the violence at Mahagun Moderne society violence.Rumours of a domestic help being beaten up and held captive had enraged a mob which allegedly attacked the housing society and vandalised property there.The Noida authority has officially claimed that the demolition was not due to the recent violence, but the demands for action against illegal workers in Noida have increased ever since.However, Ramesh fails to understand what he has to do with it all. 
The action was not taken because of the Mahagun Moderne violence, said Awneesh Kumar, circle officer, city-3, who was a part of the police team accompanying the authoritys demolition wing officials.While there have been calls against illegal Bangladeshis in the area following the Mahagun violence, Kumar said the encroachers in the area were from different parts of India.
