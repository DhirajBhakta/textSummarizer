From Lalit K Jha Washington, Jan 27 (PTI) Two Indian snake hunters have been hired by Florida wildlife officials to get rid of Burmese pythons, which are wiping out small mammal populations driving some nearly to extinction in a tropical wetland in the US state. 
Masi Sadaiyan and Vaidivel Gopal, both in their 50s, from the Irula tribe of Tamil Nadu, are successful python hunters in India, and were brought in, along with two translators, to work with detection dogs earlier this month to track down and capture the giant snakes. 
Officials said they are currently working with the Irula tribesmen to identify additional programmes to remove more nonnative pythons from Florida.
