New Delhi, Jul 2 (PTI) The CISF security cover at the Delhi airport has been recognised as the best service in this domain by a global quality-rating agency. 
The latest initiation of doing away with the tagging and stamping of hand baggages at the Delhi airport and over a dozen others, restoring forgotten items of the passengers and keeping a check on criminal activities at the sensitive airport has fetched the paramilitary this award, a CISF spokesperson said.
