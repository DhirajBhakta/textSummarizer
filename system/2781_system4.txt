After placing Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD)'s Hafiz Saeed under house arrest on January 30, Pakistan has now banned his new terror front Tehreek-e-Azadi-Jammu & Kashmir (TAJK).JuD was declared a terrorist outfit by the US in 2014 and and was again put under the watch list on January 27.
Since then there has been an unending drama of Hafiz Saeed being put under house arrest or detained cursorily before being set free even if the US declared a bounty of USD 10 million on his head in 2012.
That would make it necessary for Pakistan to put a formal request each time it went about transacting any business through any of the international financial institutions.
