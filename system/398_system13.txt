According to Biswal, the attack happened so swiftly that locals could not intervene.When the attackers fled, Tewatia was rushed to a hospital by the locals and one of them called the police.Biswal said the probe so far suggests that the attackers were the same men with whom Tewatia had got into a scuffle minutes earlier.A case of attempt to murder has been registered at Saket police station and a team formed to identify the suspects.
