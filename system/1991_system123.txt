Smuggled gold has been in high demand in India post demonetisation since it is being considered a safe commodity to launder black money that is mostly available in India in old high denomination notes. 
In the wake of demonetisation, DRI is probing the misuse of duty free gold imports into the country, says a DRI release.The purpose of the fraud allegedly committed by Mahalakshmi jewellers was to smuggle/divert high priority gold imported from Dubai into the domestic Indian market by evading 10% basic customs duty.It is estimated that more than Rs150 crore worth of imported duty free bullion has been diverted into the domestic market.
