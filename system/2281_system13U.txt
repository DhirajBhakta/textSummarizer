Third set: Cilic 3-6, 1-6, 2-2 Federer* (*denotes server): Hes obviously not winning this and its a terrible final, but Id say Cilic has done a lot to enhance his reputation in the past few games. 
Unfortunately the chap on the other side of the net is not making this any easier, making it deuce with a searing crosscourt backhand, earning a break point when Cilic nets a forehand.
