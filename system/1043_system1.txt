I immediately realised something was wrong and showed it to the guard at the ATM before visiting the branch manager, said Shashikar.The bank manager, however, returned the hand-written letter to Shashikar by writing that the note in question did not pertain to them as all the notes are sorted before replenishing them in the ATM.An angry Shashikar did not report to work that day and returned home to complain about the error and the bank managers alleged response to his aunt.His aunt immediately shot off a mail to SBI officials at gm.customer@sbi.co.in, but allegedly received no response.
