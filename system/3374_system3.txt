In 1985, the Supreme Court had directed Shah Bano's husband to pay her alimony according to the laws applicable to other Indians.The Supreme Court had rejected the argument of Shah Bano's ex-husband that since she was paid during the period of iddat - the waiting period after divorce and also the amount of mehr, she was not entitled to any further maintenance under the Muslim personal law.MARY ROY CASEThe very next year, the Supreme Court decided another case relating to Christian personal law in the 1986-case of Mary Roy. 
The new Act overturned the judgment of the Supreme Court providing that a man was required to pay maintenance to his divorced wife only during the period of Iddat.Danial Latifi challenged the constitutional validity of the Personal law. 
The Supreme Court, in 2001 during the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government, held that the Muslim Women (Protection on Divorce Act), 1986 did not violate the Constitution or the fundamental rights.The Supreme Court maintained that the personal laws need not be tested on the touchstone of the provisions of the fundamental rights.TRIPLE TALAQ CASE IN BOMBAY HIGH COURTIn another case of triple talaq, the Bombay High Court held in 2002 that if wife contests this practice of divorce, it needed to be proved in a court of law. 
The Bombay High Court also held that a Muslim man did not have a unilateral right to divorce his wife by triple talaq. 
The man is bound to provide good reasons for a divorce.ADOPTION BY MUSLIM WOMENThe Supreme Court again delivered a landmark judgment in 2014 on the question of adoption of child by a Muslim woman. 
The Muslim personal law does not give women of the community the right to adopt children.A three-judge bench of the Supreme Court headed by the then Chief Justice of India P Sathasivam ruled that Muslim women had the right to legally adopt children like any other Indian citizen. 
The Supreme Court held that the right to adopt children could not be denied by Muslim personal law.RIGHT OF UNWED MOTHERUnder the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act of 1956 father was held as the natural guardian of a Hindu child.
