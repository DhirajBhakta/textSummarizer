Washington, May 11 (PTI) The White House has ruled out the appointment of a special prosecutor to investigate the allegations of Russian interference in last years general elections. 
Youve got a House committee, a Senate committee and Department of Justice all working on this," White House Principal Deputy Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters. 
Sanders said Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein has strong bipartisan support and is "independent enough" to carry out the investigation.
