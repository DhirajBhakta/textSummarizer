Professional tennis is getting very physical in the last couple of years.Its not easy to kind of play on the highest level throughout the entire season, then be able to do that over and over again every season, and then stay healthy.The injury was especially frustrating for the 12-time Grand Slam winner as he felt he was finally beginning to play his best tennis after a turbulent period.For an athlete, its really hard to swallow when you have to retire, especially when youre playing well, Djokovic said.I was playing really well, probably the best tennis Ive played in the last 10 months or so.Its just unfortunate.
