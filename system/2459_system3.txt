New Delhi, Jul 13 (PTI) Markets regulator Sebi has asked Goldmine Agro Ltd (GAL) and its directors to refund investors money that the Kolkata-based company had raised illegally by issuing securities. 
Besides, Sebi imposed a ban on the firm and its directors from accessing the capital markets for four years from the completion of refund. 
Goldmine Agro mobilised funds illegally through issuance of non-convertible redeemable debentures (NCDs). 
However, the company had not given details about the number of allottees. 
The company, through such activity, violated various norms, Sebi noted. 
The regulator observed that allotment of NCDs by the firm was a public issue, which under the rules require a compulsory listing on a recognised stock exchange. 
It was also required to file a prospectus, among others, which it failed to do.
