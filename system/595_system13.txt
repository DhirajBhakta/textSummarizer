The Uttar Pradesh government on Monday revoked its decision to provide a dedicated corridor at toll plazas for lawmakers in case of traffic snarls, after drawing flak from the opposition.Additional Chief Secretary Sadakant issued letters to all district magistrates and divisional commissioners modifying an advisory dated July 13, which he said had led to confusion and raised a number of questions.It was mentioned in the advisory that in case of long traffic jams at toll collection centres and plazas, there should be a provision for separate lane for VVIPs....it is being made clear that for the VVIPs, no separate lane at the toll plazas will be constructed.
