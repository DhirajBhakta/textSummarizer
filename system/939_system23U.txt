Poll-bound Gujarat has joined the likes of Tamil Nadu,Odisha and Rajasthan  by coming out with its own version of canteens for  providing  meals to the poor at a highly subsidised rate.Under the Shamik Annapurna Yojna launched on Tuesday, labourers will be provided a meal per day at Rs 10. 
This is probably the first of its kind scheme for labourers, especially the homeless who do not have fuel and utensils for cooking.The meal  five rotis, mixed vegetable, rice, pickles and green chilies (and desert on Sundays)  will be served through saffron-coloured stalls.
