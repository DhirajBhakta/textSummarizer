The hoardings with slogans like "Azadi Di Gal, Punjab Independence, 2020 Referendum" were installed at various places including Fatehgarh, Roopnagar, Dhanaula in Barnala and Rajpura in Patiala.The administration has neither removed the controversial hoardings nor have taken any action against the people behind the controversy. 
Reacting to the controversy, Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) has slammed the state government for having failed to remove the hoardings and maintaining a stoic silence over the efforts being made by the Khalistani groups to revive terrorism. 
While at one hand the Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh is vocal against the Khalistani elements including Sikhs for Justice, his government's silence over the referendum hoardings is deplorable," Secretary BJP, Vineet Joshi said.BJP has appealed the state government to remove the hoardings immediately and threatened to destroy them in case the local administration did not act immediately.
