THE STALIN-ALAGIRI WARBy 2012-13, Stalin began a passive cleansing process within the party where his confidantes replaced those who were loyal to Alagiri. 
This angered Alagiri who openly spoke against Stalin and the party making his father furious. 
Even after the drama that ensued, Alagiri tried to meet his father on many occasions but failed until recently when Karunanidhi was hospitalised The rivalry between the two brothers didn't end.The expulsion of Alagiri also brought Karunanidhi's daughter Kanimozi's position within the party under question as she was much closer to Alagiri. 
It was believed that anytime a question on handing over authority to a successor was put forward to Karunanidhi, the Dravidian stalwart would only give an indirect reply keeping the leadership in uncertainty as he knew that it was the only thing that kept his family together at peace.But as his health deteriorated recently and with the death of former CM and AIADMK chief Jayalalithaa, Stalin's supporters raised flags within the party to make him the next leader.Party insiders were a bit appalled to know that the Stalin camp, demanded absolute power before becoming a working president. 
INSIDE DMK'S GENERAL BODY MEETINGThe DMK must be applauded for its act of passing a resolution, a homage message to the late Chief Minister Jayalalithaa.Then, as party's deputy legislative Assembly leader Thuraimurugan brought forth MK Stalin's name for the post, party general secretary, Anbazagan concurred it.Speaking during the meet, Thuraimurugan broke down to see that his leader is unable to participate but for the betterment of the party agreed to the fact that the party needed a 'working president'.
