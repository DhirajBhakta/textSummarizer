Rishi Kapoor lashed out at director Anurag Basu after the lukewarm response to son Ranbir Kapoors new film, Jagga Jasoos. 
Calling him irresponsible, the actor said that Basu fails to complete films on time. 
In an interview with Mid-Day, Rishi Kapoor also slammed music composer Pritam.  
They dont show their films before release to take opinions, and treat it as though theyre making a nuclear bomb.
