When a disaster like fire or earthquake strikes, our first reaction is to grab our dear ones and run. 
But what about the times when we get separated from someone we love in a moment of such crisis?
That's where real life heroes come in.After an apartment in Santa Monica, California, caught fire recently, somebody's pet dog got trapped inside the burning building. 
When firefighter Andrew Klein noticed, he climbed into the building and rescued the poor dog.However, the dog, who's called Nalu, was no longer breathing and didn't have a pulse. 
Nalu had been "overcome by heat and smoke," the Santa Monica Fire Department said in a statement.Klein, a fireman from the Santa Monica Fire Department, did not give up.
