Convict Afzal Guru hanged inside Tihar jail. 
Prison officials said though there is a post of an executioner in the prison manual ever since its construction in the mid 1950s, jail records do not show any name who has worked as one. 
Sunil Gupta, who served as the law officer in Tihar for three decades, told HT that an executioners role is not a positive one.
