An analysis of remuneration disclosures made by top listed companies forming part of the blue-chip index Sensex -- under directions of the capital markets regulator Sebi -- shows that the pay packages of senior-most personnel such as CEOs and executive chairmen continue to remain high and rose further at most private sector firms during 2016-17. 
TOP EXECUTIVES' PAY REMAINS HIGH On the contrary, the median employee remuneration fell or remained almost same during the last fiscal, while the ratio of the top executives' pay to the median employee remuneration remained at astronomically high levels of hundreds-times in many cases. 
SEBI REGULATIONS REQUIRE COMPANIES TO DISCLOSE REMUNERATIONS? While the rules do not put any restrictions on the companies regarding how much more they want to pay their top executives vis-a-vis an average employee, the Sebi regulations require most listed companies to annually disclose various remuneration ratios to help the investors know about salary practices at the firms in which they have invested. 
INCREASE IN RATIO OF TOP EXECUTIVE PAY?Among the 30 Sensex firms, at least 15 have already disclosed an increase in the ratio of top executive pay with that of the median employee remuneration for 2016-17. 
Six Sensex companies have reported some decline in this ratio and these include Wipro (down from 260 times to 259 times), Infosys (283 times), Dr Reddys Lab (from 312 times to 233 times) and Hero MotoCorp (from 755 times to 731 times). 
Among other major Sensex firms, TCS saw the ratio between top-paid executive pay and the median employee remuneration rise to 515 times (from 460 times in previous year), while the same for Lupin stood at 1,263-times (though down from 1,317 times) for Chairman. 
Among banks, the ratio was highest for HDFC Banks CEO Aditya Puri (whose pay package rose by 20 per cent to over Rs 10 crore) where it rose from 179 to 187 times. 
Other companies that saw an increase in the ratio included Bharti Airtel (to 366-times in 2016-17), Cipla (416 times), M&M (108 times), Tata Steel (94 times) and HUL (138 times).
