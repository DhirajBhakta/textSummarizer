Rafia Qaseem Baig, who joined police force as a constable seven years ago, will work in BDU after completing her 15-day training along with 31 other male members at Nowsheras School of Explosive Handling, media reports said. 
Rafia, who belongs to a highly educated family, said a blast near a sessions court seven years ago motivated her to join the force. 
She then pursued another masters degree in Economics and worked at International Rescue Committee where she developed a passion for law and enrolled in an LLB programme that is currently under way. 
However, she chose to join police force in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province when extremists were overtly targeting security forces.
