to the PWD as per a state government notification in June.Due to massive inflow of traffic on the Ghaziabad-Meerut Road (erstwhile NH-58), officials of the Ghaziabad Development Authority (GDA) had proposed the construction of a flyover and also altered the design, by making it a split-type flyover, as the regional rapid transit system (RRTS) corridor passes through the median of the road.?
They will have to prepare a service lane in the area and also have to take care of the piped gas line that passes through the area. 
The clearance was given on a review of the traffic regulation plan and provision for the RRTS alignment. 
We are also planning to make the road a state highway and will send a proposal to the government.
