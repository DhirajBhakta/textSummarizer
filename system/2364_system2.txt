Good news for commuters travelling between Andheri and Borivli  Western Railway (WR)is set to introduce seven new local train services on the section in October. 
Two local trains will operate during the morning peak hours and two during the evening.In May,WR officials had asked the commission of railway safety (CRS) for permission to operate local trains on the suburban track avoiding fifth line between Andheri and Borivli. 
Until then, this line was reserved for long-distance trains.The CRS granted them permission immediately. 
Earlier, both the Central and WR authorities had decided to induct 80 new services after a new timetable was created. 
The line between Andheri and Borivli was used for only mail express trains. 
Now, we will be able to have more services, which will help decongest the section, said Mukul Jain, divisional railway manager, WR.
