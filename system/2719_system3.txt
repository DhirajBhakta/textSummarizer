Washington, Jul 4 (PTI) Scientists, including one of Indian origin, have developed a smart headlight system for the first time that can help drivers see through heavy rain or snowfall and safely navigate roads during stormy nights. 
"And because the precipitation particles arent being illuminated, the driver wont see the rain or snow either," To people, rain can appear as elongated streaks that seem to fill the air. 
At low speeds, such a system could eliminate 70 to 80 per cent of visible rain during a heavy storm, while losing only five or six per cent of the light from the headlamp.
