It was a large scale operation and was for financial gain, Judge Nigel Seed told them.Daljit was jailed for seven years, Harmit for four and a half years and Chawla, a member of the same extended family, for seven and a half years.The gang was paid more than 9,000 pounds for each family they got into the UK, smuggling nearly 70 people into the country in the estimated 620,000 pound-scam.They travelled to France and handed over passports to waiting immigrants and then collected them once they safely got within the UK territory.Once the immigrants got into the UK, the gang would recycle the passports passing them on to others trying to sneak into the country.All the passports shown by the Afghans had photos of Sikhs wearing their turbans and border staff failed to spot the difference.In total, 69 individuals who travelled to the UK on the passports were identified and 59 did not make an asylum application.The central aim was to gain financially.
