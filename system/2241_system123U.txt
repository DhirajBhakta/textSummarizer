Comparing tigers and Mangalyaan may seem bizarre but a new bio-economic analysis throws up interesting statistics -- saving two big cats gives more value than the cost of Indias much-hyped maiden mission to Mars.In a one-of-its-kind analysis, an Indo-Australian team of scientists has published a paper titled Making the hidden visible: Economic valuation of tiger reserves in India in the journal Ecosystem Services.It says saving two tigers yields a capital benefit of about Rs 520 crore; in comparison ISROs maiden mission to mars Mangalyaan cost the country Rs 450 crore.According to the last estimate, India is home to 2,226 adult tigers which would mean a capital benefit of about Rs 5.7 lakh crore -- almost equivalent to a third of the total currency that was demonetised by the government!
