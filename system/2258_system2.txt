The Maharashtra government has hiked the monthly honorarium of elected representatives to municipal bodies in the state, including the Mumbai civic body ? 
The government has for the first time decided to determine honorarium for the corporators based on the category of the civic bodies. 
The BMC is the only municipal body that comes under A+ category.With the decision, corporators of A+ municipal corporation will now get a honorarium of Rs25,000 a month. 
Rs15,000 (100% rise), while C and D class honorarium for corporators will be Rs10,000 a month (33% rise).Except Mumbai, all the other corporators from rest of the municipal bodies were getting Rs7,500 a month as honorarium from 2010. 
A resolution for rise in the monthly honorarium of the corporators was passed at the Mayor Conference held in Mumbai on June 29, 2016, suggesting Rs 25,000 for Mayor, Rs 20,000 for deputy mayor and Rs15,000 for corporators across the state. 
Instead, the government decided to determine honorarium of the corporators based on their categories.
