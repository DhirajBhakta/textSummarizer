New Delhi, Aug 1 (PTI) Finance Minister Arun Jaitley today said a "proper decision" would be taken on Air Indias future in a competitive market and that it would be in the governments interest to protect jobs at the airline. 
The previous UPA government had extended bailout package worth little over Rs 30,000 crore to the national carrier for a 10-year period starting from 2012.
