They have so far planted 5,500 saplings. 
The senior Athalye first planted 100 sapling at unit 16 in Aarey. 
Over the next 15 years, he planted more than 3,500 saplings at Panchavati, New Zealand hostel, VIP guest house, Gaondevi Road and MHADA Road. ?
he said, adding that his son Malhar has planted saplings all by himself and loves to be in the company of butterflies.Their efforts come at a time when Aarey is being besieged by several development projects.
