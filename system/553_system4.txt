Nation building requires national pride:- We take pride in the soil and water of India;- We take pride in the diversity, religious harmony and inclusive ethos of India;- We take pride in the culture, heritage and spirituality of India;- We take pride in our fellow citizens;- We take pride in our work; and- We take pride in the little things we do every day.Each citizen of India is a nation builder. 
Or at a laboratory lit up by giant screens.- That tribal and ordinary citizen striving to preserve our ecology, our forests, our wildlife, to push back climate change and to advance the cause of renewable energy, is a nation builder.- That committed and driven public servant who works beyond the call of duty, whether on a flooded road, directing traffic; or in a quiet room, poring over detailed files, is a nation builder.- That self-less teacher who equips young children and shapes their destinies, is a nation builder.- Those countless women who take care of families with so many other responsibilities, at home and work, and raise children to become ideal citizens, are nation builders.People elect their representatives from the Gram Panchayat to Parliament.
