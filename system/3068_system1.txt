A 17-year-old girl in Tamil Nadu's Erode district who was being treated for epilepsy and weight loss by a herbal treatment centre died under mysterious circumstances. 
BhakyaSri was left under the care of the herbal treatment centre owner and relative Naveen Balalji by her parents on June 2 to attend a wedding function. 
To their shock, when they returned, they found BhakyaSri's dead body in a freezer box kept at the doorstep. 
BhakyaSri's father believes she was administered wrong dose of medicine which turned to be fatal and is now demanding strictest of action against Balaji. 
BhakyaSri's relatives claim that Naveen Balaji who runs the herbal treatment centre in Erode is a fraud and has no authorisation from medical bodies or the government.
