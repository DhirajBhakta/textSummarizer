According to testimony of BhakyaSri's neighbours, they saw the staff of the treatment centre drop off the freezer box on June 3. 
Clash between the family members of BhakyaSri and Balaji broke out when he visited the family at the Coimbatore hospital. 
BhakyaSri's relatives claim that Naveen Balaji who runs the herbal treatment centre in Erode is a fraud and has no authorisation from medical bodies or the government.
