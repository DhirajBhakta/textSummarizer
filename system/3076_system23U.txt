Kabir Khan's Tubelight has already grabbed eyeballs for the on-screen camaraderie between Salman Khan and Sohail Khan, who play brothers in the film too. 
The director, who has collaborated with Salman for the third time, said that he had a few actors in his mind during the scripting stage, and Khiladi Kumar was one of them. 
However, it was Salman who was keen to get Sohail on board as he was convinced that their real-life bromance will translate effectively on screen.
