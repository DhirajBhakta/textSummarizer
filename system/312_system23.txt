What I am going to do is to spell out the Indian tigers wishlist in the hope that those that engage with tigers will rethink and review their strategies.The most important item on the wishlist is to see a mindset change in the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) where this specially created institution starts to imbibe field wisdom about wild tigers through innovative strategies on both protection and tourism. 
Frequent meetings of the state board of wildlife that chief ministers chair are vital to resolving the tigers problems.The Prime Minister of the country must play his role for the sake of our national animal.
