The railway ministry plans to introduce its ambitious integrated ticketing system in the next three years and Mumbai will be the first city to experience it. 
Primarily a Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) project, the system will integrate all public transport ? 
Mumbai Rail Vikas Corporation (MRVC) and Central and Western Railway officials are currently studying different ways to sync the new software with the existing system. 
The project will be executed in two stages: in the first, the software will be integrated with the existing ticketing system and in the second, entry and exit gates will be installed at stations. 
With new Metro lines coming up in the city, MMRDA said the single ticketing system would be a boon to travellers.
