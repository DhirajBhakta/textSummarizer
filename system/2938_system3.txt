In an interview with Mid-Day, Sridevi opened up about her daughters, Jhanvi and Khushi, and how they make her feel proud as a mother.Talking about Jhanvi's Bollywood debut, Student Of The Year 2, Sridevi said, "She wanted to do the film and initially, I wasn't in favour. 
But her happiness matters more, and if she does well as an actress, I will be a proud mother."
But no matter how late I get, Khushi, always welcomes me with a smile. 
But they (people) thought I was promoting Jhanvi. 
Last year, when Khushi wrote a post about body shaming on Instagram, I was pleasantly surprised to see my kid turn into a strong, opinionated and sharp young woman," she said.On the work front, Sridevi is gearing up for the release of her film, Mom, which will hit theatres on July 7.
