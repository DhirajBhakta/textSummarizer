A poster sprung up in Ahmedabad embarrassing the ruling BJP.The poster has the pictures of 110 senior BJP leaders of the state, including those of party's national president Amit Shah and Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani. 
The caption on it says: "Identify the leaders or you will lose your job."
This situation arose after action was taken against two employees - a sanitation worker and a security guard - for not recognising the BJP leaders.Gandhinagar Municipal Corporation's standing committee chairperson Manubhai Patel suspended a sanitation worker after the latter allegedly did not recognise him during a surprise visit.In a similar incident a few days ago, a security guard could not recognise Gujarat Assembly Speaker Ramanlal Vora during the latter's visit to Gandhinagar Civil Hospital.While the security guard lost his job, contract of the security agency was reportedly also terminated.Following the two incidents, some unidentified people pasted bills in Gandhinagar.
