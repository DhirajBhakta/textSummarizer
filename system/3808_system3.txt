Hazare said he was opposed to the proposed change in allowing withdrawal of appeal to the CIC. 
Pointing out that there have been 56 cases of murder of RTI applicant in the last year, Hazare said the proposed change will make the things more dangerous. 
Hazare also opposed the proposed limit of 500 words for an RTI application saying that it would be unjust for common people.
