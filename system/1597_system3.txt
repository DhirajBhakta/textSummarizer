Mahendra Singh Dhoni, who stepped down as India's limited-overs captain on January 4 after a trophy-laden nine-year reign, said he was ready to change his batting order according to the future requirements of the team but won't grow the billowing mane that once made him the cynosure of all eyes. 
Over the years, I changed my batting order according to the team's requirements. 
I am ready to change my batting order according to the responsibility given to me in the times ahead," Dhoni said at the conference which was held in Pune ahead of India's first ODI against England on January 15.
