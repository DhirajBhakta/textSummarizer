The worlds eight richest billionaires control the same wealth between them as the poorest half of the globes population, according to a charity warning of an ever-increasing and dangerous concentration of wealth.In a report published to coincide with the start of the week-long World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Oxfam said it was beyond grotesque that a handful of rich men headed by the Microsoft founder Bill Gates are worth $426bn (?350bn), equivalent to the wealth of 3.6 billion people.The development charity called for a new economic model to reverse an inequality trend that it said helped to explain Brexit and Donald Trumps victory in the US presidential election.Oxfam blamed rising inequality on aggressive wage restraint, tax dodging and the squeezing of producers by companies, adding that businesses were too focused on delivering ever-higher returns to wealthy owners and top executives.The World Economic Forum (WEF) said last week that rising inequality and social polarisation posed two of the biggest risks to the global economy in 2017 and could result in the rolling back of globalisation.Oxfam said the worlds poorest 50% owned the same in assets as the $426bn owned by a group headed by Gates, Amancio Ortega, the founder of the Spanish fashion chain Zara, and Warren Buffett, the renowned investor and chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway.The others are Carlos Slim Hel?: the Mexican telecoms tycoon and owner of conglomerate Grupo Carso; Jeff Bezos: the founder of Amazon; Mark Zuckerberg: the founder of Facebook; Larry Ellison, chief executive of US tech firm Oracle; and Michael Bloomberg; a former mayor of New York and founder and owner of the Bloomberg news and financial information service.Last year, Oxfam said the worlds 62 richest billionaires were as wealthy as half the worlds population.
