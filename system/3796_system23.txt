New Delhi, Apr 13 (PTI) An employer, not a court, will decide whether a probationary employees services are satisfactory, the Delhi High Court has said. 
It said that since the man, who was appointed on April 4, 2011, did not complete three years of service in the school, he would not be entitled to be confirmed as an employee as was ruled by the Delhi High Court in another matter in 2013.
