The incident of two boys being allegedly forced to recite the Quran and espouse the cause of Islam at a Mewat school came to light after they applied for a School Leaving Certificate and a transfer.On the face of it, it was a simple transfer application. 
The deputy commissioner immediately sent a team to the school and appropriate action was taken, Shamim Ahmed, project officer of the Mewat Development Agency (under which the  school is run), and one of the members of the inquiry committee who would look into the issue, said.Officials said they further got to know later that not only the teachers, against whom action was taken on Friday, but also some students of school in Madhi village, allegedly forced the students to offer namaz with them, and follow Islam.When I complained on July 22, I didnt name any of the teachers.
