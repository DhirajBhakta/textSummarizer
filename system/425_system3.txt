In an unprecedented verdict, a Delhi court on Wednesday awarded a two-month jail term to a school principal and its director for causing mental trauma to a 7-year-old girl by not allowing her to enter the classroom. 
It took us over two months to find another school, and my child remained at home all this while for no fault of hers, the girls father told Hindustan Times. 
The girls father had complained that his daughter was ill treated and confined by the school management throughout the school hours on April 24, 2012, in order to pressurise him to withdraw her from school. 
He said that instead of keeping her in the class with her classmates, she was wrongly confined to various other places in the school where neither children were present nor any activity was going on. 
It further said that the child cannot be thrown out at the whim and fancies of the school authorities.The girls father said that he ran from pillar to post to get justice for her daughter, who is now 12-years-old.
