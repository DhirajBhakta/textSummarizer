I know Nitishs intentions as he wants to sacrifice my children for his glory and name, Lalu Prasad added.On Monday, Nitish Kumar, while addressing his first press conference after joining hands with the BJP, declared that no one is capable to face and beat Prime Minister Modi in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.He praised Modi, calling him the biggest leader in the country and added that there is no one who can defeat him.Nitish Kumar also explained that he had given his long time friend Lalu Prasad ample opportunities to explain the charges of corruption against him, but to no avail.If Lalu Prasad had explained himself over the corruption allegations, then the situation could have been different in Bihar, Nitish Kumar said.I had asked Lalu to clarify the allegations of corruption against him and put the facts forward.
