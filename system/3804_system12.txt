Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday launched BHIM-Aadhar pay app, that will allow people to make payments without using a smartphone. 
The app, which will be available for download to merchants across the country, will link your Aadhaar number and biometric fingerprint to complete a transaction. 
To enable the transactions through BHIM-Aadhar, merchants will have to purchase fingerprint scanners.With the implementation of the new system, all you will need is your fingerprint to make a payment.
