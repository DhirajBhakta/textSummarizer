Washington, Jun 24 (PTI) Your brain power may be significantly reduced when your smartphone is within reach - even if it is switched off - affecting your ability to concentrate on a task, scientists have found. 
The tests were geared to measure participants available cognitive capacity - that is, the brains ability to hold and process data at any given time. 
"We see a linear trend that suggests that as the smartphone becomes more noticeable, participants available cognitive capacity decreases," said Adrian Ward, Assistant Professor at University of Texas at Austin.
