The South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) is planning to install 100 mobile toilet vans at jhuggis/ slum clusters falling under its jurisdiction, inorder to achieve 100% open defecation-free (ODF) tag. 
We had to request the DUSIB and Railways to speed up construction of toilets and if there is no land, they should approach other agencies, said a senior official.But since the implementation of this was taking time, the agency decided to place mobile toilets.
