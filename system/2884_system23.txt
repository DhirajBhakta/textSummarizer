Union Minister M Venkaiah Naidu may have just stoked fresh controversy over use of Hindi language. 
Venkaiah Naidu today said Hindi language is the identity of the Indians. 
"(Hindi) Hamari matribhasha hamari pehchan hai. 
Venkaiah Naidu had said that the Centre was only 'promoting' not 'imposing' Hindi on anyone. 
The parliamentary panel had recommended the use of Hindi by parliamentarians and ministers.
