According to the owners, they are trying to get permission from agencies concerned to build a multiplex at the same spot.The facade will not be changed as the building is a heritage structure but inside there will be major changes including a new design of the hall, better seats, new toilets and canteen, said Choudhary.The corridors and the staircase of the hall is lined with black and white photographs of actors Dev Anand, Meena Kumari, Nargis, and Raj Kapoor.Raj Kapoor and Nargis would spend time a lot of time here.
