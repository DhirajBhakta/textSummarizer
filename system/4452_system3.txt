The Indian Air Force will in the next few weeks finish weaving a security web with the Israeli SPYDER air defence missile system on the western borders in a bid to strengthen its preparedness to strike down any aerial threat from Pakistan.The induction process was delayed by over three years due to the nonavailability of Czech-made Tatra trucks on which the missiles were to be carried."
The SPYDER missile system is already in the process of deployment along the western borders where it will help in tackling any aircraft, cruise missile, surveillance plane or drone that tries to violate our airspace," senior defence sources told MAIL TODAY.WHAT IS SPYDERThe SPYDER (Surface-to-air PYthon and DERby) is a low-level, quick reaction missile (LLQRM) to neutralise hostile targets up to 15 km away and at heights between 20 and 9,000 metres. 
Due to the lack of heavy specialised trucks, changes had to be made in the contract with the vendors and a made-in-India truck has been used for carrying the SPYDER system, which has been tested extensively resulting in delays," the sources said.Both the SPYDER and Akash are all-weather missiles and the process to seek and engage an aggressive aircraft or missile is automatic. 
Besides aircraft and UAVs, they can also neutralise lowlevel cruise missiles.The IAF has taken a slew of measures to strengthen its air defence capabilities in the recent past as it is also going to deploy another air defence system called the Medium Range Surface to Air Missile (MRSAM) system from Israel, which can strike down targets at 50-70km.The force would receive a major boost when it starts getting the S-400 air defence missile system from Russia, which can take out targets at 400 km and can be very effective against enemy AWACS (Airborne Warning And Control System) and cruise missiles at great distances.ALSO READ:?
