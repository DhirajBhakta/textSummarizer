s coastline, a seven-and-a-half-foot-long  sperm whale washed ashore at Rajodi beach, Virar, around 3pm on Thursday.Though the state mangrove cell confirmed that it was a sperm whale, the officials are unclear whether it was a juvenile whale or a pygmy or a dwarf (subspecies). 
Fishermen from Rajodi said they spotted the whale close to the shoreline towards the south side of the beach and it looked injured. ?
The mammal most likely hit a large rock close to the shoreline and got injured. 
We tried pulling it out, but it died as soon as it came close to the beach. 
This species of whale has not washed ashore along the state?
