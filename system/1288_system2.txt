Former England batsman and captain Kevin Pietersen known for his flamboyant style on and off the field responded to Alastair Cook's resignation in a humorous way by tweeting - #BringBackKPCook stepped down as England's Test captain after 59 matches in charge. 
In all likelihood, Joe Root is like to take over as Test captain.A change in leadership was imminent after England went down 4-0 to India in the five-Test series.Pietersen, who last played a Test against Australia in Sydney back in January 2014 has always been vocal about making a comeback for England in international cricket. 
Since then KP has not represented England in any of the formats.He has been playing T20 Leagues around the world and has been working hard in county cricket for Surrey, still harbouring a dream return to international cricket.
