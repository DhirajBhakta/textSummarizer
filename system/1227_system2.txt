and God : HC New Delhi, Feb 10 (PTI) Priests ought not to obstruct communication between devotees and God, the Delhi High Court today said while giving suggestions on managing the rush of people at Kalkaji Temple here. 
The observation came from Justice J R Midha who also said that the "working in the temple has to improve. 
This is not the way. 
I am concerned whether a temple should be run in this way". 
"There is only a fraction of a second for a person to view the deity. 
Within that fraction of a second, there should be no obstruction between devotees and God. 
Here (the temple) the fraction of a second is not unobstructed. 
I also go to that temple. 
"People (the priests) are there only to obstruct. 
Give a person one or two seconds to communicate with God.
