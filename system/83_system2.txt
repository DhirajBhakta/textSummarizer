Teachers can bring their children to the cr?che, which will be functional between 9am to 5pm.College principal Pratyush Vatsala said the move will help teachers focus on their work without constantly worrying about their children.As a young teacher, I was constantly worried about my kids. 
If I had a cr?che at my work place then it would have made my life so much easier. 
If the employee is free of tension then he or she can focus on work better. 
It is good for the individual as well as the institution, she said.Teachers will have to pay Rs4,000 per month for availing the facility. 
The initial building cost is being borne by the college but the recurring expenditure will be borne by the teachers availing the facility, she said.
