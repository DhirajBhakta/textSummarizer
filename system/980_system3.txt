The remarkable change in the way the world watches TV has been underlined by new data from Netflix showing that more than 100 million people worldwide now subscribe to the streaming service.The company - which is now valued at $78bn (?60bn), making it worth almost nine times as much as the UKs ITV and1.5 times bigger then Rupert Murdochs 21st Century Fox - added 5.2 milllion subscribers in the second quarter.It was a far bigger number than Wall Street had expected and this is traditionally Netflixs slowest time of the year: over the past five years it has averaged growth of less than 2 million in the spring months.Most of the growth  more than 4 million of the new users  came from international subscribers lured by Netflixs combination of new shows such as The Crown and Stranger Things, while stalwarts House of Cards and Orange is the New Black are continuing tofind new audiences.In the past two decades the company has transformed from a California-based mail order DVD outfit to a global digital giant that has transformed the way the public watch TV.The companys share price climbed almost 10% to $180 a share in after-hours trading in New York on Monday, after the new subscriber numbers were revealed. 
Netflix has seen its share price rocket 64% over the past year  it is worth almost four times as much as Sky  but it still only ranks as the minnow of the group.Hastings said the company intends to invest even more in content, even though it is already pouring $6.6bn into making and acquiring TV shows and films this year.
