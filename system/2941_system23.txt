West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Monday expressed her surprise at the BJP's decision to announce Bihar Governor Ram Nath Kovind's name as the NDA presidential candidate.In her very first reaction, Mamata said, " I felt I fell from the sky"."
I don't know him," she said in her statement. 
I love everyone but we have to know the background, the person and then only can we support the candidature," she said while justifying her position.The Trinamool Congress supremo said she had spoken to a few opposition leaders who were equally surprised by the BJP's announcement.
