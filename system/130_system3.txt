I just want to not do anything... just sit back and see what has happened in the past one year and probably look forward to setting some new goals for the next year,? 
Every year, I like that pressure that my friends and family have to bring their creative side out and think of a gift,? 
Once, she just got a new photo album and put together selected pictures from my childhood till that birthday and gave it to me. 
It would be special because you are the most important person [that day] and all your friends want to be around you all the time,?
