I try to take that one day off and even if I am shooting abroad, I make sure to get that one day off. 
I just want to not do anything... just sit back and see what has happened in the past one year and probably look forward to setting some new goals for the next year, says Taapsee, who just wrapped up the last shooting schedule for her upcoming film Judwaa 2, co-starring Varun Dhawan and Jacqueline Fernandez.I have been on a pre-birthday vacation this year. 
Every year, I like that pressure that my friends and family have to bring their creative side out and think of a gift, says Taapsee, adding that her mom gets really frustrated, running out of creative ideas for what more to gift her daughter.Once, she just got a new photo album and put together selected pictures from my childhood till that birthday and gave it to me.
