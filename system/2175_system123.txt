A group 50 students and teachers on Monday staged protested at the University of Mumbais (MUs) campus,Fort, against the delay in declaring degree college results. 
The protesters, led by Bombay University and College Teachers Union (BUCTU), criticised the varsitys failure in assessing papers and declaring results within 45 days of examination  as required by the law. 
They also voiced opposition to what they termed as extreme harassment of examiners by issuing  threatening  letters to them.This year, the MU adopted an on-screen marking process for assessing answersheets against  the traditional pen-and-paper evaluation.
