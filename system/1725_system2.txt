Opposition parties demanding Budget dates to be postponed in view of Assembly elections in five states - Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Goa and Manipur.A Supreme Court bench headed by Chief Justice Jagdish Singh Khehar said, "will hear the matter in due course of time, but not now."
The government has announced that the Budget will be tabled on February 1 while polls while Assembly polls will begin from February 4. 
'PRESENT? BUDGET AFTER MARCH' "We have a simple solution. 
Present the budget after March 8 and get it passed before March 31, there's plenty of time," Trinamool Congress's Derek O'Brien said. 
Polls will get over in all the five states by March 8 and counting will take place on March 11. 
It is the mandate of the EC to ensure that no situation arises that may vitiate the free and fair polls. 
The budget is a constitutional duty of the government and not related to any one state. 
The presentation of the budget is not a sudden decision rather it has been decided beforehand with prior information to the stakeholders," Union Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said.
