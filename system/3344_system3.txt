Located at the Heritage Transport Museum, India's only transport museum, the steam engine was unveiled at the museum on Saturday.Home to about 2,500 curated vintage cars, buses, trains and pre-mechanised modes of transportation like bullock carts and even boats and an aviation gallery, the museum is the brainchild of Tarun Thakral, founder and managing trustee, and traces the evolution of modes of transport in India."
The 12.5-ft tall and 31-ft long engine moved back and forth on the relatively small track, using wood to obtain the steam. 
"It took three months to restore it, while permissions and talks with the Indian Railways to acquire it took about three years. 
So, I applied for permissions and decided to open a transport museum," concludes Tarun
