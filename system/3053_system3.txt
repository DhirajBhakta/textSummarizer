New Delhi, Jun 11 (PTI) The worlds largest fiscal reform, Goods and Services Tax (GST), should not be implemented with "jugaad" and the rollout date for the new indirect tax regime should be postponed by a month, West Bengal Finance Minister Amit Mitra said today. 
In the meeting today, the GST Council decided that traders, manufacturers and restaurant owners with turnover of up to Rs 75 lakh can opt for a composition scheme and pay taxes at the rate of 1, 2, and 5 per cent respectively. 
Besides, movie tickets costing up to Rs 100 will now attract 18 per cent tax, as against 28 per cent proposed earlier, while those above Rs 100 will continue to attract 28 per cent GST.
