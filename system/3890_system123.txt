Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said today that the cancellation of AAPs office allotment was part of a larger design to 'finish' the party. 
He said the party is being 'victimised' and 'discriminated against' for taking on the ruling mafia and siding with the poor, and asserted the Aam Aadmi Party is ready to operate from the 'streets'. 
The office allotment to the AAP by the Kejriwal government was cancelled by the Delhi Lieutenant Governor yesterday after the Shunglu Committee pointed out 'irregularities' in the allotment.
