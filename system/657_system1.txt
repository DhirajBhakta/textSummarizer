The  Brihanmumbai Sarvajanik Ganeshotsav Samanvay Samiti (BSGSS), the umbrella body of Ganesh mandals, has asked mandals to speak to MPs and MLAs in their constituencies to push the Centre to abolish silence zones, as an amendment to the noise rules. 
BSGSS? 
decision comes a day after HT reported the state asked the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change to remove the concept of silence zones from the Noise Pollution (Control and Regulation) Rules, 2000, ahead of this year?
The WHO has said long-term exposure to noise levels between 85db and 90db leads to hearing loss.Anti-noise campaigners were shocked with the state?
