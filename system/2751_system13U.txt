China has called off the annual media trip that it organises for journalists to travel to Tibet. 
Following the recent border stand-off between Chinese and Indian troops, the tour of five Indian and as many Nepalese journalists has been cancelled.No official reason was given by the embassy officials to the journalists. 
One of the participants, Vijay Naik, Convenor of Indian Association of Foreign Affairs Correspondents said, "The invite was received but because the tensions have increased the Chinese may have thought of letting things cool down and let the atmosphere become conducive again for the media programme to resume.
