Just a few days before his death, Howlett had helped liberate another north Atlantic right whale in the region, cutting away a fishing line caught in its mouth. 
Each situation is unique, and entangled whales can be unpredictable.Howletts death comes amid the unprecedented loss of seven north Atlantic right whales in the past month. 
A team included marine biologists, federal scientists and pathologists, among others, have been racing to figure out why the whales  which live along the eastern seaboard of Canada and the US and can reach up to 16 metres (50ft) in length  are dying in large numbers. 
Last week, they carried out necropsies on three of the seven whales, hoping to find clues before the carcasses decompose. 
While their findings are still preliminary and dont explain why the deaths have seemingly occurred within such a short time frame, they found signs of severe blunt trauma and bruising on two of the whales, suggesting collision with a vessel, while the third had been tangled in fishing gear for weeks.
