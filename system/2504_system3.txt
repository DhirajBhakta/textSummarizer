I mean any character you play, you have to really commit to it and kind of naturally become like that, at least thats how I function. 
Like my very first scene in the movie is me sitting at a dining table across from her and misbehaving with her -- it was terrifying, Dawn quoted her as saying on Wednesday.We had to shoot in Georgia and it was freezing cold... 
I always knew that if I worked in Bollywood, I have certain limitations and boundaries that I would not want to cross and this movie was about a sensitive topic, everything was handled so tastefully.The actor is all praise for her co-star Sridevi, who plays her mother in the movie.
