By Aditi Khanna London, Jul 18 (PTI) Britains first woman Sikh MP has been elected to an influential cross-party panel in the UK Parliament that examines the workings of the Home Office. 
The House of Commons Home Affairs Select Committee was chaired by Keith Vaz, Britains longest-serving Indian-origin MP, until he stepped down from the post last year. 
"The APPG has made an excellent start this week...we are confident Preet will make an excellent chair to guide the APPG to make concrete progress on some of the key issues of importance to the Sikh community," said Bhai Amrik Singh, chair of Sikh Federation (UK).
