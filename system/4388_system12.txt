Singer-actor Suchitra, who is known for her hit songs like Uyirin Uyire, May Maasam 98'il and Dole Dole, created a storm when she posted a series of tweets attacking South superstar Dhanush. 
However, her husband, actor Karthik Kumar, claimed that her Twitter account was hacked. 
"Verified info: apparently Mr Hacker thinks - by including a picture of himself in the leaked pix, he won't invite suspicion on himself," one of her tweets read.
