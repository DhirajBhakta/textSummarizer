A?Swedish brewery called Pang Pang has partnered with a creative agency called Snask to create a product,?that has become the ultimate elixir for a blissful shower.Appropriately dubbed?as Shower Beer, this product?is "sweet, but strong" and "meant to gulp in three sips while standing in the shower."
The brewery's founder, Fredrik Tunedal, told VICE that he "wanted to optimise the experience of having beer in the shower by trying to customize a brew for this glorious occasion."
It is strong and has? relatively high alcohol content (in regards to other beers) so that you can start feeling the happy shower beer effects quickly--even if a little water gets in the bottle and dilutes the libation.Also read: Is beer healthier than milk?
