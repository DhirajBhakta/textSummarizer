Manoj Desai, executive director of Maratha Mandir Cinema, said the makers of the film thought of launching the trailer there as Parkar lived in Dongri, which is very close to Maratha Mandir. 
The film-makers approached me with the idea and said they would pay equivalent to a houseful show. 
I ran the idea past Yash Raj Films (producers of DDLJ), who agreed and that is how this was planned.? 
The tickets for the matinee show cost between Rs15-20 and the theatre is mostly full, especially on weekends.A board outside the theatre on Monday informed DDLJ fans that the show had been cancelled.
