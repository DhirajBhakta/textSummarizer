Pakistan captain Misbah-ul-Haq created a unique record when he was dismissed for 99 against the West Indies on the third day of the second Test.Misbah, who was eyeing his 11th Test century, gloved a rising delivery from the home captain Jason Holder for an easy catch to Shai Hope at second slip, thus making him the first batsman in the rich history of Test cricket to score 99 on three occasions. 
Nine other players have two scores off 99, a list which also has his countryman Salim Malik.The 42-year-old right-handed batsman also became the first player to score 99 in two consecutive Tests.Last week, Misbah became the sixth player to finish a Test on 99 not out and the first since South African Andrew Hall in 2003.Misbah had the dubious honour of becoming the first player from his country to finish on 99 not out during their first innings of last week's seven-wicket first Test victory in Jamaica.
