As has been pointed out, at least they have demonstrated the ability to get runs against international bowling attacks, under the sort of pressure which playing international sport brings. 
40th over: England 122-5 (Stokes 17, Ali 27) We have a quick run our review as Moeen sweeps for two...
38th over: England 120-5 (Stokes 17, Ali 25) A rare quiet over for South Africa, Maharaj struggling manfully to stem the flow of runs ... then, after just a single ceded from the over, Moeen drives its final ball, Morkel keels over but can?
However, I would like to see Buttler given another go in Tests, and think the true tracks in Australia will suit him.
