Delhi Metro stations are soon going to have giant digital walls to play video advertisements minus the audio. 
The move is a departure from Delhi Metro Rail Corporations (DMRC) existing format where only backlit panels are used for ads.With no fare revision in sight, the cash-strapped DMRC is focusing on these alternatives to increase its revenue. 
Digital walls will give us the chance to bring in multiple advertisers at the same time and in the same space, a metro official said.Moreover, it is also a lot easier to manage.
