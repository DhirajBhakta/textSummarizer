Apparently, Big B sent Ranveer a text message on his birthday, but received no response.Amitabh Bachchan wrote on one of Ranveer's replies to a birthday wish, "hey .. but what about my intention .. sent you sms greetings for your birthday .. did not get a reply .. did you see it .. !"
Ranveer then went on to say that it's gestures like these which make Amitabh Bachchan the greatest of all time, adding, "I'm blessed that you even know I exist!"
