Soon after India had beaten Australia in a gruelling contest, an announcement was made that the players would be given a cash incentive of Rs 50 lakh each, Rs 25 lakh to coach Anil Kumble and Rs 15 lakh each to the support staff.This was a move initiated by the Committee of Administrators (CoA) and the CEO.
