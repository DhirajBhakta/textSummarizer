To reduce traffic congestion on the Delhi-Noida-Direct (DND) Flyway, the district administration has proposed that the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) collect tax from commercial vehicles at the toll plaza on two lanes to the extreme left of the plaza.Officials said that the step has been taken to ensure that commuters do not suffer from long snarls during the peak hours, especially in evening.
