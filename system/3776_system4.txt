#NotAllStarKids, the hashtag would read, if social media got wind of what Vivek Oberoi had to go through to bag the now-iconic role of Chandu in Ram Gopal Varma's 2002 film Company and made the story viral. 
But the film wowed critics and audiences alike and the rest is history.Speaking about how he got the role, Vivek Oberoi spoke to Hindustan Times and said, "My father was planning to launch me in an Abbas Mustan film. 
But I always wanted to become an actor on my own, so I told him that I would like to go through my struggle. 
So I went to RGV sir's office, and told him to give me an audition for the role of Chandu.
