A 105-year-old man has made history by cycling more than 14 miles round a track in an hour.Robert Marchand set the first hour record in the over-100s category in 2012, then beat it himself two years later at the age of 102, when he covered more than 16 miles. 
While his distance in Wednesdays ride was not as great as those two, the new over-105s category had been specially created for him to reflect the magnitude of his feat.Cheered by hundreds of fans, the Frenchman completed 92 laps round the velodrome at Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines, near Paris.I did not see the sign warning me I had 10 minutes left, said Marchand.
