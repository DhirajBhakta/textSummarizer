Researchers found that human-made noise doubled background sound levels in 63 per cent of US protected areas, and caused a ten-fold or greater increase in background levels in 21 per cent of protected areas. 
In other words, noise reduced the area that natural sounds can be heard by 50 to 90 per cent. 
"The noise levels we found can be harmful to visitor experiences in these areas, and can be harmful to human health, and to wildlife," said Rachel Buxton, from Warner College of Natural Resources in the US.
