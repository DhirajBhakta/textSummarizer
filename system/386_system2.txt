Boris Johnson has committed the UKs two brand new aircraft carriers to freedom of navigation exercises in the fiercely contested waters of the South China Sea.In a pointed declaration aimed squarely at China, whose island-building and militarisation in the sea has unnerved western powers, the British foreign secretary said that when the ships came into service they would be sent to the Asia-Pacific region as one of their first assignments.One of the first things we will do with the two new colossal aircraft carriers that we have just built is send them on a freedom of navigation operation to this area, Johnson said in Sydney on Thursday, to vindicate our belief in the rules-based international system and in the freedom of navigation through those waterways which are absolutely vital for world trade.He later reiterated the point in a speech  only to confuse listeners by adding in a Q&A: We havent yet quite decided to do that  but they are coming.The South China Sea is one of the busiest commercial sea routes in the world, carrying $5tn worth of trade a year.
