National award winning actor Mithun Chakraborty has acted in many acclaimed Hindi, Bengali, Oriya and Telugu films, and if there is one piece of advice that he would like to give the younger crop of actors, it would be  to focus on talent and not just looks.?
says Chakraborty, who has been part of films such a Shaukeen (1982), Swami Dada (1982) and Disco Dancer (1982).The 67-year-old actor is back on the small screen as part of the comedy show, The Drama Company, in which he is working with big television comedians  such as Krushna Abhishek, Ali Asgar and Sugandha Mishra. 
I have been working for almost 300 days out of 365 days in a year and suddenly because of back pain I was bedridden.
