If tourism in Maharashtra has been progressive, this new development will mark another milestone in boosting the industry. 
The state now has 12 new coastal tourist locations, identified through a project funded by United Nations and the Centre.These new tourists sites have been identified along the 121 km coast of Sindhudurg, as part of the efforts to reduce excessive tourist traffic in the region. 
The new locations,within 10 kms from the coast, were scouted with fundings from United Nations Development Programme and the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change, and an interim report submitted to the state on October 30, 2016.
