Thousands of devotees thronging the cash-rich temple from various parts of the country continued to offer the junked currency in the hundi along with valid notes even after the deadline for exchange of demonetised notes expired on December 30. 
It is common practice for devotees of Lord Venkateswara to keep depositing cash in tiny boxes or mud pots kept in pooja rooms in their houses over a period, and then deposit it in the temple hundi whenever they undertake the pilgrimage to Tirumala.
