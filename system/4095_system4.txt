The Jammu and Kashmir government has decided to say goodbye to the practice of asking government teachers to be part of election duties. 
The move which has come as a sigh of relief is aimed at ensuring that the education system doesn't suffer and get distracted. 
After brainstorming and thorough deliberations, it has been felt that teachers should be allowed to concentrate on their primary goal of imparting education and for that they should be relieved of all other duties".The decision has been hailed by the teachers' community and the parents in equal measure.Most of the people have been complaining about this in the past.
