The aircraft, an Airbus A320 Neo, landed safely, GoAir said. 
This is the second incident involving a GoAir flight, where the plane had to make an emergency landing due to engine trouble. 
According to GoAir, the captain of its flight G8 329 from Mumbai to Delhi had sought priority landing from the Air Control Tower (ATC). 
"Due to a technical snag in the air bleed system, the flight commander had to reduce the power of the left engine and he asked for emergency assistance during landing," the airline said. 
Airline sources said the plane made an emergency landing.
