Bollywood actor Shahid Kapoor says his upcoming film Padmavati, marred by controversies, is made with a good intent.Shahid, who won the Big Zee Entertainment Award for the best actor  for Udta Punjab on Saturday, spoke to the media on the sidelines of the event.Talking about the controversies surrounding the historical drama, whose shooting was disrupted for showing a romantic angle between Rajput queen Padmavati and Alauddin Khilji, Shahid said: According to me, I have not shot any scene which has been changed. 
I had gone mad on Twitter after watching his last film (Bajirao Mastani), appreciating everyone, and never knew that I will be part of his (Bhansalis) next film, Shahid said.So, its awesome to be working with someone whose work I have admired in the recent past.
