After the scheme ended on July 14, property owners will no longer be given any leniency by the MCG and they need to pay their tax by August 31 or face the possibility of their establishments going under the hammer, officials said.Last week, MCG officials made an announcement that 20 buildings are to be auctioned next month after their owners failed to pay tax dues and the civic body sealed the buildings in February.The auctioning process was to start from May 20 but was deferred indefinitely and rebate schemes were introduced to ensure that maximum number of owners got a chance to clear their dues.
