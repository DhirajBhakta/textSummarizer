Peshawar, Dec 11 (PTI) A 29-year-old woman from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has become the first Pakistani female to join the Bomb Disposal Unit (BDU) in the restive province that frequently witnesses terror attacks. 
Rafia Qaseem Baig, who joined police force as a constable seven years ago, will work in BDU after completing her 15-day training along with 31 other male members at Nowsheras School of Explosive Handling, media reports said. 
However, she chose to join police force in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province when extremists were overtly targeting security forces. 
After her appointment, she was asked to undergo training sessions in areas including Adezai, Michni and Salman Khel in Peshawar, the capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.
