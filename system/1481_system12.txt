Jaipur, Jan 20 (PTI) Actor Rishi Kapoor has revealed he was not ready to do a scene in his father Raj Kapoors "Shree 420" and it was a chocolate bribe by Nargis Dutt that convinced him to do it. 
It was Nargis who came up with the idea to offer me chocolate to get the shot done. 
In that sense, I started taking bribes when I was two-year-old," Rishi said.
