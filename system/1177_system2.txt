Bajrang Dal activists do not believe in celebrating Valentine's Day, rather according to them it is against the Indian culture.This is not the first time that such warnings have been given to the youngsters, even last year the activists of this organisation assaulted and misbehaved with the youth on celebrating valentine's day.The activists believe that this is not Indian culture rather it is foreign culture that has been adapted by Indians which need to be stopped.
