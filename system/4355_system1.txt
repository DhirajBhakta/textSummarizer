Los Angeles, Mar 5 (PTI) Actor Warren Beatty has been praised for how he handled the Oscars Best Picture drama by the shows producer Michael De Luca. 
The 79-year-old actor and his "Bonnie & Clyde" co-star Faye Dunaway, 76, were given the wrong envelope at the Academy Awards last month, leading Faye to mistakenly announce "La La Land" as the winner, instead of "Moonlight". 
"If I was in that job, and I know Im Monday morning quarterbacking, which I detest, but I feel like if its my one job, if I heard the wrong name, Id walk directly to Warren Beatty and say you got the wrong envelope, heres the right envelope, and make a charming moment out of it."
