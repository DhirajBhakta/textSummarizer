This bitter truth was disclosed in an RTI response by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and 19 PSU banks. 
Stung by the revelation, the lawyer who had sought information under the transparency law has now moved the Competition Commission of India (CCI) alleging "cartelisation" and "anti-competitive practices" by the banks in respect of the locker service. 
Even under the RTI response, all public sectors banks have washed their hands of any responsibility.
