Due to space crunch, several students have been asked to stay in an adjacent building meant for associate professors. 
IIT officials said they have placed order for cots and 30-40 of them will be made available from Saturday.We have accommodated all undergraduate students in the hostel. 
Officials said even in 2016, a few students were asked to stay in temporary accommodation but were soon allotted hostels.
