Dozens of teen pregnancy prevention programs deemed ineffective by President Donald Trumps administration will lose more than $200 million in funding following a surprise decision to end five-year grants after only three years.The administrations assessment is in sharp contrast with that of the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, which credited the program with contributing to an all-time low rate of teen pregnancies.Rachel Fey of the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy said Tuesday that grantees under the Teen Pregnancy Prevention Program were given no explanation when notified this month their awards will end next June. 
The program, begun under President Barack Obamas administration, receives about $100 million a year.We know so little about the rationale behind cutting short these grants, said Fey, who said the teen birth rate has fallen by about 40 percent nationally since the program went into effect in 2010. 
It does not pay for or provide contraceptives.A Health and Human Services spokesman said late Tuesday that an evaluation of the first round of grants released last fall found only four of 37 programs studied showed lasting positive impacts. 
The program worked with more than 1,700 kids last year in high-poverty neighborhoods where the teen birth rates are three to five times the national average, she said.Most of the evidence-based programs are not just talking about contraception but are putting it in the context of bigger goals in life, such as, Where do you want to be in three years How does a kid fit into that, she said.Elizabeth Gomez, 44, said the Texas programs after-school classes taught her how to discuss difficult topics with her three daughters in a respectful way that made them listen and respond.For Hispanics, its difficult, because its a taboo to talk about sex, she said.A letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price signed by 37 Democratic senators called the decision short-sighted. 
As recently as July 3, people from the organization had been working with HHS officials about the details of the program, said Meagan Downey, the groups director of special projects. 
The grant covered about half of her salary.Downey said her organization was one of five grant recipients nationwide that lost their funding immediately. 
Others were given until July 1, 2018 to prepare for the loss of the funds.Leaders of the HOPE Buffalo program always had an eye toward establishing partnerships with city and community leaders that would enable its work to continue beyond the five-year lifespan of the grant, which provided $2 million a year, Project Director Stan Martin said.
