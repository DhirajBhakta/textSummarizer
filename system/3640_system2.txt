Hitting out at the Mamata government for renaming schemes, BJP leader Chandra Kumar Bose compared the West Bengal chief minister to Babur who "demolished a temple in Ayodhya and built Babri Masjid".STATE IS BEARING THE COST TOOThe reason for renaming schemes: The Mamata Banerjee government said that the state has to now bear 40 per cent of the total cost of implementing the schemes as against 10 per cent previously. 
The state government too is providing money for the schemes and therefore the schemes cannot only have the stamp of the Central government," she said. 
"All these Central government programmes have failed miserably in impacting and changing the lives of the common people in the country," he said.Senior Congress leader Omprakash Mishra said that both the Central and state government, including the one in West Bengal, have been renaming projects as well as policies. 
I think it is very foolish of Mamata Banerjee to change names and give a name at the state level for the same scheme which the Centre has actually adopted," the BJP leader said, adding that his party would "expose her (Mamata) bluff in the next election".ALSO READ:At NITI Aayog meet, PM Narendra Modi presents New India vision, Kejriwal, Mamata not interested
