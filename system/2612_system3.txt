Even as Indian and Chinese soldiers continue their weeks-long standoff in Doklam near Sikkim, a Chinese embassy official in New Delhi sought to allay fears of other Indo-Sino ties being hit. 
The "long-standing" economic and cultural ties that India and China share will not be hit. 
"Both India and China enjoy long cooperation as our lands are connected," news agency IANS quoted Li Rongrong, Second Secretary in the Economic and Commercial Counsellor's Office of the Chinese Embassy in India, as saying Monday. 
THE STANDOFFFor around three weeks now, the Indian and Chinese armies have been engaged in a non-violent standoff in Dokalam, an area that is disputed between China and Bhutan. 
The standoff was triggered after Indian Army soldiers attempted to stop the People's Liberation Army from constructing a road in the area. 
However, just today Chinese media again upped the ante, with the official China Daily newspaper warning that there will be "more serious consequences" if India does not withdraw its troops.
