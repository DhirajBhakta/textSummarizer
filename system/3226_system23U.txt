Ever since the trailer of Raabta released, fans couldn't help but draw comparisons between Sushant Singh Rajput and Kriti Sanon-starrer and the 2009 Telugu film Magadheera. 
And now a day after the makers of Magadheera approached the Hyderabad court to seek injunction against the release of Raabta, its makers have come in defense of their film. 
However, the producers of Raabta have denied the plagiarism allegation and said in an official statement, "We would like to, however, categorically reject even the remotest of suggestions that our film is a copy of Magadheera.
