But I feel that all actors go through hits and flops, it never makes me question myself, says Vidya, adding that she doesnt care about others opinions as  everyone is entitled to an opinion.    
#14thApril #2DaysToGo A post shared by Vidya Balan (@balanvidya) on Apr 12, 2017 at 3:03am PDT Unlike several other actors who get bogged down after a films failure, Vidya says shes not one of those who would run away or lock herself in a room and not talk to anyone. 
Will this one work or not I am just invested and committed.The 38-year old doesnt believe in carrying the burden of a flop film when she has started working on another project. 
Will this one work or not I am just invested and committed, and surrender to what I am doing because thats what I love the most.
