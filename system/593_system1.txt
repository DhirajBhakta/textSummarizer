The startup is inspired by this behvioural pattern that needs to be changed," said Sourav Panda, the founder of the startup, adding, it uses applied and social psychology, behaviour economics and choice architecture to spread the message of cleanliness.Official sources said Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, touted as world's biggest cleanliness programme, with nearly eight per cent of the total budget reserved for the behavioural-change component, but over last three years, the focus has been on building toilet infrastructure without the proper understanding of how people's mindsets can be changed towards their usage.Sources said nearly 60 per cent of the total toilets built under the mission are not being used as also unused toilets are being converted into storage spaces and thus causing huge loss to the public.Seventy per cent of all diseases diagnosed are related to sanitation.
