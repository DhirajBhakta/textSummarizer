Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said today that the cancellation of AAPs office allotment was part of a larger design to 'finish' the party. 
Kejriwal wondered why the Congress and the BJP, despite having negligible presence in the Delhi politics, have five and seven office spaces respectively, along with one plot each. 
"This must be the first time in independent India that a ruling party is being denied office space in the state where it is in power. 
People will teach them a lesson in the polls," he said "Having an office is our right. 
We will place a fresh demand for an office. 
People are already offering us space," he said. 
Meanwhile, party functionaries discharged duties as usual from 206 Rouse Avenue, the office space in question.
