gains: VHP New Delhi, Feb 21 (PTI) The Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) today said NDA constituent Shiv Sena was never a Hindutvavadi outfit and was pretending to be one only for political gains. 
Speaking to reporters here, VHP joint general secretary Surendra Jain said that merely chanting King Shivajis name does not make Shiv Sena a Hindutvavadi (one championing the Hindutva cause) party. 
Apparently referring to Shiv Senas sons-of-the-soil campaign in Maharashtra, particularly Mumbai, Jain said the party is rather a "fissiparous" force, which targeted its own Hindu brothers from south and north India for "narrow benefits" and does not understand broad concepts of Hindutva.
