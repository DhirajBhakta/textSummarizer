Fans have been waiting to see Bollywood's Karan-Arjun reunite on the big screen, and Kabir Khan's Tubelight was going to put an end to the wait by bringing Shah Rukh Khan and Salman Khan together in the same frame. 
He said at the film's press conference, "When Kabir (director Kabir Khan) narrated the subject to me, he said, 'For this role we should get Shah Rukh.' 
So, when I called him and I told him that there is a small role in Tubelight which I would like you to do it, before completing my sentence, Shah Rukh said, 'I will do it.'
