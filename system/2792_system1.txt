When you think of a beauty pageant as reputed as Miss Universe, you probably don't think that those who don't fit into the stereotype of beauty will be allowed to enter it. 
For the longest time, beauty pageants have been criticised for not accepting that beauty comes in all forms.

Add to that a birth mark across her neck and shoulders, and you have a woman who was bullied throughout her childhood. 
According to the Daily Mail, her classmates in school called her 'monster' and 'chocolate chip cookie', which left her heartbroken and shy.
