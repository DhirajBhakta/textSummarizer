WEST MOSULAfter crossing 12-13 security checks and driving through endless destroyed and uninhabited homes, India Today reached Hamadiya where Christians lived before the ISIS came.Brigadier Abdul Amin-al-Kazraji in-charge of the famous golden division told India Today that he holds India with regard but has no information on the missing Indians.Brigadier Kazraji provided India Today team with security to let it get to Badush prison where EAM Sushma Swaraj says that it is likely that the 39 Indians are still there.The India Today team was informed that it is still dangerous in West Mosul and that there are sleeper cells.THE FINAL MILEThe India Today team finally reached close to the prison where another local team is invited to facilitate us.The team of men lead the India Today team to a path full of mines and they watch their steps carefully to reach Badush prison where, as per the intelligence information that Sushma Swaraj has received, the abducted Indians could possibly be present.However, the information is absolutely incorrect because the building we are being told was destroyed by ISIS itself years ago and the area was liberated a few months ago by the counter-terrorism unit of Iraq. 
They did that with other hostages from East Mosul".While the brigadier refuses to comment on Indians, he provides us with a glimmer of that ever lasting hope that may be ISIS has taken them to Tal Afar.The Indian government is hoping for a miracle and so are we.CONGRESS TO TARGET SUSHMACongress will bring a privilege motion against Sushma Swaraj for allegedly misleading India on the 39 missing Indians.
