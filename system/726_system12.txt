A US gunship has killed at least 12 Afghan policemen in a friendly fire airstrike in Helmand, according to local officials.The incident is a setback for the US-Afghan fight against the Taliban in the embattled province, and comes as the US administration and its Nato allies are preparing the deployment of several thousand additional troops to Afghanistan.Since 2001, Helmand has consistently been the deadliest province for both foreign and Afghan forces.
