Ashley was not in court to hear the judge deliver his ruling, but his lawyers said he had won a comprehensive victory.In a statement, the businessman said: The only reason the Sports Direct share price exceeded ?8, and will hopefully do so again, is because of the sterling efforts of all the people who work at Sports Direct.Ashley, who gave evidence at the trial, said he could not recall making the alleged deal and if he had it would have been obviously just banter.He had told the court that he had met Blue, who was then an adviser to Sports Direct, and three other finance specialists at the Horse & Groom pub and consumed a lot of alcohol.I cant remember the details of the conversations that we had in the pub as it was a heavy night of drinking, Ashley had said.
