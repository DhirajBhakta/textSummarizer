BJP president Amit Shah today released the party's manifesto for the Uttar Pradesh Assembly election. 
The nine-part 'sankalp patra' promises a range of sops, ranging from free WiFi in colleges to steps to improve law and order. 
Predicting that the BJP will form the government in Uttar Pradesh with a two-third majority, Shah targeted the Akhilesh Yadav government, saying the law and order situation in the state is the worst in the world.
