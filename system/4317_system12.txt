West Bengal Education Minister Partha Chatterjee today said that around 100 schools were show caused following allegations of attempt to influence innocent minds through teachings that might promote religious intolerance. 
Chatterjee points out that many of these private schools get affiliation from different central boards of education and then take an NOC from the state, making it difficult for the state to directly act against them.
