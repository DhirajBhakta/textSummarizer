But, on Wednesday, when India Today asked Rajinikanth's contemporary actor and superstar Kamal Haasan on his political aspirations, the answer came as a brutal shock to many.In the interview to India Today's Rajdeep Sardesai, Haasan expressed extreme anger on the rampant corruption in Tamil Nadu politics for the last 60 years and the current uncertainty over leadership between VK Sasikala and O Panneerselvam. 
You are making it clear to the people of Tamil Nadu that Mr O Panneerselvam is not incompetent, and should be given a chance. 
I may be proven wrong, but I must speak now.Q: Do you believe the people of Tamil Nadu has been ill-served by? the political class which needs to recognise the needs and aspirations of the people?
