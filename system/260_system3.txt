Actor Emraan Hashmi has been in the Hindi film industry for almost 14 years, but the one film which he considers a career-changer was Once Upon A Time In Mumbaai (2010). 
I had worked with Kangana before this film, and Prachi and Randeep were amazing too. 
He says, The director Milan Luthria and the producers dared to take the risk, and had belief in the potential of the film. 
Before this, there had been landmark gangster films like Vaastav (1999), Company (2002) and Satya (1998), and I myself had rejected a lot of films based on the underworld, he says. 
He didnt even have a full script, but I was sold on the narration.
