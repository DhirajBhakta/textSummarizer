A 15-year-old girl was found to be seven-month pregnant after two of her cousins allegedly raped her several times. 
Police said they have arrested one of the accused, a juvenile, while the other is on the run. 
The incident, reported from a village in Sonepats Kharkhoda block, comes close on the heels of a series of similar incidents being reported from the state in the last two months.
