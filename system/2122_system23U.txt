Travel mania, solo travel especially, has just reached a whole new level. 
Delhi-based Nidhi Tewari had won a lot of gazes and praises when she drove from Delhi to London last year. 
On December 11 (Sunday), the 36-year-old will embark on yet another solo drive, of around 5000 km from the capital city to the middle of Siberia, reports Conde Nast Traveller.Nidhi will be driving through the chilling, frost-covered and extremely unpredictable Highway of Bones where temperatures can drop to as low as -70 degree Celsius.
