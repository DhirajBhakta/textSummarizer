And some wise heads are already gathering for the meeting...Jeremy Smith: The reality is that Englands best number three is still Jonathan Trott, a 36-year-old who retired from international cricket two years ago on health grounds.Zia Faruqui: Are Buttler or Morgan really the solution Surely both play in the same single devil-may-care mode as the current incumbents Need Hameed back.Neil Virani: Im quite amazed by people calling for Test players based on ODI performances. 
38th over: England 120-5 (Stokes 17, Ali 25) A rare quiet over for South Africa, Maharaj struggling manfully to stem the flow of runs ... then, after just a single ceded from the over, Moeen drives its final ball, Morkel keels over but cant stop it properly, and after some tricklage, England add four more.
