In a statement (see earlier) the recently elected French leader said he sent the British people Frances compassion and sorrow and pledged to continue working with Britain to fight terrorism.Frances prime minister, ?douard Philippe, condemned what he called the most cowardly terrorism that had specifically and clearly targeted young people going to a concert. 
The European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, has given this statement:It was with great sadness and profound shock that I learnt of the brutal attack that struck Manchester.It breaks my heart to think that, once again, terrorism has sought to instil fear where there should be joy, to sow division where young people and families should be coming together in celebration.I would like to convey my deepest sympathies to Prime Minister May and to the British people.Today we mourn with you.
