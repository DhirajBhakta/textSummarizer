She will essay the role of Sanjay's mother Nargis Dutt in the biopic directed by Rajkumar Hirani. 
But it's not easy to play Dutt's mother when she has worked with Sanju baba in a handful of films in the 90s. 
Koirala in an interview to Mid-Day opened up on signing the film and playing Nargis Dutt on screen. 
She told the daily, "When casting agent Mukesh Chabbra called me for it, my first reaction was, 'What I have to play Baba's (Sanjay Dutt) mother now' We have done several films (Yalgaar, 1991; Sanam, 1997; Kartoos, 1999).
