gains: VHP New Delhi, Feb 21 (PTI) The Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) today said NDA constituent Shiv Sena was never a Hindutvavadi outfit and was pretending to be one only for political gains. 
It is the media which gave this tag to Shiv Sena after Babri mosque was demolished," Jain said. 
Seeking to buttress his claim, the VHP leader stated late Shiv Sena founder Bal Thackeray himself was "clueless" about his party workers bringing portions of the mosque down in Uttar Pradeshs Ayodhya in 1992. 
Apparently referring to Shiv Senas sons-of-the-soil campaign in Maharashtra, particularly Mumbai, Jain said the party is rather a "fissiparous" force, which targeted its own Hindu brothers from south and north India for "narrow benefits" and does not understand broad concepts of Hindutva.
