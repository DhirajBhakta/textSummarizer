Going by that logic, this young man named Abdul Mannan will never again go near any cattle.On Sunday, 43-year-old Abdul Mannan was out and about in Kolkata's Tiljala area shopping for grocery. 
At one point, Mannan stooped over at a green grocer's stall to check out some cucumbers when calamity fell upon him.Only the calamity here was a calf. 
A living and breathing, 85-kg calf that fell out of the sky and on Mannan while he was shopping.Well, not 'out of the sky' per say. 
Reports have it that the calf was being kept tied up on the terrace of a four-storey building near the market were Mannan was shopping. 
Right at the moment when Mannan chose to stop under this building and shop, this six-month-old calf managed tear off the rope it was tied with and leap off the 70-foot high terrace.The next thing Mannan knew was that "something very heavy" had fallen on him.
