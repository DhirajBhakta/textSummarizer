My character kills a lot of people in the film, that doesn't mean that I will get inspired by him and start killing people. 
It was the love of the audience in their own way, I would say.Back in real life, do you sometimes approach a problem or situation asking yourself how Baahubali would have approached the same situationI never thought of it, but if Baahubali were to approach a situation or problem, he would just smile it off.
