With the release of Baahubali 2: The Conclusion a week away, Prabhas, 37, talks about the making of the Baahubali phenomenon, what his superhero status means to him and life after Baahubali exclusively to India Today.What was it like to play two different characters - Mahendra Baahubali and Amarendra Baahubali - both iconic and superheroes but with distinctly different personalities?
Part one focused more on introducing the characters, while part two is the resolution and offered greater scope for performance as well.Do you relate to the characters you played in Baahubali?
It was the love of the audience in their own way, I would say.Back in real life, do you sometimes approach a problem or situation asking yourself how Baahubali would have approached the same situation?
