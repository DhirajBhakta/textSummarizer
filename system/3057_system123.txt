A punter lost a whopping 70,000 pounds betting on a Tory majority, believing the election was "unlosable" for May. 
British bookmaker William Hill took the wager from an unnamed punter shortly after the Conservatives crushed Labour in Mays local elections. 
The person was one of many who apparently believed the upcoming general election to be "unlosable", the bookmaker was quoted as saying by The Independent.
