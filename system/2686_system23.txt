Mumbai, Jul 5 (PTI) Ratna Pathak Shah, who has played mother to Fawad Khan in "Khoobsurat" and "Kapoor & Sons", says she would like to see more participation across nations in arts and working with Pakistani ators is not an "insurmountable problem". 
Fawad, already a big name in Pakistan, became a heartthrob in India after his debut with "Khoobsurat". 
However, the clamour against Pakistani artists just before the release of his film "Ae Dil Hai Mushkil" prompted him to leave the country, ending his Bollywood career.
