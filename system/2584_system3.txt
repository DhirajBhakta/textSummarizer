Donald Trump Jr has been forced to release damning emails that reveal he eagerly embraced what he was told was a Russian government attempt to damage Hillary Clintons election campaign.The stunning disclosure raised questions over whether campaign laws were broken and why senior Trump associates failed to report a hostile act by a foreign power.Trump Jr also admitted on Tuesday night that he could have handled the situation better but he had not told his father about meeting a Russian lawyer because it was a nothing.The emails show music promoter Rob Goldstone telling the future US presidents son that the crown prosecutor of Russia had offered to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father.British-born Goldstone adds in the exchange of 3 June 2016: This is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its governments support for Mr Trump.Seventeen minutes later, Trump Jr welcomes this with the reply: If its what you say, I love it, especially later in the summer.In a later email, Goldstone describes the Russian lawyer they are due to meet, Natalia Veselnitskaya, as a Russian government attorney.Natalia Veselnitskaya is the Russian lawyer who met with Donald Trump Jr, Jared Kushner and Paul Manafort at Trump Tower on 9 June 2016.
