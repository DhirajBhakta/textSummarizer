The Maharashtra government filed an affidavit in the Bombay high court on Monday, justifying actor Sanjay Dutts early release fromYerwada Jail after he was convicted for his role in the 1993 blasts case.Advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni submitted the affidavit stating that Dutt displayed good behaviour, and discipline while in jail, participated in institutional activities such as physical training, educational programmes and performed all allotted work in accordance with prescribed standards thus earning early remission according to the statutory rules.The state allows a convict to earn seven days of remission a month if they follow the prison rules, and display exemplary conduct. 
Such remissions however, are not allowed while the convict is out of prison on parole or furlough.Dutt spent a little over a year and four months in jail as an under trial. 
However, the state rejected the application in December 2015.On February 25 2016, however, considering Dutts conduct, the state decided to let him out eight months and 16 days before he completed his five-year sentence.Dutt was convicted for illegal possession and destruction of an AK-56 rifle in 1993 serial blasts case.
