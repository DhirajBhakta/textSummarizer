Germanys highest court has ruled that ultra-conservative Muslim girls must take part in mixed swimming classes at school, finding against an 11-year-old pupil who had argued that even wearing a burkini, or full-body swimsuit, breached Islamic dress codes. 
The constitutional court noted that lower courts had found this to be untrue, and further found there were no binding rules in Islam to define appropriate clothing.
