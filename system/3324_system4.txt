The 46-year-old actor, who took a hiatus from films after being diagnosed with ovarian cancer, is all set to bounce back after 5 years. 
But it's not easy to play Dutt's mother when she has worked with Sanju baba in a handful of films in the 90s. 
Koirala in an interview to Mid-Day opened up on signing the film and playing Nargis Dutt on screen. 
I have to play Baba's (Sanjay Dutt) mother now?' 
I was always a tomboy on the set when shooting with Baba. 
I had my reservations as I would end up playing mother's roles. 
I thought to myself, when will I get to play Nargis Dutt again.
