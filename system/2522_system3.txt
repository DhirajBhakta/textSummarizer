Convict Afzal Guru hanged inside Tihar jail. 
Was a hangman brought from another state Or was it a jail staff who tied the noose It remains a secret because there is not a single hangman in Indias largest prison . 
Prison officials said though there is a post of an executioner in the prison manual ever since its construction in the mid 1950s, jail records do not show any name who has worked as one. 
Over the past years, the jail has received letters from the public offering to be executioners. 
They were aware that Tihar does not have a hangman and were willing to do the job, said an official.According to jail rules, any person who is mentally sound is eligible to be an executor. 
Sunil Gupta, who served as the law officer in Tihar for three decades, told HT that an executioners role is not a positive one.
