Refusing to give "an opinion on opinion polls", Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi today rejected the various exit polls that gave the BJP a clear lead in Uttar Pradesh and claimed his alliance with the Samajwadi Party is winning the state."
"I am not giving any opinion on the opinion polls," he said.In November 2015 Bihar election, most pollsters and pundits had predicted a Narendra Modi wave in Bihar and a BJP victory in the state. 
One of the TV channels had even called the election in favour of the saffron party, only to retract itself later when the Mahagatbandhan of the Janata Dal-United, the Rashtriya Janata Dal and the Congress had swept the state.On Friday evening, while the TV channels were busy discussing the exit polls, Rahul Gandhi's ally and Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav told the BBC that he is ready for an alliance with arch rival Mayawati's Bahujan Samaj Party in case Uttar Pradesh throws a hung verdict.
