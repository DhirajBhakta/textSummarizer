Sports minister Vijay Goel showed up after reading a Mail Today report on the dirty toilets, messy surroundings and swarms of mosquitoes at the arena that are proving to be a prickly problem for Indian and international wrestlers who have gathered for a championship.Goel visited each restroom, with jolted Sports Authority of India (SAI) officials in tow. 
Goel said a committee, looking after the utilisation of stadiums, will also scrutinise the cleanliness of the facilities."
The incident comes about three years into Prime Minister Narendra Modi's flagship Swachh Bharat Mission that aims to make the country clean and free of open defecation by 2019. 
Some said they have been forced to answer nature's call out in the open.Asked if he will form a task force to look into the matter, the minister said, "We are making efforts for better utilisation of stadiums. 
The same committee will also give report on such issues and on how the agencies here in such stadiums work."
The minister also directed that the SAI should not depend on organisers, but should look after the cleanliness work on its own.
