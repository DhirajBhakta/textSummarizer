The BJP today dismissed reports that the RSS had anything to do with the selection of hardliner Yogi Adityanath as the Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister and said it is unfair to criticise the decision without giving the Gorakhpur MP a "fair opportunity" to govern."
The RSS (Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh) never interferes with the selection of chief ministers," Union Minister M Venkaiah Naidu said a day after Adityanath took over as the 21st Chief Minister of the state.A number of the former or serving members of the RSS, which is the ideological fountainhead of the BJP, have been appointed Chief Ministers recently.
