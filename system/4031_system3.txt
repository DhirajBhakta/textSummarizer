According to IOC officials, the pipeline will get fuel from IOC's Barauni refinery in Bihar as well as Haldia refinery in West Bengal. 
Nepal wants to take that pipeline little forward to near Kathmandu which is about 70 kms more and has sought technical help from IOC, though the expenses will be incurred by Nepal," he said.Pradhan said a high level official committee has been formed to look into preparing feasibility of the pipeline as well as another LPG pipeline from Motihari to Nepal's Amlekhganj.
