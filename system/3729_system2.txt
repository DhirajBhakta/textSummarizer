Serena Williams is pregnant with her first child, her spokesperson has confirmed.The tennis star hinted at the good news when she posted a photo of herself on Snapchat wearing a swimsuit and revealing what appeared to be a large baby bump with the caption 20 weeks on Wednesday. 
The announcement left the sports chattering class wondering to what degree she was looking ahead to life after tennis.She answered that speculation with brio at the Australian Open, capturing her 23rd major singles title without dropping a set, to eclipse Steffi Grafs record for grand slam titles in the Open era and regain the No1 ranking she had ceded in the fall to Germanys Angelique Kerber.But she has been inactive since her win over elder sister Venus in the final at Melbourne Park. 
That enabled Kerber to retake the top ranking, though Serena is assured a return to No1 in next weeks table when the points from last years Porsche Grand Prix drop off.The announcement comes one week after Victoria Azarenka, the former world No1 and two-time grand slam champion, announced she will return to the tour after 14-month layoff that included the birth of her son, Leo, in December.Williams win at Melbourne Park made her the oldest player to win a major singles championship in the Open era, breaking a record she set herself last year  and again the year before that.
