The distributors, producers and filmmakers say they want to protect the interest of Pakistani movies as two big films, "Yalghaar" and "Shor Sharaba", along with others in the pipeline, are slated for an Eid release. 
Sohail Khan, the producer of "Shor Sharaba", said, "My film is supposed to release on Eid-ul-Fitr and if the government doesnt stall Tubelight, I will not release it as a mark of protest."
