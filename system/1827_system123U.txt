Instead of fishing for cash in their pockets to donate at temples, devotees can use  mobile phones to transfer donations to the e-wallets of the holy places. 
The priest at Shri Hanuman Balaji Temple in Gyan Khand-4 in Indirapuram has put up information on the donation box of the temple asking devotees to pay through Paytm. 
According to the temple priest, the move was initiated because the amount of donations fell after demonetisation was announced on November 8.When the note ban was announced many people donated old notes.
