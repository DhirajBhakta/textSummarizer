The organisers of the big-ticket show of David Guetta, one of the top disc jockeys in the world, cancelled his concert which was scheduled for tonight.The organisers cited law and order issues following the molestation incident during the New Year eve as the reason for scrapping the show, which was billed as one of the biggest events in the city's annual cultural calendar.The organisers said they hope to reschedule the concert if they get permission from the authorities and the artist but there is no clarity at the moment.
Guetta enjoys immense popularity in India and first performed in the country in 2012.The profits from the special charity performance at the gig, put together by the organisers of Sunburn -- one of the India's biggest electronic dance music festivals -- was supposed to go towards educating underprivileged children."
Music can change lives," Guetta had said in a statement last month.Best known as the big daddy of EDM, Guetta is on a four-city tour which was expected to begin from Bengaluru and then move to Mumbai, Hyderabad and New Delhi.Guetta first toured India in 2012, and has subsequently performed to massive crowds all across the country.
