Launching a scathing attack on Jawaharlal Nehru, BJP MP Subramanian Swamy told a packed house at the Faculty of Law at DU's north campus on Friday that the former Prime Minister's sole contribution to the Indian Constitution was the controversial Article 370. 
Swamy said Nehru was in London when the Constitution was being framed.Speaking in the context of the simmering Freedom of Expression debate that gripped DU, JNU and Jamia Millia Islamia recently, Swamy came down heavily on certain JNU students for 'inciting' trouble.The BJP MP took potshots at both Nehru and the Left dominated JNU campus, saying "Jawaharlal Nehru has left students of JNU as his political successors.""
They incited people against the state because Afzal Guru was hanged," Swamy said.
