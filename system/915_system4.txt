Hyderabad, Jul 18 (PTI) The reports of job insecurity leading to high levels of anxiety and depression among information technology professionals in India are baseless and exaggerated as there are no large scale layoffs, says a senior figure in the IT industry. 
Former Chief Financial Officer of Infosys, T V Mohandas Pai said such "exaggerated" reports are based on a few events and there are attempts to blow them up. 
"Just like earlier reports of layoffs, its (reports of anxiety and depression) totally exaggerated, fear mongering etc," he told PTI. 
The reports in a section of the press last week suggested that there has been an increasing deterioration of mental wellness among professionals due to job insecurities and they are undergoing issues such as anxiety and depression.
