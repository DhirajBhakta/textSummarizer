"We are making a century by launching over 100 satellites at one go," said S Somnath, Director of the Liquid Propulsion Systems Centre of the ISRO.That ambitious figure is an improvement on the space agency's statement last week that said it will launch 83 satellites in one go. 
With the addition of 20 more foreign satellites, the launch was delayed by a week and will now take place in first week of February, Somnath said.Of the 83 satellites planned earlier, 80 belonged to Israel, Kazakhstan, Netherlands, Switzerland and the US.
