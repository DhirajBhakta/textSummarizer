The app, created by US-based start up Socratic, allows students to learn how to answer a question just by snapping a photo of it. 
The app reads math questions - even handwritten ones - and gives students step-by-step solutions and explanations that teach them the underlying concepts and help answer all types of math problems. 
To build the app, the team looked through countless math questions asked by students and categorised them by the steps required to solve them.
