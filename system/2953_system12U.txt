West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee appealed for calm and peace after a weekend of violence in Darjeeling hills, where the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha is observing an indefinite shutdown. 
The protesters, who are pressing for a separate state of Gorkhaland, took out a large rally on Sunday with the bodies of activists allegedly killed in police firing. 
CM Banerjee, who left for the Netherlands today to address a United Nations meet, accused GJM of trying to create an "ethnic" divide in Darjeeling and said violence won't be tolerated.
