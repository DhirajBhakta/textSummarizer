Legendary Australian fast bowler Glenn Mcgrath, with whom Sachin Tendulkar had the fiercest of on field battles, is in Tendulkar's home turf Mumbai for a two day fast bowling camp. 
The second highest wicket-taker for Australia in Test cricket is the director at the MRF pace foundation and is conducting a short clinic at the invitation of the Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA).McGrath when quizzed about Sachin's son, Arjun, having fast bowling aspirations sprung up this response. 
"I know Sachin wanted to be a fast bowler when he was younger and had come to MRF. 
So may be...," he quipped recalling the well documented story of a 14-year-old aspiring fast bowler Sachin rejected by then MRF director Dennis Lillee.18-year-old left arm seamer Arjun, who has represented Mumbai Under-14 and Under-16, is still on the learning curve.
