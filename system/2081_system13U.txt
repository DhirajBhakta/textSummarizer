The UN has dropped the superhero Wonder Woman as an ambassador for empowering girls and women after a brief stint that drew widespread criticism.The campaign around the comic book character, who turned 75 this autumn, lasted for less than two months. 
More than 44,000 people signed a petition that claimed to have been started by concerned United Nations staff members which called on the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, to appoint a non-fictional woman to the role.It is alarming that the United Nations would consider using a character with an overtly sexualised image at a time when the headline news in United States and the world is the objectification of women and girls, the petitions authors wrote.Her scanty clothing  a shimmery, thigh-baring bodysuit with an American flag motif and knee-high boots  meant that deploying her as a role model for the UN was culturally insensitive in many parts of the world, the petition added.Wonder Womans tenure as an honorary ambassador was launched on 21 October with an event that saw a silent protest by audience members who turned their backs on the panel, which included current and former Wonder Woman actors Gal Gadot and Lynda Carter.Others protested in the lobby, holding up signs that said Im not a mascot and Lets get real.Diane Nelson, president of DC Entertainment, the Warner Bros subsidiary behind Wonder Woman, told the event the campaign would feature various initiatives over the course of the next year, suggesting that the partnership was envisaged to last into 2017.But now the UN has confirmed Wonder Womans time as an honorary ambassador will end this week.
