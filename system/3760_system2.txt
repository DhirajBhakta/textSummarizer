Kolkata, Apr 17 (PTI) The underwater tunnel of East-West Metro Corridor Project here, built below the Ganga river bed, is the first of its kind in the country, said Union Minister Babul Supriyo today after going into the tunnel. 
Further being built under Ganga, it has an emotional value as well," Supriyo, who went inside the tunnel between slab numbers 820 and 840, said. 
He has been asked by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to personally supervise the work, said Supriyo while interacting with the officials of Afcons-Transtonnelstroy of South Africa, the agency to build the tunnel between Howrah Maidan and the proposed Mahakaran metro station near Writers Buildings here. 
Expressing hope that the Howrah Maidan-Esplanade part of Phase II of the project, which would connect Howrah Maidan to Sealdah) will not miss the deadline, Supriyo said "We expect to clear the logjam in the wake of the existing rule that infrastructure projects would not come up within 100 m of the heritage buildings."
