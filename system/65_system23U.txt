It was last week that Kriti Sanon posted a video where she is dancing to a song from Mubarakan. 
Immediately Kamaal R Khan, the serial offender, posted a tasteless comment on the actor targeting the poor box office performnce of Kritis last cinematic outing, Raabta. 
Adding her voice to the chorus was actor Bhairavi Goswami who last appeared in Hate Story.Taking to Twitter, Bhairavi wrote, she is really behaving like a deranged woman.
