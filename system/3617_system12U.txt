India's criminalisation of homosexuality did not stop a Punjab police sub-inspector from marrying a woman and that too with full Punjabi style. 
Manjit Kaur, a sub-inspector in the Punjab Police, tied a knot with a woman and it wasn't a hush-hush affair. 
Reportedly, the wedding took place in the presence of their families, many classmates and colleagues of Manjit too were present at the ceremony.This is not the first time that a same-sex couple has gotten married.
