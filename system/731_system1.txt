Geet? 
I have been waiting to work with Imtiaz for the longest time. 
I remember watching Jab We Met in Bikaner with my parents and I felt this is an amazing film.?
Looking at the character of Geet (essayed by Kareena Kapoor Khan) I felt I should be doing films. 
I enjoyed collaborating with him for this film,? 
The actress said she prepared a lot to get the diction right.Anushka Sharma and filmmaker Imtiaz Ali during the trailer launch of Jab Harry Met Sejal.
Later I realised that he was such a big support system for me in my first film, he made things easy for me as a newcomer without making it obvious.
