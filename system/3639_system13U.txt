Actor Aamir Khan, who is known to give award functions a miss for the past 15 years (he last attended the Oscars where his production Lagaan was nominated in the Foreign Film category), made an exception on Monday evening when he was honoured at the 75th Master Deenanath Mangeshkar Award. 
In the presence of the legendary songstress Lata Mangeshkar, Aamir Khan was presented the prestigious Vishesh Puraskar for his film Dangal, by Mohan Madhukar Bhagwat, the current Chief, of the Hindu nationalist organisation Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS).
