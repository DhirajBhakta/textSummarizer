Exasperating farrago of distortions, misrepresentations&outright lies being broadcast by an unprincipled showman masquerading as a journalst," he wrote, sending half of Twitter scurrying to Google the meaning of "farrago" and make some sense of the clearly brutal tweet.Legendary memes and endless jokes were born, and Tharoor himself was pretty amused with the ripples he created.Thanks, tweeple, for finding humour in my exasperation!
