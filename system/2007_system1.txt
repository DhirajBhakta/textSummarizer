s parliament has passed a law allowing authorities to expropriate the house in which Adolf Hitler was born in 1889.The law, passed on Wednesday night, ends years of dispute between the building?
For years, Pommer refused to sell the building or allow it to be renovated.Pommer, who once ran it as a guesthouse and was compensated by the government with a generous level of rent to prevent it from becoming a lure for neo-Nazi tourists, is due to be compensated for the loss of the three-storey house with an undisclosed sum. 
But quite what the government plans to do with it remains unclear.While their main aim is to prevent the building becoming a shrine for the steady stream of neo-Nazi supporters who still make their way to Braunau, there has been an ongoing discussion over what more positive purpose it might serve.
