Superstar Rajinikanth's 2.0 landed itself in a fresh controversy when two photojournalists were allegedly manhandled by the crew members of the film.Now, director Shankar himself had visited Press Council office in Chennai to sought an apology. 
He said, "I am sorry. 
I shall ensure incidents like this don't repeat. 
It has happened without my knowledge."
According to reports, journalists have withdrawn a complaint filed against the film's production manager, a bouncer and Shankar's nephew.It all started when Ranganathan, a photojournalist, had questioned the crew members for shooting on broad daylight, when the permission was given only between 11pm and 6am. 
On the other hand, a bouncer had assaulted Sri Bharath, another photojournalist, on his face and alleged that he only tried to snatch the camera.
