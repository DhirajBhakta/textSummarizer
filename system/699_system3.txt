Congratulations on winning @RenaultIndia MTV #RoadiesRising @NehaDhupia pic.twitter.com/wZvbejRVTk MTV India (@MTVIndia) July 22, 2017I had auditioned for Roadies thrice in the past, but did not make it to the show. 
I took the challenge head-on and auditioned again, only with the intention of winning the show. 
Roadies is a cult show and being associated with such a show and winning it feels out of the world.
