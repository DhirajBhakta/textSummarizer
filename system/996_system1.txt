From a distance, this government-run Sanskrit school in Sikar district of Rajasthan appears like any other run-down school with the building in need of paint. 
But once you enter the premises, it becomes clear that something else is amiss. 
The school is erringly quiet ? 
there are no children on the small playground or, for that matter, in the classrooms.The Government Upper Primary Sanskrit School in Pratappura village has six classrooms, four teachers ? 
but not a single student. 
The teachers report for work at about 8am, water the plants, read newspaper, chat among themselves and leave after 2pm. 
They get their salary on time, but are not happy about the state of affairs.?
