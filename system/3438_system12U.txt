In what could have been a repeat of last month's Arjun Bhardwaj suicide, a 32-year-old woman lawyer attempted killing herself in Mumbai while live-streaming her life's final moments on social media. 
However, officials from the Mumbai Police who reached the location dissuaded her from taking her life. 
Maru was spotted on the 18th floor of an under-construction building in Mumbai's Sewri area by a resident of a nearby apartment.
