If Shah Rukh Khan agreed to do a cameo in Salman Khan-starrer Tubelight, the Bajrangi Bhaijaan actor has decided to return the favour by shaking a leg in one of the dance numbers for Aanand L Rai's next with SRK. 
If a report in BollywoodLife is to be believed, Shah Rukh has gifted a luxurious car to friend Salman as a thank you token for taking out time from his busy schedule to work in Aanand L Rai's next. 
A source was quoted as telling the website, "When Salman Khan came to shoot for the song, Shah Rukh surprised him by gifting him a brand new, luxurious car. 
But because he had managed his dates and agreed to shoot for the song on such a short notice, SRK wanted to gift him something to show his love and appreciation."
