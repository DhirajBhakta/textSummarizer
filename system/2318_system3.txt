Benghazis international airport officially reopened for commercial flights amid a heavy security presence on Saturday after a three-year closure due to fighting in the city.The first outward bound flights from Benina Airport were to the capital, Tripoli, to Amman, Jordan, and to the south-eastern Libyan city of Kufra. 
In recent months, some official and cargo flights had already been flying from Benina. 
There is also a military airport at Benina, which continued operating throughout the conflict as Haftars forces targeted their rivals with air strikes. 
Tripolis international airport was badly damaged by fighting in 2014, and flights have since operated out of the smaller Mitiga airport near the centre of the capital.
