 About 300 Ola and Uber taxi drivers have sought state BJP president Raosaheb Danves  support for their opposition to  provisions of the City Taxi Scheme 2017. 
The scheme was introduced by the Maharashtra government to provide a level-playing field for all types of taxis and curb surge-pricing.The drivers urged Danve to convince the state government to make changes to the scheme or scrap it. 
Issues raised in the drivers meeting with Danve included the price of cab permits, limiting operations of  cabs to within city limits, ban on diesel engines and conversion to CNG. 
Under the scheme, the state  has made it mandatory for  drivers using their vehicles for app-based taxi services like Ola and Uber, to register themselves with the transport authorities and follow several rules. 
Also, why should we paint our vehicles a different colour when we are the owners of our cars These are the issues that we need to discus with the chief minister, said Amarjeet Singh from the ACM.Ola and Uber drivers had moved to the Bombay high court in June challenging the City Taxi Scheme 2017.
