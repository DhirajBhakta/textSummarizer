Some states remained excruciatingly close, but the president was convinced of the outcome and did not want to question the legitimacy of the election as Trump had done just weeks earlier while facing off against Clinton in the debates.You need to concede, Obama told Clinton after his political director had failed to persuade Clintons campaign manager, Robby Mook, on the point.It took one more phone call from the president  to Clintons campaign chairman, John Podesta  before she asked her close aide Huma Abedin for the phone and uttered the words she never thought she would say: Congratulations, Donald.
