Actor Richa Chadha has never shied away from talking about how she struggled to make a mark in Bollywood without  a godfather. 
However, now that she has received recognition and a position in the industry, she wants to extend a helping hand to newcomers.?
s godmother right now, but I will do whatever I can to help newcomers. 
When I started in the industry, people had helped me; so why not extend that favour to others.I know how it feels  when people call you an outsider. 
says Richa, who has been part of the industry for nine years now with films such as Gangs of Wasseypur (2012), Masaan (2015)  and Sarbjit (2016) to her credit.
