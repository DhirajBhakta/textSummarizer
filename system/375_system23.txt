But, the policeman was hardly prepared for what followed next.The woman pulled him towards her, hugged him tightly, and started raining kisses on him.The other policemen sought help from another woman present at the spot, finally managed to extricate their colleague and take the three to the Bidhannagar South police station.The woman has been booked for rash driving under the influence of liquor. 
Cases have also been initiated against her two friends for misconduct.We may even start a case against the woman driver for trying to bribe a policeman by kissing him, said a police officer lightheartedly.
