It was last week that Kriti Sanon posted a video where she is dancing to a song from Mubarakan. 
Adding her voice to the chorus was actor Bhairavi Goswami who last appeared in Hate Story.Taking to Twitter, Bhairavi wrote, she is really behaving like a deranged woman. 
The crass tweet soon got a serious backlash on Twitter with many questioning who Bhairavi was.But the best reaction, by far, has been that of Kriti herself. 
Who is Bhairavi Goswami Kriti enquired.
