The scheme would be an accident insurance scheme with one year cover, renewable annually, offering accidental death and disability cover. 
The accident cover for the member would terminate on attaining the age of 70 years or closure of the account with the bank or insufficiency of balance at the time of renewal to keep the insurance in force, the official said. 
Similarly, if the insurance cover is ceased due to any technical reasons, the risk cover will be suspended and reinstatement of risk cover will be at the sole discretion of insurance company.
