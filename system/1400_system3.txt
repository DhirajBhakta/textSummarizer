The Labour MP Stephen Doughty says he wont vote for the article 50 bill.Given lack of Gov assurances, attempts to curtail debate + most importantly views of constituents, can't vote for Art 50 Bill or timetable.
He told the paper:It is safe to say that I am deeply concerned at the direction that Theresa May and the Conservative government is taking these negotiations, and the developments that are taking place.
