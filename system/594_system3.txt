As per SC  directions, the PGIMER has constituted an eight-member committee that would formally check if the health of the girl and the child would be adversely affected if the pregnancy is allowed to extend to its full term up to delivery. 
The child has crossed the time to abort the baby.Ten- to 12-year old children getting pregnant are rare cases. 
In the last five years, I have seen only two such cases; one mother was 10 and the other, 12, said a PGIMER gynaecologist.
