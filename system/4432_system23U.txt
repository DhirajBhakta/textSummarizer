The number of registered rape cases in Madhya Pradesh do not reflect the true picture of crime against women in the state, MP Home Minister Bhupendra Singh said on Tuesday."
We are sensitive towards women and have directed the police to register FIRs in all cases that are reported. 
So the figures may show a high number but the actual picture is something else as in many cases women either change their statement in court or retract allegations," Singh told India Today.On Monday, Bhupendra Singh in a written reply to a question asked by Congress MLA Ram Nivas Rawat in the state Vidhan Sabha said that 4,527 cases of rape were reported from across the state in the past one year.
