Washington, Jul 4 (PTI) Scientists, including one of Indian origin, have developed a smart headlight system for the first time that can help drivers see through heavy rain or snowfall and safely navigate roads during stormy nights. 
The light projection system then adjusts to deactivate light beams that would otherwise illuminate the particles in their predicted positions. 
"And because the precipitation particles arent being illuminated, the driver wont see the rain or snow either," To people, rain can appear as elongated streaks that seem to fill the air.
