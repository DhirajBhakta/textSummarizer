While Baahubali 2: The Conclusion is breaking records all over India and making a few abroad as well, back in Hyderabad, the film has enraged quite a few people.According to a report in The News Minute, members of a group called the Arekatika Porata Samithi filed a complaint with the Hyderabad police on Sunday against SS Rajamouli, the director of Baahubali 2: The Conclusion. 
The group which has lodged the complaint says that the term is a 'caste slur' and since they are from the Katika caste, the dialogue was 'humiliating their community name'.The group has also filed a complaint with the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) where it has demanded for the words to be removed."
