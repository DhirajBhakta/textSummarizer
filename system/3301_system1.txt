New Delhi, May 17 (PTI) Air travellers have voiced concerns over what they call lopsided measures in the no-fly list for unruly passengers and demanded airlines should also be held equally accountable for misbehaviour of their crew. 
The official said the governments intention is to have a balance, but added that those who gave feedback felt the draft rules were "tilted towards airlines". 
The first level of misdemeanor, which includes verbal harassment or physical gesture, carries a flying ban of three months.
