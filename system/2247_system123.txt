The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) proposes to hold the finals for classes 10 and 12 on same dates in two shifts, a move that will reduce the examination period and give teachers extra time to check answer-scripts more thoroughly.The new plan was designed after the board met principals of some of the top schools in New Delhi and its satellite cities.
