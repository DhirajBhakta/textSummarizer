The Supreme Court today said the Aadhaar card can't be made mandatory by the government for extending the benefits of its welfare schemes to the people.The apex court, however, said the government cannot be stopped from using Aadhaar - or the the unique identification number - in other schemes like the opening of bank accounts.Last week, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had said the Aadhaar card may become the only identity card in future, and will be mandatory for filing of Income Tax returns to curb tax evasion and frauds.Replying to the debate on the Finance Bill in the Lok Sabha, Jaitley said that Aadhaar may become the only card in future replacing all other types of identity cards such as Voter ID and PAN cards.The government has also said the Aadhaar card is a must for anyone seeking to obtain or renew a driver's license, a new telephone number as well as for existing connections to stay operational after February 2018.
