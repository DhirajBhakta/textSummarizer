Investigators, posing as iPhone customers, called all 13 Apple retailers across Australia in June last year.They told Apple staff their iPhone speakers had stopped working after screens were replaced by a third party.Apples response was the same in each of the 13 calls, the ACCC alleges.In each call, Apple Australia represented to the ACCC caller that no Apple entity ... was required to, or would, remedy the defective speaker at no cost under the [Australian consumer law] if the screen of the iPhone had been replaced by someone other than Apple Australia or an Apple-authorised service provider, the ACCCs court claim alleged.
