The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) is in the process of creating a network of food banking partners to collect and distribute leftover food from large parties and weddings to the hungry.A notification to create a separate category of food business operators (FBOs), who will be licensed to deal only with leftover food, has been drafted to ensure the quality of food.?
We are looking at partnering with NGOs or organisations that collect, store and distribute surplus food to ensure they maintain certain hygiene and health standards when handling food,? 
Collecting food going waste to feed the hungry is a noble thought but to transport, store and maintain the cold chain of cooked food is a huge challenge.
