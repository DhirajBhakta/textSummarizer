Taking in view the rise in attacks against women across the country, the Modi government has decided to augment capacity of states in investigation of crimes like rape, acid attack, dowry death and human trafficking by setting up 200 special investigating units after identifying the "most crime-prone districts".There were 34,651 cases of rape and 384 cases of acid attacks reported across India last year.
