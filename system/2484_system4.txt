Former Indian captain Sourav Ganguly on Saturday regretted taking off his shirt on the Lord's balcony after India's win in the NatWest triangular series in 2002 in England, calling it a mistake.When reminded of the incident, Ganguly said it was only a way of "relieving the pressure". 
When asked if marriage is akin to captaining India since the first five years are tough, Ganguly quoted actor Shah Rukh Khan, "As SRK says, end mein sab theek ho jaata hai," bringing the house down.The former Indian skipper also said a resurgent Team India will not buckle pressure anymore. 
Ganguly-led India lost to Australia in the finals of the 2003 World Cup in South Africa.Speaking in the session, 'Pressures of the World Cup', Ganguly remembered the loss, saying it was very difficult to captain India because of the huge expectations involved.
