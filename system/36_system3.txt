A woman parliamentarian of Imran Khans Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) has stirred up a major row by accusing the cricketer-turned-politician of sending her obscene text messages and harassing women leaders of the party.Ayesha Gulalai, elected to the National Assembly in 2013 from a reserved seat for women in the tribal areas bordering Afghanistan, also announced her decision to quit the PTI because she could not compromise on her honour and dignity.Addressing a news conference in Islamabad on Tuesday, Gulalai said the honour of women in the PTI is not safe because of 64-year-old Khan, whom she called a fake Pathan. 
There was no response to the allegations from Khan though PTI spokesman Fawad Chaudhry dismissed Gulalais allegations and claimed she had sold her soul for money.The lawmaker said she had received numerous text messages from Khan, and the first one was sent from his Blackberry in October 2013. 
She urged the Supreme Court to take notice of the matter for the sake of the honour of women members of the PTI as there is speculation that Khan might one day become the prime minister.
