s commission on election fraud to resume collecting detailed voter roll information from the states.The commission asked states last month to provide publicly available data including registered voters? 
The commission requested this publicly available data as part of its fact-gathering process, which is information that states regularly release to political candidates, political parties and the general public,? 
In addition, while Kobach has said that the effort was aimed at stopping voter fraud, his detractors say he is looking for a solution to a non-existent problem. 
The judge found that the group had standing to make that argument but said the commission was not an agency and therefore was not required to do such assessments.
