Washington, Feb 27 (PTI) NASA plans to send its first robotic spacecraft to the Sun next year that is slated to get within six million kilometres of the blazing star to probe its atmosphere. 
"We cant get to the very surface of the Sun," but the mission will get close enough to answer three important questions, Christian said. 
First, the mission will hopefully unveil why the surface of the Sun, called the photosphere, is not as hot as its atmosphere, called the corona. 
"You would think the farther away you get from a heat source, you would get colder. 
The scientists also want to know how solar wind gets its speed, Live Science reported. 
But we do not understand how that gets accelerated," he said.
