The works of art all bear the signature A Hitler, and are dated in the early 1900s, according to the Mullocks auction house in the UK. 
The paintings had been expected to fetch between 5,000 and 7,000 pounds each. 
The signed works included one depicting a rural lakeside scene; a water-colour painting depicting a church within castle; an oil painting showing a lake side house with mountainous background, and another water-colour painting of a town and river scene. 
The paintings were sold for 1,600, 1,500, 2,400 and 2,000 pounds respectively. 
An unsigned painting, that shows the grave of Hilters half-niece Geli Raubel and is widely thought to have been made by the Nazi leader, remained unsold.
