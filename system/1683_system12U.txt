Under the 'Z' category cover, which is the country's second-highest security categorisation, Singh will be guarded by 24 commandos of the central armed police, with protection also being extended to his home and office. 
The MHA late Saturday night ordered Central Industrial Task Force commandos to immediately take charge of Singh's security. 
The ministry's order did not mention a reason for granting the security cover, which, importantly, will only be available to Singh in Uttar Pradesh and not the rest of India.
