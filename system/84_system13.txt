If you drive a car in Delhi and its suburbs then bad and crowded roads are burning a big hole in your pocket.An ongoing study on how much fuel is wasted because of potholed roads and bad traffic has found that vehicles travelling on average, crowded roads consumed nearly one-and-a-half time more fuel per kilometre compared to good, fuel-efficient roads. 
The initial findings of the study conducted on two road stretches in Delhi have revealed that Delhiites could be consuming at least two-to-three times more fuel because of bad quality roads and traffic conditions, said Ravindra Kumar, principal scientist of CRRIs transport and planning division.The result is they end up paying more.A preliminary estimate puts the wastage across India at Rs 960 crore a day.
