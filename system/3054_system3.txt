The bank had argued that the matter was pending before different investigating agencies and disclosure of the information could hamper the investigation process. 
In its latest judgment in the case, the CIC quoted several judgments from the Supreme Court as well as the Delhi High Court and observed that the bank had to furnish information asked by Dhingra and that the exemption did not apply.IC Sharat Sabharwal observed: "Except for stating that the matter is under investigation of some agencies, the respondents (bank) have not made any other submission to justify invocation of Section 8 (1) (h) to deny most of the information and why its disclosure would hamper the investigation process. 
The IC also cited that the exemption clause itself made it clear that "a public authority may allow access to information, if public interest in disclosure outweighs the harm to the protected interests."
