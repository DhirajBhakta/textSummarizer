But I am proud to say that none of the tribal leaders have fallen for this gimmick.Rejecting the Congresss charge, the BJP countered tongue and cheek whether the rival lawmakers were purchasable.The Congress took the MLAs to the southern state, which it rules, after six of its 57 lawmakers in the Gujarat assembly resigned on Friday and Saturday.The defectors are believed to be close to former chief minister Shankersinh Vaghela, who quit the Congress on June 21, his 77th birthday, alleging that some party leaders were conspiring against him.The defections reduced the partys strength in the assembly to 51, but its Rajya Sabha nominee Ahmed Patel still has the numbers to sail through.Patel, the political secretary to Congress president Sonia Gandhi, will need the votes of 45 lawmakers.
