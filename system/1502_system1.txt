The Congress party may have opposed jalikattu with its full force but today it stands a divided house. 
Even as party chief spokesman Randeep Surjewala walks a cautious line there are leaders like Digvijaya Singh who outrightly support it. 
But what puts Congress in a spot is a letter accessed exclusively by India Today written by former Prime? Minister Manmohan Singh while in opposition expressing strong disapproval for this age old Tamil tradition that has become the focus of the country's polity now.The letter is dated December 15, 2015 when the Congress was in opposition and Dr Singh seized to be the Prime Minister.
