Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday launched BHIM-Aadhar pay app, that will allow people to make payments without using a smartphone. 
Instead, the app will enable payments through the fingerprint scanner, by authenticating the biometric details of a user with Aadhaar database. 
The app, which will be available for download to merchants across the country, will link your Aadhaar number and biometric fingerprint to complete a transaction.
