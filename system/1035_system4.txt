After drawing a lot of flak from former cricketers, Australia opener Matt Renshaw on Thursday finally gave his version of what really transpired on Day 1 of the Pune Test when he was seen leaving the field retired ill in the first session, just 15 minutes before the lunch break. 
Wriddhiman Saha flies to pull off a stunner)"Maybe five or 10 minutes before Davey (Warner) got out I asked Richard (Kettleborough, standing umpire) how long there was till lunch and he gave me the answer of 'half an hour' and I was struggling a bit then. 
(Dry pitch for Pune Test could play into Australia's hands: Shane Warne)"He (Smith) wasn't too thrilled about it but he understands that when you need to go to the toilet, you've got to go to the toilet," Renshaw said."
