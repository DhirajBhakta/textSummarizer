The Bombay high court on Friday criticised the Maharashtra government for its apathy towards students in its ashram (residential) schools in tribal areas. 
Terming the condition of such schools pitiable and ridiculous, a bench of justices RM Savant and Sadhana Jadhav said that the state had wasted time by constituting one committee after another but and had taken no steps to improve the infrastructure and facilities of these schools.The bench directed the secretary of the state tribal welfare department to file within three weeks a compliance report, including remedial measures, to improve the conditions of ashram schools in Maharashtra. 
It directed the state to provide basic facilities such as clean drinking water, mattresses, healthcare, toilets etc.These schools, meant primarily for children from tribal areas in the state, battle neglect and government apathy. 
The direction came while the bench was hearing a public interest litigation claiming that 793 children had died over the past 10 years in various ashram schools. 
The state government is obligated to provide basic facilities. 
The government must also appoint a female warden in each school that has girl students, the bench said.
