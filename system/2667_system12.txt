Union Ministry of Home Affairs has approved the renaming of two villages in Haryana, an official spokesman said here this evening. 
The Haryana government had recently changed the names of both villages on the demand of local residents who said they felt "embarrassed" with such names. 
Notably, a teenaged girl from Ganda (which means dirty in English), Harpreet Kaur Malkat, had written a letter to the Prime Minister seeking change of name of her village.
