The Late Show host, Stephen Colbert, a fierce critic of Donald Trump, has sold a new animated series to Showtime that will feature the cartoon commander-in-chief who frequently appeared on his show during last years election campaign.Colbert has teamed up with The Late Show show-runner, Chris Licht, on the project, which is currently slated for one 10-episode season set to air in the fall. 
Ive seen some of the footage, and I look forward to sharing the man behind the MAGA.The show will also feature animated versions of the presidents family members, featuring truish adventures of Trumps confidants and bon vivants  family, top associates, heads of government, golf pros and anyone else straying into his orbit, while intrepidly exploring their histories and their psyches, revealing insights into what makes them so definitively Trumpian.Colbert is among a litany of entertainers whove mined the White House goings-on for small screen comedy, including Anthony Atamanuik, who plays Trump in Comedy Centrals The President Show, and Saturday Night Live, which regularly features Alec Baldwins famed Trump impersonation alongside cast members and guest stars reprising their roles as various members of the presidents inner circle.David Nevins, the president and CEO of Showtime Networks, praised Colbert in a statement about the upcoming series: Stephen and Chris have an uncanny genius for deconstructing the world of President Trump, and this series opens a new realm for them.
