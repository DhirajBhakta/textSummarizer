From Prasoon Srivastava Barcelona, Mar 2 (PTI) The governments proposal to auction spectrum every year has got a backer in Bharti Airtel Chairman Sunil Bharti Mittal, who however has said there is no need for sale of airwaves in coming fiscal. 
He had said the government plans to provide industry with an option to buy spectrum every year irrespective of their interest so that there is never a shortage of spectrum in providing quality mobile services. 
Mittal recently pitched for affordability in spectrum pricing that has gone "out of control" in the last few years, saying the spectrum surplus industry will not need an airwave auction at least in 2017-18.
