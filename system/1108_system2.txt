The estimated worth of the drugs seized from the accused is around Rs 50 crore.The discus thrower, identified as Harpreet Singh, won a silver medal at the 2004 Commonwealth Youth Games in Australia and a bronze at the 2006 South Asian Games, before a foot injury cut his career short. 
Mephedrone is popular in parties and is used as a substitute for cocaine. 
Police claimed that their probe has revealed the drugs as smuggled from the African subcontinent to Mumbai and from there pushed into various Indian cities and even exported to other countries. 
A foot injury that he picked up before the Commonwealth squad selection ensured that he didnt make the cut, said the officer. 
The other two suspects had allegedly met in the United Kingdom while studying. 
The duo tried to find work there, but had failed and returned to India and got sucked in the drug trade.
