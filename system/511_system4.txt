#MissYou Papa... it's been #10 days since you left us, nothing can fill the void.. you always looked at me like you are doing in this picture when I was 5 days old taken outside the #armyhospital where I was born..Hope you are fine, hope you are free of pain, hope you still remember us, hope you are free in soldiers heaven where you always wanted to be when you crossed over.. 
s a day to celebrate nameless heroes just like my dad, who is no more, but he fought for our country and the legacy that he left behind is that of peace and security and self-sacrifice for the greater good for generations of Indians to come,?
