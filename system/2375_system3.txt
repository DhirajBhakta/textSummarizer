To control the alleged fraudulence in issuing of birth and death certificates, the East Delhi Municipal Corporation has decided to link them with the Aadhaar numbers soon.EDMC commissioner Mohanjeet Singh has on Tuesday directed the Information Technology department to chalk out the plan for speedy implementation of the project.Officials say requisition has already been sent to a private company (Tech Mahindra) for collecting data and initiating work on linking death and birth certificates with Aadhaar number. 
Similarly the Aadhaar/UID number of deceased/parents of the deceased/ spouse (if the deceased is married) need to be filled with application for death certificate, said a senior official from the public health department, EDMC.In Phase 2, we will start approaching the people, who have already been issued the birth/death certificates, to provide us the Aadhaar number. 
But no timeline has being fixed for accomplishing the data so far, he said.The officials also admitted that linking of Aadhaar card will ensure prompt availability of birth and death certificates in the jurisdiction, as all information can be accessed in one go.The decision has also been taken in the backdrop of a series of incidents involving stealing/ illegal issuing of birth and death certificates in North and East Corporations that took place in the last two years.In November 2015, the EDMCs website was hacked and 76 birth/death certificates were issued illegally. 
The initiative will help in avoiding duplicity as details of the person can be accessed with the help of one (Aadhaar) number, said Yoginder Singh Mann, EDMC spokesperson.
