In a boost to the Mumbai Metro, the Maharashtra government on Sunday approved bank guarantees and loan-related sanctions for four projects ? 
Metro 2A ( Dahisar to DN Nagar), Metro 2B ( DN Nagar-Bandra-Mankhurd), Metro 4 (Wadala Ghatkopar Mulund Kasaravadavali) and Metro 7 covering (Dahisar East-Andheri East). 
It has further decided to provide a debt sustainability certificate (DSC) to three other Metro projects ? 
The DSC is mandatory to sanction externally aided projects that are to get funding from multilateral agencies like the ADB and World Bank. 
Only after the loan agreements are inked, one can say the financing of these projects is complete. 
While civil work is being funded by the MMRDA, financing for the rolling stock, signaling systems etc is possible only through the loan.
