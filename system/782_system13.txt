Both the Senate intelligence committee and special counsel Mueller are currently investigating whether any coordination occurred between Russia and individuals associated with the Trump campaign.The possibility that the president is considering pardons at this early stage in these ongoing investigations is extremely disturbing, said Warner, the senior senator from Virginia and vice-chair of the intelligence committee.Pardoning any individuals who may have been involved would be crossing a fundamental line.The White House has yet to comment on the Post report.In an interview with the New York Times on Wednesday, Trump warned Mueller that some of his family finances should be off-limits to his investigation.Asked if Mueller looking at finances unrelated to Russia would be a red line, Trump responded: I would say yes.A move by Trumps legal team to look for conflicts of interest among members of Muellers investigative team was also reported by both the New York Times and Associated Press on Thursday.AP said two people with knowledge of the investigative process say efforts under way include exploring the political affiliations of Muellers investigators and their work history.Attorney Jay Sekulow, a member of the presidents external legal team, told AP that the lawyers will consistently evaluate the issue of conflicts and raise them in the appropriate venue.On Friday, White House aide Kellyanne Conway said it was only fair to expose any potential conflicts of interest of investigators helping Mueller examine Russias interference in the 2016 election and possible ties to the Trump campaign.Conway told Fox News Fox & Friends that members of Muellers team have contributed to Democrats Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama in the past.
