The Central Pollution Control Board is planning to develop a Delhi-specific driving cycle and location-specific air quality management plans with the money which manufacturers and dealers have deposited with it over the past one year as Environment Protection Charge, said a senior official of the CPCB. 
As the entire money was collected from Delhi-NCR as per directions of the Supreme Court, it would be spent solely to better tackle air pollution in the region only, said the official.
