As RJD chief Lalu Prasad left for Uttar Pradesh today to campaign for the Congress and Samajwadi party alliance in Raebareli and Amethi on Tuesday, he made scathing attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi calling him a dictator who was out to split the country in parts. 
Taking to Twitter, Lalu said Prime Minister of the country should not be speaking in a manner which belittles his stature."
Janab aap pradhanmantri ho, itni choti, aochi aur khoti baatein nahi karni chahiye", tweeted Lalu.Lalu's strong reactions came a day after PM Modi at a rally in Uttar Pradesh leveled charges on the Samajwadi party govt that they were discriminating with people in supplying electricity during festival of Eid and Diwali, a comment which Lalu believed was made to communalise the polls.
