Newcomer Kuldeep Yadav picked up four wickets on debut to help India skittle out Australia for 300 in their first innings on the opening day of the fourth and final Test in Dharamsala on Saturday. 
A fired-up Kuldeep then removed Peter Handscomb, Glenn Maxwell and Pat Cummins to enjoy his maiden outing in Team India whites at the Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association Stadium.
