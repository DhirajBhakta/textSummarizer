 The Noida authority has decided to paint road marks with an aim to streamline traffic movement on city roads.  
Once the road and lane marks are in place, they will help the traffic police in regulating the flow of traffic,? 
The project involves marking of zebra crossings, left-right turns, stop lines for vehicles and designated spaces for pedestrians, who often face problems negotiating traffic without adequate markings on roads. 
There are 112 traffic signals in Noida and the traffic police has 278 personnel at its disposal to regulate the movement of vehicles.The traffic police wants to make use of CCTVs to impose penalty on motorists violating traffic norms.
