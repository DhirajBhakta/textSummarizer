Here's some good news: We will soon have an opportunity to 'Dine with Royalty' during a three-day grand event organized by eatwithIndia, the group synonymous with promoting regional Indian cuisine by curating unique dining experiences, mostly at homes of people who are proud to showcase their family food. 
Six luxury tents would be set up, each representing the heritage of a princely state where members of different royal families will play host during the meal.
