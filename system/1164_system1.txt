New Delhi, Feb 14 (PTI) NHRC has received over 14,600 cases of bonded labour since its inception and this "anathema of civilised humanity" still persists in many sectors, chairperson Justice (retd) H L Dattu today said. 
"Bonded labour is one of the worst violations of human rights and also the dignity of life. 
It is a crime against humanity, anathema of civilised humanity, denial of inalienable human rights, antithesis of decent work and a blot on civilised society that jolts the conscience of the entire nation," he said. 
The rights panel chief also shared the number of complaints on bonded labour received by NHRC since 1993 and said it was "alarming".
