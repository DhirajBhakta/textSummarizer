Hizbul Mujahideen leader Zakir Musa has warned Hurriyat leaders that their heads will be chopped off and hung in the Lal Chowk in Srinagar for interfering in the militant group's "struggle for Islam".In an audio, which has gone viral on social media, Zakir is heard saying: "I am warning all those hypocrite Hurriyat leaders. 
If they do, we will cut their heads and hang them in Lal Chowk".The militant leader asserted that his outfit was clear in its motives of "fighting to impose a Shariat in Kashmir and not resolving the Kashmir issue by calling it a political struggle"."
