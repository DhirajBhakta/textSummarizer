Its a miracle, he told the Catalan radio station RAC1.Dal? is buried in a crypt beneath the museum he designed for himself in his home town of Figueres, Catalonia. 
His remains were disinterred to help settle a long-running paternity claim from a 61-year-old fortune-teller who insists she is his only child.Bardalet described the moment he had laid eyes on Dal?. 
His face was covered with a silk handkerchief  a magnificent handkerchief, he told RAC1.When it was removed, I was delighted to see his moustache was intact  I was quite moved. 
You could also see his hair.He said Dalis body resembled a mummy; it was like wood, adding that it was so hard that experts had to use an electric saw rather than a scalpel to collect bone samples. 
Bardalet predicted Dal?s body would last a good while longer. 
Abel claims she told her: I know you arent my sons daughter and that you are the daughter of a great painter, but I love you all the same. 
She also noted that her granddaughter was odd, just like your father.Under Spanish law, Abel would be heir to a quarter of Dal?s fortune if the DNA supports her contention. 
The Gala-Salvador Dal? Foundation, which controls the artists lucrative estate, had unsuccessfully sought to fight the exhumation by appealing against a judges decision late last month to let it go ahead. 
However, the results proved inconclusive.Another attempt to find DNA was made later the same year, using material supplied by the artists friend and biographer Robert Descharnes. 
Once the samples have been tested, they will be returned to Dal?s grave.
