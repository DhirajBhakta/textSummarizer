Box-office clashes have become inevitable in the recent past. 
And now fans are gearing up for another big clash. 
But Khiladi Kumar, who has been in the industry for over two decades now, is unfazed by the clash. 
In an interview to BollywoodLife.com, Akshay said, "Tell me a guy who doesn't have a clash? 
Clash is going to happen. 
There are 180 films that release every year and how many weeks are there? 
Clash is bound to happen." 
?This is not the first time that Akshay's film is facing competition at the box office. 
Last year, Rustom clashed with Hrithik Roshan's Mohenjo Daro, and passed the test with flying colours. 
From a quirky title to an interesting storyline to a fantastic on-screen pairing, the film has already raised expectations. 
The film stars Bhumi Pednekar alongside Akshay and is set to hit the screens on August 11 this year.?
