New Delhi, Jun 25 (PTI) Undue sympathy towards convicts by awarding inadequate jail term "undermines public confidence in efficacy of law", the Delhi High Court has said while upholding a 10-year term awarded by a trial court to a man for raping and trying to kill his ex-employers daughter-in-law. 
Dismissing the 45-year-old mans plea for reduction of his punishment, Justice S P Garg said that awarding inadequate sentences is a "serious threat" society which it would not be able to endure. 
"Undue sympathy to impose inadequate sentence would do more harm to the justice system to undermine the public confidence in the efficacy of law and society could no longer endure under such serious threat," the court said.
