The government of Maharashtra on Monday announced it would provide appropriate security to filmmaker Madhur Bhandarkar in the wake of the criticism he has attracted for making his latest movie Indu Sarkar.The security has been provided after a scheduled press conference of Bhandarkar in Nagpur was cancelled when Congress activists did not allow him to come out of his hotel. 
The film is set against the backdrop of the 1975-77 Emergency and apparently has characters inspired by the late Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and her son Sanjay Gandhi.According to media reports, Bhandarkar was put up at hotel in Nagpur on Sunday.
