With just 30% degree-college teachers reporting for paper assessment, the University of Mumbai (MU) will issue notices to teachers who are yet to start assessment .An official, who is involved in MUs assessment exercise, said the notice will inform the teachers the consequences of skipping assessment work. 
The university has prepared a list of more than 1,000 teachers from its affiliated colleges who will receive such notices, said the official.The Maharashtra Public Universities Act 2016 makes it mandatory for every teacher of the university, its affiliated, conducted colleges, community colleges and recognised institutions to assist the varsity in conducting examination and evaluation. 
The colleges are required to fill a proforma to indicate how many teachers they have and how many of them are assessing papers, said Anil Patil, director, academic planning, MU.The assessment work is mandatory for the teachers who have been appointed on permanent basis. 
The colleges must at least take the responsibility of evaluating the equivalent of their own students papers, said the official.While the university wants to get the teachers involved in assessment work, many of the teachers, especially those appointed on contract basis, are yet to receive their assignments from the university.
