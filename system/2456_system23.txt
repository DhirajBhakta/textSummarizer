 The city could soon get its second underground Metro line after the Colaba-Bandra-SEEPZ corridor. 
MbPT has conveyed to the MMRDA that it would like an underground line, but the final decision will be taken once the report is out, said a senior official.Officials added MbPT will share the project cost as the extension would help them get footfalls when port trust land is developed commercially.
