"As per bank records, two lockers were shown to be operated 12 times each, post demonetisation on different dates in November and December and all operations were found to be done by a single person who was acting as the authorised signatory," the source added. 
The CCTV footage in the bank showed big bags being carried in and out by the person who operated the lockers along with other same set of people accompanying him. 
The tax sleuths have brought to the notice of the bank authorities about the CCTV footage they "shows difference in time from the time shown in the bank records".
