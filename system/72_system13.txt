Rooting for equal pay for equal work, Swara says, I am not saying that if I, being a female actor, work for 10 days, I should expect the pay that an actor gets for 100 days of work. 
The actor, who has worked in films such as Tanu Weds Manu, Raanjhanaa, Prem Ratan Dhan Payo and Anaarkali of Aarah, asserts that even the roles being offered to female actors need to be at par with men.Although Swara agrees that things are slowly changing, she adds that there will be more progress only when female actors start being a little more assertive.
