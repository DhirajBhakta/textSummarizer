One man even tweeted the clip to the accounts run by the offices of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh.Rajya Sabha MP Rajeev Chandrashekhar on Friday tweeted the video to Delhi's Commissioner of Police Amulya Patnaik, and asked him to bring the culprits to book. 
He even requested the general public to come forward and help with any details possible.The Air Force hasn't yet commented on the video, which has surfaced just days after CRPF jawans returning from a polling station in Srinagar's Budgam were assaulted by civilians.
