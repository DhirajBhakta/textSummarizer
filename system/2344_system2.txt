The Uttar Pradesh civil aviation department has directed the Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (YEIDA) to immediately change the land use of 3,000 hectares of agricultural land for Jewar airport project, officials said. 
The UP government wants us to make necessary changes in our Master Plan 2021. 
The land that is shown for agricultural use now will be marked for the airport project in the master plan,? 
The YEIDA has also asked for a fund of Rs 2,000 crore and a dedicated team to begin land acquisition for the project. 
The national capital region planning board (NCRPB), which was formed by the Centre in 1985, to contain haphazard urbanisation in Delhi and its neighbouring towns  of Noida, Ghaziabad, Meerut, Bulandshahr and Gurgaon, among others, will have to approve the proposal for changing agricultural land use. ?
We will follow all procedures to change the land use for the airport project,?
