The drive, however, turned out to be one filled with horror and one that made Bharti fear for his and his family's life after a large group of people he identified as Bajrang Dal activists accosted them and made Bharti chant 'Jai Shri Ram'. 
On June 28, Bharti and his family were on their way to Rahimbad, a village in Bihar's Samastipur district located around 75 kilometers north east of capital Patna. 
Fearing for his and his family's life, Bharti goes on to describe how he immediately did what he was asked to, and chanted 'Jai Shri Ram' so that he and his family could escape from the spot alive.
