The drive, however, turned out to be one filled with horror and one that made Bharti fear for his and his family's life after a large group of people he identified as Bajrang Dal activists accosted them and made Bharti chant 'Jai Shri Ram'. 
Bharti says he and family joined the line of trucks that had been halted by people who seemed to Bajrang Dal activists. 
Having followed the men's commands, Bharti and his family quickly escape from the location, taking another route to Rahimbad.
