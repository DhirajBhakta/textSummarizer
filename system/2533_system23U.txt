The Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) is going to be history by the year 2025 if new buses are not inducted to its fleet.The corporation is in a major fix as 99% buses of its existing fleet of 3951 will have to be taken off roads in a span of over five years. 
We hope the process of procurement of 1,000 new buses is expedited, a DTC official said.The government has proposed to procure 1,000 new standard floor buses, but it would take at least a year-and-a-half until they are pressed to service.
