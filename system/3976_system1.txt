The aim of the project should have been cleaning the water and blocking the drains discharging sewage into the river, but that was not done," the chief minister said.LINK RIVERFRONT AND NAMAMI GANGE PROJECT: ADITYANATH Adityanath had asked officials to link the project with the Centre's Namami Gange project and start working to plug the drains discharging sewage into the river.He rued that the work was being carried out without keeping this in mind and instead, funds were being used on "unproductive" things such as erecting fountains and other decorative structures.Warning that his government would be firm in dealing with corruption and would not allow "loot" of government funds at any cost, the chief minister had ordered a review of the project within a week by the principal secretary of the department concerned to ascertain its actual cost.He'd also directed the principal secretaries of all the departments to review project works and check unnecessary expenditure, besides ensuring the completion of works in a "qualitative" manner.
