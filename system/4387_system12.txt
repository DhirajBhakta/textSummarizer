The National Democratic Alliance (NDA) has called for a state-wide dharna and protest to demand the ouster of Bihar minister Abdul Jalil Mastan, who called Prime Minister Narendra Modi a "Naxal" and a "Dacoit" at a Congress-organized Jan Vedna rally in Purnea on February 22. 
Mastan has since apologised for his comments.By calling for the dharna, the NDA has effectively stepped up pressure on Chief Minister Nitish Kumar to sack his ministerial colleague.NDA leaders have fanned out across the state, and will stage dharnas at all district headquarters.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has alleged that although Chief Minister Nitish maintains that he neither frames nor protects anyone, he's shielding Mastan and not expelling him from his cabinet.
