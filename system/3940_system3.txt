Despite protests by China, the 14th Dalai Lama today arrived in Arunachal Pradesh but will skip the famous Tawang monastery due to bad weather.The visit is opposed by China which considers Arunachal Pradesh to be a part of southernmost Tibet.His Holiness was greeted by chanting of prayers, music and religious flags with hymns and praises written on them. 
He then had to take the road route instead of a chopper which resulted in a change of plans.Hundreds of followers gathered in and around the entire Bomdila daring rough weather and heavy rainfall to catch a glimpse of the Tibetan leader in exile.He visited different monasteries including the Tibetan Monastery in Bomdila and is tentatively scheduled to stay there overnight.
