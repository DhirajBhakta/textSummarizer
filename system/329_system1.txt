The Election Commission is conducting free and fair elections.Earlier, Sharma had raised the issue through a point of order saying the Constitution was being violated by the ruling BJP which was using the police to abduct MLAs.They are stealing MLAs, he said, adding that it must be guaranteed that the biennial elections to the Rajya Sabha are free and fair and the abducted MLAs released.Union Minister Parshottam Rupala also sought to counter the charge saying it was an internal matter of the Congress whose MLAs, including the leader of the party in the Gujarat assembly, were deserting it.Why are you complaining here, he said, adding You are not taking care of your own house and are accusing us.
