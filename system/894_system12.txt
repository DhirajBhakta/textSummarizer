Donald Trump said Republicans should let Obamacare fail, after the dramatic collapse of efforts to repeal and replace Barack Obamas Affordable Care Act (ACA).The president spoke as a new plan to simply repeal the 2010 law with no replacement was in effect strangled at birth by a deeply divided party. 
I want this game plan explained to me, Ron Johnson, a conservative senator from Wisconsin, told reporters on Capitol Hill, refusing to say if he still had faith in McConnell.In a floor speech on Tuesday evening, McConnell said that he would hold a vote to open debate on a measure to repeal the ACA early next week, even though it is expected to fail.
