In a very surprising move the Maharashtra government's finance department passed a new resolution on the price limit for the car that is to be used by ministers and high ranking government servants for official uses. 
Interestingly the Chief Minister, Governor, Deputy CM, Chief Justice and Lokayukta can purchase any car of their choice and there is no limit on the amount of money they can spend.
