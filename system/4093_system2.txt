That's where real life heroes come in.After an apartment in Santa Monica, California, caught fire recently, somebody's pet dog got trapped inside the burning building. 
When firefighter Andrew Klein noticed, he climbed into the building and rescued the poor dog.However, the dog, who's called Nalu, was no longer breathing and didn't have a pulse. 
Nalu had been "overcome by heat and smoke," the Santa Monica Fire Department said in a statement.Klein, a fireman from the Santa Monica Fire Department, did not give up. 
"It was pretty amazing because I've been on a number of animal rescues like this that did not come out the same way that Nalu's story did," Klein told KTLA 5.
