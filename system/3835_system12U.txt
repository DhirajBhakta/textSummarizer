It might not be a Thursday, but Salman Khan's sister Arpita Khan was in a mood to share a throwback picture with her bhaijaan. 
Arpita took to Instagram to share an adorable picture from her childhood. 
Now a mother, Arpita looks almost unrecognisable in this old picture where she is seen hugging Salman. 
In fact, Sohail Khan also makes an appearance in the frame with his nerdy glasses.
