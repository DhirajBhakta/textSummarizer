Hope, the blue whale, takes over from Dippy, the dinosaur, as the centrepiece of the revamped atrium of Londons Natural History Museum on Thursday despite a spirited campaign to keep the much-loved attraction.The towering replica skeleton had been in the museum for more than 100 years and news of its impending demise in 2015 sparked an outcry from dinosaur fans who sent the hashtag #savedippy trending on Twitter.
