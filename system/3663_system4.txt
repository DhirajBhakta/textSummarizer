encounter sites: Official Srinagar, Apr 23 (PTI) Nearly 300 Whatsapp groups were being used to mobilise stone-pelters in Kashmir to disrupt security forces operations at encounter sites, of which 90 per cent have been shut down, a police official said today. 
Each of these 300 Whatsapp groups had around 250 members, the official said while explaining how determined attempts were being made to disrupt the operations of the security forces by mobilising stone-pelting mobs at the encounter sites. 
He said the governments policy of suspending internet services appeared to be showing positive results in curbing stone-pelting during encounters and cited the case of yesterdays encounter in Budgam district. 
He said some of the youth listed personal issues like alleged harassment by security forces as reasons for taking to stone-pelting.
