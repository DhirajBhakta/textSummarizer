Actor Tiger Shroff says though he likes to flaunt his dance skills and well-built body on screen, he wouldnt mind losing his muscular looks to play a boy-next-door character in the near future.Be it Heropanti or Baaghi, Tiger has showcased his action, dance and martial arts skills. 
Yes, I can do a lot of re-takes, but taking the extra struggle will help me to prove myself differently.After making his Bollywood acting debut in 2014 with Heropanti, he became a star.
