It was not in our plans to think that the permafrost would not be there and that it would experience extreme weather like that, said Hege Njaa Aschim, from the Norwegian government, which owns the vault.A lot of water went into the start of the tunnel and then it froze to ice, so it was like a glacier when you went in, she told the Guardian. 
We must see what we can do to minimise all the risks and make sure the seed bank can take care of itself.The vaults managers are now waiting to see if the extreme heat of this winter was a one-off or will be repeated or even exceeded as climate change heats the planet.
