Before the arrival of the baby, the two are busy spending some quality time together. 
Kunal took to Instagram to share a few pictures from their London sojourn. 
And soon enough, Kunal confirmed that the couple is excited to have their first child. 
Kunal told Pinkvilla, "Yes it's true. 
Soha and I are very happy to announce a joint production coming later this year - our first child! 
We feel blessed and thank you all for your good wishes." 
On the work front, Soha was last seen in the film 31st October with Vir Das.
