s most popular beach are all set to get a facelift. 
The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) earlier redid a 5-km stretch of the Juhu beach. 
While the first phase of the project faced opposition from some citizens and activists, Juhu residents said they welcome the beautification work.
?According to a plan proposed by BJP legislator Ameet Satam, each of the eight access points to the beach will have 5m high walls, bollards to restrict vehicles, ramps and steps with railings, welcome signs and a few lights.  ?
Steps and railings will make the beach accessible for senior citizens,? 
?While activists were unhappy with the plan to set up multi-coloured lights on the beach, they appreciated the BMC's effort to make the beach more accessible. ?
