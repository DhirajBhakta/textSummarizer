Joselu fired a venomous shot at goal in the first real attempt for either side, forcing an outstanding save from Ter Stegen to force a corner.The German let himself down a minute later, though, letting the ball slip out of his hands from a tame shot and Joselu gobbled it up to score from close range.Barca made the ideal start to the second half as Suarez instinctively drilled a loose ball under Lux to pull level, but they could not faze the home side, who soon set about restoring their lead.Alejandro Arribas rattled the post with a header and Deportivo were wrongly given a corner, which they took full advantage of as Bergantinos outmuscled Jordi Alba to head home.?
