We have decided to convert the heritage building of Gole Market into a New Delhi museum. 
						Besides photographs and other display material such as paintings, statues and literature based on the socio-economic, cultural and political aspects and conditions of pre- and post-independent period of the country, the contribution and sacrifice of freedom fighters would be also depicted in the museum. 
We are in touch with some organisations, government departments and individuals o procure rare items, an NDMC official said.Rare photos like the ones from the Delhi Durbar of 1911, in which the decision to shift the countrys capital to Delhi was announced and photos depicting construction work of Lutyens Delhi would be displayed in the photo exhibition gallery.There will be a documentary film section, which would act like a mini-amphitheatre where citizens would be able to see some documentary films and news reels related to Delhi.
