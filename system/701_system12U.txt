While the Sangh has advocated a policy of economic assault on Beijing by encouraging Indians to shun the use of Chinese goods and materials in daily lives, even in the process of praying, it has come up with a mantra to be chanted five times before prayers, be it a Hindu household's daily offerings to God or a Muslim's namaz.Even as the rejection of Chinese manufactures used in such daily affairs as household worshipping rituals is meant to attack the ubiquitous presence of China-made goods, thereby denying the neighbour one of the largest consumer markets in the world, it also aims to educate Indians in things they use without knowing them to be of Chinese origin.
