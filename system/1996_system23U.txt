 Three robbers looted  R 5 lakh from a cash van in east Delhis Pandav Nagar on Monday, the first such incident after demonetisation. 
The incident took place around 2:30 pm when the Brinks Security cash van had come to replenish an SBI ATM on Patparganj Road in E-block. 
Police said, Abdul Kadir, a cash custodian from the bank, took out a bag full of money from the van and was walking towards the ATM when three men on a bike snatched it from him.
