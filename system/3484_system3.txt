At one point, Mannan stooped over at a green grocer's stall to check out some cucumbers when calamity fell upon him.Only the calamity here was a calf. 
A living and breathing, 85-kg calf that fell out of the sky and on Mannan while he was shopping.Well, not 'out of the sky' per say. 
Right at the moment when Mannan chose to stop under this building and shop, this six-month-old calf managed tear off the rope it was tied with and leap off the 70-foot high terrace.The next thing Mannan knew was that "something very heavy" had fallen on him.
