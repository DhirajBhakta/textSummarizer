By Lalit K Jha Washington, Jul 18 (PTI) The Islamic State Khorasan (ISIS-K) has lost its hold in Afghanistan, days after the terror groups head Abu Sayed, was killed by US troops in an airstrike, the Pentagon has said. 
"His death will further disrupt the groups plans to expand its operations in Afghanistan," he said, adding that this is the third time in the past year that US forces in Afghanistan have killed a sitting leader of ISIS-K. 
"ISIS threatens America and the west because of its commitment to plot, direct and inspire terrorist attacks and its ability to recruit, move and finance the terrorists who commit these attacks," he said, adding that the terrorists have been very clear in their propaganda magazine and other publications, that they want to recruit and attack globally.
