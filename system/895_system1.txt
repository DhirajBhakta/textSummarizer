The friendship between Sachin Tendulkar and Roger Federer is well-documented, and India?
s Marin Cilic in straight sets in Sunday?
s final spoke of the mutual admiration, which extends to the virtual world as well.?
Roger follows cricket. 
Also, something which I learnt is that when Roger is playing video games, he prefers (to use) Sachin and when I am playing any racquet game, I prefer to be Roger,? 
When I go to Formula One, I get to meet great personalities who have achieved so much. 
s great opportunity to show our support for other sports; this is only about taking it to the next level.
