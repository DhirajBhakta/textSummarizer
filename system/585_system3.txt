Ourcq has reopened after it was temporarily closed due to higher than normal bacteria levels following weekend rains.The floating structure that has been put in place for the summer has allowed Parisians to legally swim in the canal at La Villette for the first time in decades. 
It is thought that heavy rainfall at the weekend had led to the higher than normal readings of bacteria levels.Tests are regularly made at a point upstream from the swimming area to ensure the water quality is within guidelines. 
After a 10-year effort by the city to clean up the canal water, regular tests had consistently come back with satisfactory results showing the bacteria levels were far below accepted limits.
