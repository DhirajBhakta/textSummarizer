 The Prime Ministers Office has paid around Rs 89 lakh to the Indian Air Force for flying Narendra Modi on 128 non-official domestic trips since he took office, an expense that was lower than what it would have been had the PM used through commercial providers.The trips were largely for electioneering, and Indias election code makes it must for ministers  including the PM  to reimburse the government if its machinery is used in such cases. 
The rates for these flights were last revised by the defence ministry in 1999.In all, the IAF provided details of 128 non-official flights taken by the PM from May 2014 till February 2017, when Modi was on a whirlwind tour of election-bound states that included Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, Maharashtra, Haryana, Jharkhand and Assam, the Right to Information reply provided by the air force to Commodore (retired) Lokesh K Batra said. 
The disclosures could cause some unease among Bharatiya Janata Partys rivals, who can claim that the lower rates put the PMs party at an advantage with respect to election spending.In his application, Batra asked the IAF about the domestic visits by the PM and the mode of payment. 
The reply said the rates were last notified in 1999.The PMO paid the air force Rs 31,000 for a Delhi-Gorakhpur-Delhi flight and Rs 7,818 for Mangalore-Kasargod-Mangalore flight, which private chartered airline operators said was lower than the commercial rate.
