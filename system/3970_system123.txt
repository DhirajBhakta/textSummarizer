Mumbai, Apr 2 (PTI) Banker Uday Kotak feels there will be strong consolidation in the financial services sector and eventually only five players will dominate the space just like in the global space. 
When asked about if e-wallets will succeed, Kotak said, "to some of those models, you need to ask the question- how will you get stickiness and ultimately monetise" Advocating a faster push on growth, Kotak said he is getting the vibes of an uptick in growth.
