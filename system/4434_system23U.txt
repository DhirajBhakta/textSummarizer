Varanasi, Feb 28 (PTI) Rashtriya Janata Dal supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav today sought to liken BJP-led NDA governments last November demonetisation decision with infamous mid-1970s Emergency-era phenomena of forced nasbandi (sterilisation). 
"It was not notebandi but nasbandi, carried out by the Modi government on crores of people, who were forced to stand in queue for withdrawing their own money from the banks," said Lalu, launching a scathing attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
