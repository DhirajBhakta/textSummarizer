All arrangements were made even as Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), which is entrusted with security of all Indian Airports, allegedly behaved indifferently.Union minister Sripad Naik, local party chief Vinay Tendulkar and minister Mauvin Godinho were present in the public meeting. 
In a very strongly worded letter that India Today is in exclusive possession of, Rodrigues wrote, "It constitutes act of unlawful assembly as defined in section 141 (IPC) by which not only mischief has been caused but also other people who were arriving at or departing from the airport, were restrained by the blockage due to the public meeting".Rodrigues not only demanded that an FIR be registered against the organisers but also all dignitaries including Amit Shah.
