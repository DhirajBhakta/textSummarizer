Vishwas is also attending the PAC meeting at 11 am.Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Kumar Vishwas on Tuesday accused a section of party colleagues of conspiring against him and said he will take a decision tonight, potentially hinting at quitting amid raging dissension in Delhis ruling party.Within hours of the announcement, Sisodia criticised Vishwas for speaking only to the media, indicating the leaderships disapproval of the poet-turned-politicians public statements.Vishwas sparked the crisis in the AAP after he challenged the partys stand blaming electronic voting machines (EVMs) for the defeat in the recently held municipal polls.A few days later, another AAP leader Amanatullah Khan  the Okhla legislator  described Vishwas as an RSS agent and accused him of conspiring to take control of the party, led by Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal.Kejriwal is struggling to keep the party together after a series of election setbacks, including the drubbing in Punjab and the municipal polls.On Tuesday, a teary-eyed Vishwas said Amanatullah Khan was just a mask used by some AAP leaders to attack him.And then I realised this is not being said by an MLA (Khan)...he is only a mask and someone else is speaking behind him, Vishwas said.Vishwas also blamed a coterie within the AAP for its election reverses but did not elaborate.Though Vishwas said he will not join any other party, he kept his options open for leaving the AAP.I dont want to become the chief minister, deputy chief minister, convener of a party and neither do I want to join any other party....
