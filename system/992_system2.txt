#MyDaddyStrongest 55 @suniel.shetty A post shared by Athiya Shetty (@athiyashetty) on Aug 10, 2016 at 11:04pm PDT His daughter Athiyas maiden film Hero, which featured another newcomer- Sooraj Pancholi, was not a blockbuster. 
I am indebted to Salman Khan (the producer) and Nikhil Advani (director).Athiyas next film Mubarakan is releasing two years after her debut but Shetty has said he is not worried about the long gap between and appreciates Athiyas patience and choice of movies.
