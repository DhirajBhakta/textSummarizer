It was?a set of two enormous hands, emerging out of a canal to support the historic Ca'Sagredo hotel.This huge pair of white hands has actually been put on display as part of the 2017 La Biennale di Venezia, an annual exhibition.Titled 'Support', the sculpture has been created by renowned artist Lorenzo Ouinn. 
Built off-site, the hands were then loaded on boats and carried to their present location by Quinn and his team. 
This spectacle of artistic brilliance is imbued with a deeper significance. 
Quinn writes on his Instagram page that Support will preserve Venice, ''the wonder of city that is threatened by climate change.''
