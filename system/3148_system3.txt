The waters of Venice got a new installation on May 13 and guess what It was?a set of two enormous hands, emerging out of a canal to support the historic Ca'Sagredo hotel.This huge pair of white hands has actually been put on display as part of the 2017 La Biennale di Venezia, an annual exhibition.Titled 'Support', the sculpture has been created by renowned artist Lorenzo Ouinn. 
The hands are approximately 9m in height (27ft) and weigh approximately 2500kgs each (5,800lbs, informs Quinn through his Insta post.
