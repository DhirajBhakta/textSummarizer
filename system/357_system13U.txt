Separated in childhood, twins, Karan and Charan (both played by Arjun Kapoor) are expected to marry as per their guardians wishes, but they are already in love with Sweety (Ileana DCruz) and Nafisa (Neha Sharma).Things get complicated when Charan gets engaged to a another girl, Binkal (Athiya Shetty) in London. 
The shy guy couldnt gather the courage to tell his parents about his love life and that leads to a big-intra family feud that ends when Charans uncle swears to marry him off in exactly one month.However, Kartar Singh (Anil Kapoor) is yet to arrive and add more confusion to the already-messed up affair.Mubarakan is a typical Bazmee film which starts with loud background music and solid bass.
