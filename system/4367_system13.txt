From Aditi Khanna London, Mar 5 (PTI) Tata Steel may be considering breaking off talks over a planned merger of its European business with German conglomerate Thyssenkrupp, a UK media report claimed today. 
The merger talks had been revealed by the Indian steel giant last year as part of a major restructuring of its UK steel business. 
The deal has been slow moving as Tata Steel tries to solve the problem of its own 15-billion-pound British steel pensions scheme.
