A party leader privy to the development said Ram Lal, national general secretary (organisation) of the BJP, had asked the state leadership to expand its base among young females, especially those who stay at home. 
Following Ram Lals instruction, state unit chief Manoj Tiwari has directed its Youth Wing (all 14 district presidents) to carry out an identification drive. 
The members of the Youth Wing have been asked to prepare a list of women in the age group of 18-25 years and are willing to work for the outfit.
