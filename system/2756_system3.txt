Nagpur, Jul 1 (PTI) Union minister Ramdas Athawale today said the ICC Champions Trophy final between India and Pakistan appeared "fixed" and demanded a probe into the matter. 
"Those who did not perform should be rested and eligible cricketers from the Dalit community should be given a chance in the team," he said, adding the RPI(A) demands 25 per cent reservation in cricket and other sports for Dalits and tribals. 
On the GST roll out, Athawale said the new tax regime was a revolutionary step taken by the NDA government.
