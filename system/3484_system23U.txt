Going by that logic, this young man named Abdul Mannan will never again go near any cattle.On Sunday, 43-year-old Abdul Mannan was out and about in Kolkata's Tiljala area shopping for grocery. 
At one point, Mannan stooped over at a green grocer's stall to check out some cucumbers when calamity fell upon him.Only the calamity here was a calf. 
A living and breathing, 85-kg calf that fell out of the sky and on Mannan while he was shopping.Well, not 'out of the sky' per say.
