The debt-laden company - which offers landline and mobile telephony services in Delhi and Mumbai areas - said it will be able to make the repayment due to "one of the public sector banks", a few days before the June-30 deadline. 
Stating that about Rs 495 crore of long-term loan will come up for repayment in the current financial year, Purwar said the telecom PSU is confident of meeting its obligations in this regard. 
Purwar, who recently met the interministerial group (IMG) on financial stress in the telecom sector, has been seeking "government support" for availability of Rs 8,000-10,000 crore capital over a period of time.
