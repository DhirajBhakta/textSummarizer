Donald Trumps new communications director has launched an extraordinary, foul-mouthed tirade against two senior colleagues, raising the prospect of all-out civil war at the White House.Anthony Scaramucci told an interviewer that the chief of staff, Reince Priebus, was a fucking paranoid schizophrenic who would be asked to resign, and that Scaramucci was not like Steve Bannon, the chief strategist, because Im not trying to suck my own cock.The profane language was shocking even by the standards of the Trump era and suggested that a major staff shake-up is imminent.The New Yorker correspondent Ryan Lizza wrote that Scaramucci called him on Wednesday night, angry that Lizza had tweeted that the communications director was having dinner at the White House with Trump; his wife, Melania; the Fox News host Sean Hannity; and the former Fox News executive Bill Shine.Who leaked that to you Scaramucci demanded, according to Lizzas account.
