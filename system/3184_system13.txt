Hyderabad, May 30 (PTI) Employees unions are not needed in information technology industry where work ethic is good and the staff are well-paid with techies even finding opportunities outside the company they work for, says a senior industry figure. 
"But I think even if there is a union, I dont think it will impact the industry much because IT industry is one of the best paymasters in the country and second, the people find opportunities outside", he said.
