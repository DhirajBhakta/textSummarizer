Delhi Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) chief and MP Manoj Tiwari today had breakfast with slum dwellers of Samaypur Badli. 
Breakfast is just a gesture, I am making notes about the problems of the area. 
Work is here where I am standing (in the slums)... 
Work cannot be done from air conditioned rooms."
He also requested the Delhi Chief Minister to join him in making slums a better place to live.
