The Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), has decided to do away with the procedure to speed up the check in process from April 1. 
The BCAS had in February issued an order announcing that the procedure was to be done away with but the CISF had at that time object to immediate implementation of the plan. 
The cycle of security check will speed up and our staff will get more time to check suspicious baggage,? 
These modifications were required to make sure that passengers could not access bags containing restricted items which are segregated by CISF personnel for checking. ?
High Definition CCTV cameras focussed on the baggage screening system were required so that CISF personnel who cleared a bag could be easily identified to fix accountability,?
