As per government figures tabled in parliament during the budget session, nearly 27,000 children have gone missing in Delhi in the last five years and only 9,700 could be traced.Across the country, 30 per cent of the children remained untraceable, but in Delhi the number is the highest - 63 per cent.INITIATIVES LAUNCHED? Bhagat said police have launched a scheme, "Pehchaan: Safeguarding the Childhood", as part of its anti-human trafficking drive.Under the 'Pehchaan' initiative, children belonging to poor families residing in JJ clusters and resettlement colonies are being registered and photographed from time to time with the district police "so that they can be traced if they happen to go missing in future", Bhagat said.Bhagat said the "situation is alarming" in the capital and "sometimes it is difficult to trace missing children since poor families do not even have photographs" of their children.Thus beat constables have been tasked to capture photograph of all kids in slum areas, he said."
