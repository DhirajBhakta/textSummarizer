Each one of us is a custodian of India's well-being and of the legacy that we will pass on to coming generations.- The armed forces that protect our borders and keep us safe are nation builders.- Those police and paramilitary forces that fight terrorism and crime are nation builders.- That farmer toiling in the blazing sun to feed fellow citizens is a nation builder.
