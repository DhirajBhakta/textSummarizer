I am doing different kinds of characters and they are not chosen on the basis of a particular message to give in a film. 
Whichever script I find exciting, I take it up. 
It came to a stage where I started hating action films. 
I did an off-beat film like Sangharsh (1999), which everyone called a great film, but it didn?
I did a film 8 x 10 Tasveer (2009) but not even 4 by 5 people came to see it in theatres (laughs). 
Thankfully, I got a lot of chances to prove myself but (breaking an image) it?
I just know what I want to do.
