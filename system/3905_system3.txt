The Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation on Monday issued guidelines to the Swachh Bharat Gramin Mission and all the states affirming that the transsexual community should be allowed to use the public toilets of the gender they wish to.The attempt by the Ministry is a deliberate effort to recognise the community as equal citizens who can use one of the the basic facilities provided by the state, which is a place to attend nature's call.According to the Ministry's circular, which entitles the transgender community to use the public toilets of their choice, many from the third gender group can even volunteer to Swachhta drive and to recruit transgender people to help promote sanitation around the country. 
"Wherever suitable, their support can be enlisted in engaging communities, and their efforts duly recognised and honoured to break any stigma around them and also to enable them to use facilities without any embarrassment," the circular said.While on the other hand, Donald Trump has revoked Obama's guidelines that directed public schools to allow transgender students to use the bathrooms of their choice.
