Rashtriya Janata Dal Chief Lalu Prasad Yadav's daughter Chanda Yadav paid a paltry sum of Rs 5,000 to become one of the owners of a posh bungalow in Delhi's elite New Friends Colony. 
Her brother Tejaswi and Ragini were the other two owners.An investigation by the Income Tax department into the alleged benami transactions of Lalu's children for buying properties in Delhi has revealed that AB Exports, the firm that purchased the bungalow for Rs 5 crore, was a shell company.
