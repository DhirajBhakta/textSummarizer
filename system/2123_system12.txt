The Centre rejecting the request made by Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar to provide flood relief assistance to the state to deal with the post-flood situation has directed the Bihar government to first spend the funds it has under State Disaster Fund before seeking any kind of central assistance.It may be noted that the Bihar government at present has Rs 1,859 crore in the State Disaster Fund and the Centre has directed it to spend this amount first as relief and rehabilitation for flood victims and compensation to farmers for crop losses.
