water worries are likely to be taken care of.Thane residents will be saved from intense water cuts next summer, as ?Barvi?dam that provides water to most cities in the district has now filled up to 99% of its total capacity ? 
The height of the?dam?was increased by the irrigation department last year, owing to which the water stock is much more now.Last week, the dams providing water to Mumbai had overflown but the ones in Thane district were yet to reach their capacity. 
The water stock will ensure that only nominal water cuts of 5 to 10% will be imposed in the summer, which will not hurt residents.?
