Ever since Schwarzenegger took over as the host of The Celebrity Apprentice from Trump, the latter has been criticising him for the show's poor ratings.In fact, when the actor announced that he will not return as the host for a second season, Trump tweeted, "Arnold Schwarzenegger isn't voluntarily leaving the Apprentice, he was fired by his bad (pathetic) ratings, not by me. 
Sad end to great showWhen Schwarzenegger was on the radio show, The Michael Smerconish Program, why the president is so fixated on him, the actor replied, "I think he's in love with me."
Apart from the 69-year-old actor, Trump has also taken on a host of other Hollywood celebrities, including Meryl Streep and Kristen Stewart.
