I know who I am as a person and I think that most realistic people will look at me and know who I am.Cheered on by supporters whose spirits were not dampened by a near-two-hour delay, McGregor goaded the 40-year-old Mayweather with taunts about his age, appearance and rumoured tax bill.He remarked that four years ago he had fought in front of only 400 people at a small venue in London, adding this is my first time in a boxing ring and in six weeks Ill rule boxing.Mayweather was booed as soon as he took the microphone and endured a hostile reception from the pro-McGregor crowd throughout his performance.The tour became a verbal battle that people were scoring and I didnt anticipate it being so back and forth, McGregor said.If we are going to score it then lets do that  I smoked him on all four rounds.While the money generated by the clash in Las Vegas is expected to eclipse the previous record held by Mayweathers victory over Manny Pacquiao, its credibility has been questioned.McGregor, who turned 29 on Friday, is a boxing novice and is facing a man regarded as the finest boxer of his generation.They call that jealousy.
