Midnapore (WB), Apr 30 (PTI) A West Bengal BJP leader today described Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee as a eunuch, while accusing her of practising the politics of appeasement. 
While addressing a party meeting at Chandrakona in West Midnapore district, the partys state committee member Shyamapada Mondal alleged that Banerjee has been doing what Muslims do as their religious practice. 
I would say she has become a hijra (eunuch) as you see them in trains and buses," he said amid laughters by party supporters.
