Actor Aamir Khan, who is known to give award functions a miss for the past 15 years (he last attended the Oscars where his production Lagaan was nominated in the Foreign Film category), made an exception on Monday evening when he was honoured at the 75th Master Deenanath Mangeshkar Award. 
"It's a huge respect that we've got, Nitesh Tewari - the director of Dangal and me", said Aamir at the ceremony, in Mumbai. 
A film starts with a writer, and the respect that we've got across the nation is all thanks to Nitesh's hardwork. 
I have achieved success and immense love from all my fans, thanks to those writers and directors who've written and made my films.
