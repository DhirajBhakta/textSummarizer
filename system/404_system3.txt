Tired of doing the rounds of the dealers store or the licensing office to get your new car registered You can just sit back and relax now as the registration certificate (RC) for your car will soon be delivered right at your doorstep.Starting next week, the Delhi government is going to put in place a new system in which RCs will be delivered at the vehicle owners residence via speed post. 
This system would remove the contact between the dealers and the licensing officers as all documents will collectively reach for dispatch and there shall be no preference given to anybody, a transport official said.Vehicle owners will also get alerts through SMS about the status of their RC.
