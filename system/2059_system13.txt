When a Flipkart delivery man arrived to deliver a smartphone to 22-year-old Varun Kumar, he was murdered. 
Nanjundaswamy, a Flipkart employee in Bengaluru, went to a gym to deliver a smartphone but Varun was apparently waiting there with a knife. 
Varun, a gym trainer, ordered the phone online and gave the gym as his address, but since he did not have Rs 11,999 for the Redmi Note 3, he decided to murder the delivery man.
