Then on Tuesday morning Trump will meet Abbas in Bethlehem before flying on to Rome.Speaking at his weekly cabinet meeting on Sunday, ahead of Trumps arrival, Netanyahu said: I will discuss with President Trump ways to strengthen our primary and steadfast ties with the United States. 
What noises that have emerged from reported leaks about Trumps plans to advance peace suggest an implausible mishmash of ideas  including the idea that Israel be allowed to continue settlement building during talks.On the Israeli side the most significant outcome is a proposal for improving the economic quality of life for Palestinians on the West Bank, including longer opening hours for the Allenby Bridge crossing to Jordan, more building permits in the so-called area C and suggestions for new industrial zones on the West Bank.Lacking any clear prospects for a breakthrough, the runup to the visit has been dominated by mini  and sometimes concocted  controversies including the comment by a US official telling Netanyahus office that the Western Wall was not in Israeli territory.Trump will, however, become the first US president to visit the wall, a fact that was being spun last week by Jonathan Schanzer of the rightwing US Foundation for Defence of Democracies as a pro-Israel step.I think that if Trump himself goes to the Western Wall and does it with Israeli officials, even Israeli security, theres going to be very little argument over who controls it  certainly [when] going there to acknowledge it as a Jewish holy site, said Schanzer.On the Palestinian side, officials appear content that the worst predictions regarding Trump on the Middle East  fuelled by his own campaign rhetoric  have not materialised.
