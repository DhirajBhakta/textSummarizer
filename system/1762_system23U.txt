 A day after chief minister Arvind Kejriwal criticised Delhi metros move to allow cashless transactions at 10 stations through Paytm, the decision was revoked on Monday evening.Over the counter cashless transactions have been deferred till we re-examine this issue, the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) said in a statement. 
Metro officials said application of e-wallet companies such as Paytm in the present form is not suitable to be used in the metro system due to large volume of transactions it handles on a daily basis.On December 23, the DMRC had announced it would launch a special drive from January 1 wherein all its over-the-counter transactions would be cashless at 10 stations.
