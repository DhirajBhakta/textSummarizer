AAP leader Atishi Marlena, while addressing reporters at the party office on Thursday  a day after Deoli MLA Prakash Jarwal got anticipatory bail in an alleged molestation case  hit out at Delhi Police for invoking stringent sections of criminal procedure, despite being in the know that the complaints are politically motivated. 
Marlena cited the bail order, which struck down molestation charges, in Jarwals case to buttress the partys charge.
