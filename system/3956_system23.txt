Condemning the recent attacks on their students in Greater Noida, a group of African envoys have accused India of taking no action against the violence, which they said was "xenophobic and racial" in nature."
India took no action to prevent violence against Africans. 
It didn't properly condemn the Greater Noida attack," the African envoys said in a statement. 
"No known, sufficient and visible deterring measures were taken," it added.Calling the attacks "xenophobic and racial", the envoys said they expect strong condemnation and action from India. 
"These reprehensible events, both outstanding and unresolved cases against Africans, were not sufficiently condemned by the Indian authorities," they said.At least two incidents of attacks on Nigerian students were reported from Greater Noida last Monday following the death of a Class 12 student, who allegedly died of drug overdose.In another attack the same evening, caught on camera, a Nigerian student was brutally beaten by a large mob inside Greater Noida's Ansal Plaza mall.
