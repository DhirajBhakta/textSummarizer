There has been a lot of negative comment so far, comparing Trumps move to previous US incursions in the Middle East, but little concrete information about the potential consequences, as people wait for a signal from the Kremlin on how Russia is going to play this.The Pentagon has said there were multiple conversations with Russia before the strike, and that extraordinary precautions were taken not to target Russians at the base, but we are also yet to hear anything from either the Kremlin or military HQ on how these discussions looked from Moscow.A report on the state news said the US had launched the attack after baseless claims that Assad had used chemical weapons.
