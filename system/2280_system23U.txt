Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Mehbooba Mufti on Saturday accused China of meddling in the troubled state that has recently witnessed a spike in violence. 
The chief minister was speaking to reporters emerging from a meeting with Union home minister Rajnath Singh with whom she discussed the security situation in the state. 
Militants have stepped up attacks in recent months on government forces in the state as counter-insurgency operations intensify.
