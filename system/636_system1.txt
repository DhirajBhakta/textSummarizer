In a boost to the Mumbai Metro, the Maharashtra government on Sunday approved bank guarantees and loan-related sanctions for four projects  Metro 2A ( Dahisar to DN Nagar), Metro 2B ( DN Nagar-Bandra-Mankhurd), Metro 4 (Wadala Ghatkopar Mulund Kasaravadavali) and Metro 7 covering (Dahisar East-Andheri East). 
This will also ensure that work on the Metro projects is not held up for want of money.We plan to complete Metro 7 and Metro 2A by the 2019 Assembly elections.
