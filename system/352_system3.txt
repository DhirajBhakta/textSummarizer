However, we are managing the security of the national Capital with the low strength and so we want more such dogs for foolproof security of the city. 
Such functions are on the radar of anti-national elements and so security of these venues is a top priority.The dogs could play a vital role in keeping these events safe. 
Since all 60 dogs are not fit for the job round the clock, Delhi Police want an adequate number of canines in the squad so that security personnel do not come across a shortage."
