Snooty, the worlds oldest known manatee, died on Sunday at his Florida home, a day after celebrating his 69th birthday.In a statement, South Florida Museum chief executive Brynne Anne Besio said Snootys death appeared to be a heartbreaking accident and added that staff were devastated.In a press conference from Bradenton broadcast on Facebook on Sunday afternoon, museum provost and chief operating officer Jeff Rodgers said Snooty died after becoming stuck in a maintenance hatch leading off the tank he shared with three young rescued manatees, Randall, Baca and Gale.The hatch is big enough for a 1,300lb manatee to get in, Rodgers said. 
It appears that he was not able to get himself back around to get himself out of the situation.Asked if Snooty had drowned, Rodgers said the manatee had been taken for a necropsy, the results of which were not yet known. 
The three young manatees were not injured, he said.The necropsy will be carried out by Snootys veterinarian of more than 20 years and the Florida fish and wildlife conservation commission.Besio said: Were all devastated about his passing. 
We are working with them as well, with the emotional situation, theyre actively caring for the three rehab manatees today so life goes on for those manatees  Were just making sure our manatees and our staff are well cared for.Snooty was born in captivity in 1948 and came to the South Florida Museum the following year.
