A girls school is banning wearable activity trackers and smartwatches because of concerns that pupils are skipping lunch if they fail to meet their calorie and exercise targets.Teachers at Stroud high school in Gloucestershire fear the gadgets are exacerbating some girls worries about their body image. 
She said: With young girls its very difficult to say if something will lead to an eating disorder or not; using things like Fitbits can just be a cool thing for them to do.I think I agree with it, but I do have reservations over whether it will actually prevent anyone from getting a disorder if they are on that path anyway. 
When pupils return from their summer break, girls in years 7 to 9 will be banned from using their mobile phones at all during the school day.Those in years 10 and 11 will be allowed to use their mobiles at lunch, and pupils in the sixth form  which includes boys  will be allowed to use their phones freely except in lessons.
