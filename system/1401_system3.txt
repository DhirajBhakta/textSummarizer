Delhi Metro is running out of colours and how.The capitals most favoured public transport network is scouring the palette for six new lines which will have to be colour coded, officials of the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation told HT.The nine existing lines of the Delhi Metro  used by an estimated 30 lakh commuters daily  is identified by a different colour, a method used to help people remember their ride easily. 
We will definitely give distinctive colours to new lines that are coming up. 
We have an architect department which will come up with the new colours to be allotted to these lines, a DMRC spokesperson said.The six new lines will cover 104km, crisscrossing the existing network and is expected to have a daily ridership of 8.5 lakh. 
Besides, Delhi metro also uses some of the tertiary colours, a mixture of the primary and secondary colours.DMRC has so far used red, yellow, blue, green, violet, pink, magenta, grey and orange.Some of the colours which the DMRC could use include rose, vermillion, azure and even black, though it is considered inauspicious by many in India.Officials said primary colours were used for phase I lines, secondary colours for phase II lines and for phase III (new lines), tertiary colours are chosen.
