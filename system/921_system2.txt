We will also help the companies set up food processing units, enable them to export the products and set up mechanism for effective marketing, said agriculture minister Pandurang Fundkar.The decision was taken in the backdrop of the decline in the land holding per household to 1.44 hectares in 2010-11 from 4.28 hectares in 1970-71. 
The total estimated loan to be disbursed in two years for the scheme is Rs 2,604 crore.The state government had made it compulsory in June 2015 for sugar factories in the catchment areas of eight dams (including Tembhu, Mujla, Bhima, Kanholi Nala) to switch to drip irrigation from flood irrigation till June 2019. 
The interest subvention scheme not only enable the farmers to swtich to drip will also help them in raising production per hectare, Fundkar said.The minister said the new scheme will replace the existing subsidy scheme which cost government about Rs350 crore a year.
