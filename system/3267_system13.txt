An official of the Indian High Commission, however, said that the mission does not have any information about the arrest so far.The arrest came days after the International Court of Justice stayed the execution of Indian national Kulbhushan Jadhav, who was sentenced to death by a Pakistani military court on charges of "involvement in espionage and sabotage activities" against the country.The "suspicious person" has been booked under the Foreigners Act, 1946.
