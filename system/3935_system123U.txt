Former Congress MP Sandeep Dikshit has launched a frontal attack on colleagues Ajay Maken and PC Chacko accusing them of running the Delhi unit of the party like a "business house".Talking to India Today on phone, Sandeep Dikshit alleged that Delhi Congress president Ajay Maken was indulging in cheap acts. 
"What is happening is Delhi is unfortunate," he said.Dikshit's offensive comes hours after former Delhi MLA Amrish Gautam quit Congress and joined the BJP while former Congress minister AK Walia threatened to quit over ticket distribution for the civic polls.Dikshit said those quitting Congress at this juncture would lose his sympathy.
