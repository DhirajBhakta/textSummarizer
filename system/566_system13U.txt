Ditching a lavish car, brand-new Indian President Ram Nath Kovind took the historic buggy ride from Rashtrapati Bhavan to Parliament for his the oath-taking ceremony today.Outgoing President Pranab Mukherjee was seated on the left side of the buggy and the new president on his right. 
On their way back, once Kovind has taken his oath, the two will exchange seats, leaving Mukherjee on the right and Kovind on the left.This buggy has interesting history at its tail.
