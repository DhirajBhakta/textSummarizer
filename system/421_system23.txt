A section of Jawaharlal Nehru University students have accused the administration of imposing Hindi on them after the university made it compulsory to fill the MPhil and PhD submission form in Hindi and English.Till last year, students could fill the form in either of the languages.The students were going through their last hour of submission of M.Phil/Ph.D dissertation/thesis today. 
Students were severely harassed for filing an online tracking form which should contain title of the dissertation in Hindi, said Satarupa Chakraborty, JNU students union (JNUSU) general secretary.She said that on the verge of submission, those who neither speak Hindi nor have learnt to write Hindi, had to run from pillar to post to find someone who could write their dissertation title in Hindi.
