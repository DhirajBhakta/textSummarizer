A Russian television journalist was punched in the face live on air Wednesday as he reported on raucous annual celebrations by paratroopers in Moscow.  
Nikita Razvozzhayev, a correspondent with the pro-Kremlin NTV channel, was extolling the professionalism of Russias airborne forces when a bearded man staggered up to the presenter and began an expletive-laden rant about invading Ukraine. 
The annual paratrooper holiday regularly brings drunken bedlam to city streets and parks around Russia as former and current members of the elite units cut loose.
