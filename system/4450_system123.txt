Maharashtra's bar dancers have waltzed up to the Supreme Court and argued that the prevailing ban-like atmosphere in the state could push them into activities like prostitution.Members of the Bharatiya Bar Girls Union knocked on the SC's door on Monday against the "unjust and arbitrary" new restrictions such as curbs on body movement, ban on acceptance of tips and showering of money as well as serving of liquor in performing area apart from mandatory installation of CCTV cameras.They reminded the court that the closing down of the bars in 2005 left over 75,000 female workers unemployed.
