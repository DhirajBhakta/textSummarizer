However, it cannot take advantage of the delay to scuttle an inquiry, the court said.Our constitutional jurisprudence does not permit us to shut the door on such persons and our constitutional obligation requires us to give justice and succour to the next of kin of the deceased, it added.The court also dismissed the Centres argument that the affected families were compensated.This cannot override the law of the land, otherwise all heinous crimes would get settled through payment of monetary compensation, the bench said.It asked the government not to reduce the National Human Rights Commission into a toothless tiger but obey the panels suggestions.The respect and dignity of the dead and the human rights of all of us will remain only on paper unless the commissions guidelines are followed, the bench said.Human rights activists in Manipur welcomed the top courts directive but also sounded a note of caution about the composition of the investigating team.It is too early to celebrate, said Babloo Loitongbam of the Human Rights Alert that along with an association of families filed a petition in the Supreme Court in 2012 on the extra-judicial killings.Advocate and human rights activist Rakesh Meihoubam recalled the case of 12-year-old Azad Khan, allegedly shot dead in front of his parents and villagers, and a handgun planted at the site to label him a militant.
