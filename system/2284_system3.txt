JP Morgan just had the most profitable 12 months ever for a US bank  but it wasnt enough for Jamie Dimon, the banks boss.Its almost an embarrassment being an American traveling around the world and listening to the stupid shit Americans have to deal with in this country, Dimon told journalists after the bank released its latest quarterly results on Friday.The worlds largest bank reported a profit of $7.03bn for the second quarter, 13% higher than last year. 
He blamed bad policy for holding back and hurting the average American and financial journalists for concentrating on the banks trading results when they should be focusing on policy.Who cares about fixed-income trading in the last two weeks of June I mean, seriously, Dimon said after a reporter asked about the health of the bonds markets.That is the weather, he said of changes in the markets. 
While Dimon clearly favours cuts to regulation, he argued: Some regulations quite clearly create a common good (eg clean air and water).Dimons letter was written as Trump began his attempts to dismantle Barack Obamas legacy of environmental protections.Dimon also worried about the impact of poorly conceived anti-trade policies and wrote that it was alarming that so many talented immigrants were unable to stay in the US.
