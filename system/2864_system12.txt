New Delhi, Jun 25 (PTI) Undue sympathy towards convicts by awarding inadequate jail term "undermines public confidence in efficacy of law", the Delhi High Court has said while upholding a 10-year term awarded by a trial court to a man for raping and trying to kill his ex-employers daughter-in-law. 
Dismissing the 45-year-old mans plea for reduction of his punishment, Justice S P Garg said that awarding inadequate sentences is a "serious threat" society which it would not be able to endure.
