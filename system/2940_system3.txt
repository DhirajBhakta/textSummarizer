Weve learned that when the decision feels really hard it doesnt necessarily mean its the right one, but it means were taking the right kind of risk.There was so much lost sleep in the early days and it took a toll on our healthI think the ability to make things is super important. 
It also took us a while to get comfortable with making big changes to the product.
