Gossipmongers had a field day last week when reports of Farhan Akhtar and Aditya Roy Kapoor having a nasty spat over the latter's closeness with Shraddha Kapoor started doing the rounds. 
Now, Farhan posted a photo with Aditya on Twitter, quashing all reports of a fight. 
"And that, as they say, is that.. 
RIP rumours. 
#lastnight #chilltimes," he captioned the picture.And that, as they say, is that.. 
RIP rumours. 
Both went blue in the face denying that they were ever in a relationship, but to no avail.
