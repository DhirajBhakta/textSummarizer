FIFA is set to shift India's Under-17 World Cup matches from Mumbai to the national capital Delhi as the apex soccer body has taken the host governments request "very seriously". 
The All India Football Federation (AIFF) initially wanted Mumbai to host India's home matches but later asked FIFA to shift them to Delhi due to pressure from the sports ministry as it felt it was appropriate that the capital hosts the home teams games.
