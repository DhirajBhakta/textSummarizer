Washington, Jan 10 (PTI) The human appendix, which is thought to be of little use to the body, may actually serve as a reservoir for beneficial gut bacteria, a new study has found. 
Although it is widely viewed as a vestigial organ with little known function, the new study suggests that the appendix may serve an important purpose. 
Several other mammal species also have an appendix and studying how it evolved and functions in these species may shed light on this mysterious organ in humans. 
This suggests that the appendix likely serves an adaptive purpose. 
This finding suggests that the appendix may play an important role as a secondary immune organ.
