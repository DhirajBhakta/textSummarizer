In a sudden move, the Ministry of Home Affairs has awarded the 'Z' category security cover to Amar Singh. 
The decision is an interesting one by the NDA government, which, since coming to power, has downgraded the Rajya Sabha MP's cover several times before completely withdrawing it in June this year. 
Under the 'Z' category cover, which is the country's second-highest security categorisation, Singh will be guarded by 24 commandos of the central armed police, with protection also being extended to his home and office. 
The security cover, interestingly, is at the same level that Singh enjoyed under UPA II. 
The ministry's order did not mention a reason for granting the security cover, which, importantly, will only be available to Singh in Uttar Pradesh and not the rest of India.
