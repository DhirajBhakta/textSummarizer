New Delhi, May 17 (PTI) Air travellers have voiced concerns over what they call lopsided measures in the no-fly list for unruly passengers and demanded airlines should also be held equally accountable for misbehaviour of their crew. 
The Ministry of Civil Aviation earlier this month released draft rules on a "national no-fly list" for unruly passengers for all domestic carriers. 
It proposes a flying-ban for a minimum period of three months and a maximum duration which can extend indefinitely. 
The draft was released on May 5 and comments have been invited until June 4. 
The proposed no-fly list will compile data on disruptive passengers from all airlines. 
In case an airline imposes a fly-ban on a passenger, other airlines can independently decide whether to allow him or her. 
The first level of misdemeanor, which includes verbal harassment or physical gesture, carries a flying ban of three months. 
The second level comprises physically abusive behaviour and will carry a ban of six months.
