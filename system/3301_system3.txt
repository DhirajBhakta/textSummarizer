The Ministry of Civil Aviation earlier this month released draft rules on a "national no-fly list" for unruly passengers for all domestic carriers. 
The official said the governments intention is to have a balance, but added that those who gave feedback felt the draft rules were "tilted towards airlines". 
The proposed no-fly list will compile data on disruptive passengers from all airlines. 
The government has recommended three levels of unruly behaviours- each entailing a corresponding duration for flying ban.
