The government said in the Supreme Court on Friday that the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has been asked to explore the option of putting jammers to prevent students from accessing online child pornography in school.The court was hearing a petition seeking a directive to the government to block all websites hosting pornographic content.Additional solicitor general Pinky Anand said that 3,522 sites were blocked in June, but ruled out installing jammers in school buses as part of steps to prevent youngsters from being abused sexually on the internet.?
It said the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) shares an Interpol list on online child sexual abuse material with the government, which then orders internet service providers to block these sites.
