A model from Nepal, Anjali Lama has crystal clear skin. 
Lama is a transgender; the first from the 'other' category to walk at the Lakme Fashion Week. 
"I have heard he says that he can change gay people to straight," says Lama, referring to Ramdev Baba. 
After Nepal Fashion Week (NFW) crushed her modelling dreams by rejecting her for three consecutive years, Lama came to Mumbai last year to give LFW a shot.
