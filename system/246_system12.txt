Lap 52/70 Hamilton has been told hes got five laps to get the job done on Raikkonen. 
Hamilton needs to get results soon or hell be given a team order he wont much enjoy:LAP 50:  "Lewis will let you go by if he can't get past Raikkonen."
He got the line taken away from, he sees me go past, and its like Ive got to fix this and thats it.
