The jailing of Jakartas Christian governor on blasphemy charges has sparked outrage from his supporters in Indonesia, rights organisations and the EU.On Tuesday, a court in the capital of the worlds largest Muslim-majority country found Basuki Tjahaja Purnama  better known by his nickname Ahok  guilty of blasphemy, sentencing him to two years in prison.The EU has consistently stated that laws that criminalise blasphemy when applied in a discriminatory manner can have a serious inhibiting effect on freedom of expression and on freedom of religion or belief, the EU delegation to Indonesia and Brunei Darussalam said in a statement posted on its website. 
Conducted by the musician Addie MS, the crowd sang the national anthem, Indonesia Raya, and Pancasila Garuda, a song about Indonesias founding principles of unity and diversity.When words fail, music speaks #paduansuarabalaikota #ahok #saveahok #peace #nkrihargamati #garudapancasila pic.twitter.com/CdY64EGiDNOthers registered their opposition to the verdict and sentencing by tweeting under the hashtag #RIPHukumIndonesia, which means rest in peace Indonesian law.The Ahok case has been watched closely as a marker of the commitment to religious tolerance and pluralism in Indonesia, where religious hardliners have been playing an increasingly prominent role in politics.In an unusual move, the panel of five judges on Tuesday dismissed the prosecutors recommendations to drop the initial blasphemy charges due to insufficient evidence. 
But the judges  citing among others the expert opinion of an Islamic vigilante group leader  said they found the minority governor convincingly guilty of blasphemy, incarcerating him for two years. 
Ahok for months faced the wrath of hardline Islamists after he cited a Quranic verse on the campaign trail last September. 
The verse, he said, had been manipulated by some religious leaders to justify the claim the Muslims should not vote for non-Muslim leaders.Uproar over an edited version of the speech that went viral spilled into a series of angry mass rallies spearheaded by Islamists since late last year, and has catalysed the deepening of religious and ethnic divides in the capital.Some observers argue that religious hardliners may have swayed the Indonesian judiciary.International human rights organisations including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch said the verdict would tarnish Indonesias reputation for religious tolerance and pluralism, and urged the country to repeal its unjust blasphemy law.
