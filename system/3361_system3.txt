New Delhi, May 12 (PTI) In a big jolt to controversial AAP leader Somnath Bharti who is facing a domestic violence case, the police today told the Delhi High Court that a medical report has opined that the scars on his wifes body were "due to dog bites and burn injuries". 
The investigators also alleged before Justice I S Mehta that Bharti, former Law Minister, used to harass and beat his wife Lipika Mitra, who has sought cancellation of his bail in a domestic violence case lodged by her. 
The police, which has filed its affidavit following the courts direction, also submitted in the court orally that an "AIIMS medical board has opined that the scars on the womans body were due to dog bites and burn injuries". 
The investigators had on April 5 last year filed the charge sheet in the case, mentioning that the woman had made an allegation that Bharti had endangered the life of an unborn child which she was carrying by unleashing his dog on her. 
Lipika had moved the high court challenging the bail order, saying it was almost like a verdict and the trial court had relied on the case diary which allegedly should not have been done at that stage.
