It was only last year that Tusshar Kapoor became a single parent through surrogacy. 
The 40-year-old actor welcomed his bundle of joy, Laksshya and since then he has been busy being a hands-on daddy. 
And the actor is extremely happy for filmmaker Karan Johar who has joined the bandwagon of Bollywood's single parents. 
Being a single parent teaches you time management and in a matter of minutes, you become so selfless because your energies are suddenly not for you, they're for your child.
