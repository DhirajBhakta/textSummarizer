It is a known fact that Madhuri Dixit was dating Sanjay Dutt back in the early 90s. 
But as soon as Dutt was arrested in 1993 Bombay blasts, Madhuri started to maintain her distance, and as they say, rest is history. 
However, in an interview to Mid-Day, Madhuri rubbished the rumours and said, "For where I am today, this [the topic of Dutt] has become redundant. 
There were reports that Karisma Tanna was supposed to essay the role of Madhuri in the biopic. 
Ranbir Kapoor has stepped into the shoes of Sanjay Dutt for the biopic.
