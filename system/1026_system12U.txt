New Delhi, Aug 2 (PTI) Mobile industry body Indian Cellular Association (ICA) today criticised the business climate in India saying cumbersome processes have emerged out of distrust between tax officials and customs authorities. 
He said that IGCR (Import of goods at concessional rate of duty for manufacture of excisable goods) processes are very cumbersome in the country. 
Industry players raised concerns over huge capital getting blocked in bank guarantees given as assurance to customs that the items imported by them on concessional duty rates will not be retailed in the market and will be used solely for making mobile phones.
