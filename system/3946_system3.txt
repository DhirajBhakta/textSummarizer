Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Tejaswi Yadav today launched a scathing attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi urging him to speak the truth on the occasion of Ram Navami. 
Respected PM, at least on the auspicious occasion of Ram Navami today, please speak the truth on when implementation will start on your poll promise of providing jobs to 2 crore youths every year" Tejaswi asked.Tejashwi's remark came in response to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's tweet greeting people on Ram Navami. 
In fact last month, when Bihar celebrated its foundation day on March 22, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had greeted the people of the state. 
However, Lalu Prasad's minister son had criticised the PM describing PM tweet as "hollow greeting".Tejaswi, then had slammed PM Modi maintaining that Bihar which gave BJP 31 MPs in Lok Sabha polls in 2014, the long pending demand of the state of being granted a special status is still not been met despite the Modi government completing three years in power.
