https://t.co/hP6aiYeZadThis is not the first time that Tejaswi has directed his jibe at PM Modi. 
In fact last month, when Bihar celebrated its foundation day on March 22, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had greeted the people of the state. 
However, Lalu Prasad's minister son had criticised the PM describing PM tweet as "hollow greeting".Tejaswi, then had slammed PM Modi maintaining that Bihar which gave BJP 31 MPs in Lok Sabha polls in 2014, the long pending demand of the state of being granted a special status is still not been met despite the Modi government completing three years in power.
