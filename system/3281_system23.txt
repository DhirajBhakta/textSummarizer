The search and rescue operation launched after an old bridge collapsed in South Goa on Thursday evening has been affected by the presence of crocodiles in the river. 
Bodies of two people have been recovered so far and several are still missing as divers are finding it difficult to go deep into the Sanvordem river due to fear of crocodiles in the water. 
Search operations resumed today morning to locate missing people who fell into the river after the dilapidated Portuguese-era bridge across the river Sanvordem collapsed.
