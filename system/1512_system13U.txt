Shortly after reports said Congress veteran ND Tiwari has joined the BJP, the party clarified only his son Rohit Shekhar has joined. 
Sources in the BJP said Shekhar has joined the party ahead of the Uttarakhand Assembly election, while Tiwari has only extended his support to the party.Earlier today, Tiwari went to BJP president Amit Shah's residence in New Delhi along with his son Rohit and wife Ujjwala, dealing a major blow to a party he served for over five decades ahead of the February 15 election.Tiwari, 91, was Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister for three terms and was the third Chief Minister of Uttarakhand from 2002 to 2007.
