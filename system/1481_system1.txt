Jaipur, Jan 20 (PTI) Actor Rishi Kapoor has revealed he was not ready to do a scene in his father Raj Kapoors "Shree 420" and it was a chocolate bribe by Nargis Dutt that convinced him to do it. 
During a session at the ongoing Jaipur Literature Festival (JLF), the 64-year-old actor, who has recently released his autobiography "Khullam Khula", said he was two when he accepted his first bribe. 
"I had to give a shot and it was raining that day. 
It was Nargis who came up with the idea to offer me chocolate to get the shot done. 
In that sense, I started taking bribes when I was two-year-old," Rishi said.
