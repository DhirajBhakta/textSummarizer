						From getting into the skin of the character to getting the body language right, the Jagga Jasoos star had to put in a lot of hard work to get every aspect of Dutt correct.Getting the look right is very superficial, it is easy as you have help from make-up and computer graphics. 
To show Sanjay Dutt as a human being, as a biopic only works when you show the human side of a person, and not the glories but the downfall as well (was not easy).Though Ranbir seems to have got the look right, he is extremely nervous about the film.I dont know if I have nailed it or not (referring to the film).
