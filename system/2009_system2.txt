The euphoria over rise in world tiger population early this year may have been misplaced for India as the official data placed before Parliament shows that 98 tigers died in the country till November 16, 2016, a steep 25 per cent rise over last year when 78 deaths were reported.The figures collected by National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) also take the wind out of government efforts to encourage tiger foundations for sensitising the public and fighting poachers to save the big cats.
