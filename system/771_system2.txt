This amount was channelised via state-owned Agriculture Insurance Company (AIC) to private companies, it said in its latest report.The CAG report examined the crop insurance schemes -- NAIS, MNAIS and Weather Based Crop Insurance Scheme (WBCIS) implemented during 2011-12 through 2015-16. 
These schemes, however, now have been replaced with new Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojan (PMFBY) from 2016 kharif season.During 2011-16, AIC had released Rs 36,222.79 crore as premium subsidy to 10 private insurance companies without compliance with any of the guidelines..., the auditor said in the report placed before Parliament.It added that the AIC failed to exercise due diligence by verification of claims by private insurance companies before releasing the funds to them. 
There was no proper grievance redressal system and monitoring mechanism for speedy settlement of farmers complaints at the central or state government level, it added.
