The case triggered a storm of protest in Portugal, where one female lawmaker described the ruling as Taliban jurisprudence.The France-based European court of human rights sided with Morais, saying Portuguese judges were guilty of prejudices and had violated the right to respect for private and family life. 
It ordered Portugal to pay Morais 3,250 ($3,790) in damages and 2,460 for costs and expenses.The Portuguese courts decision ignored the physical and psychological importance of sexuality for womens self-fulfillment and other dimensions of womens sexuality, the European court said.The [Lisbon court] decision had moreover been based on the general assumption that sexuality was not as important for a 50-year-old woman and mother of two children as for someone of a younger age.
