A day after the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) polls threw up a hung verdict, Shiv Sena's tally of corporators rose to 87 today with three party rebels who won as Independent nominees returning to its fold. 
WORKING ON NUMBERS FOR MAYORAL ELECTIONWith the fractured verdict restricting their options, Sena and BJP are trying hard to enlist support of as many corporators as possible to stack up numbers ahead of the Mayoral election scheduled next month. 
According to sources in the Sena, Thackeray will hold a meeting of all senior party leaders and newly-elected corporators at the Shiv Sena Bhavan to decide on the future course of action.
