Hearing a petition filed by a Yerwada jail inmate about the inhuman condition there, a division bench of Justice R M Savant and Justice Sadhna Jadhav of Bombay High Court today said, "After the death of Manjula Shetye, the issue of security of inmates has become important and it needs to be looked into." 
The 41-year-old petitioner Balu alias Shivaji Tukaram Choudhary was arrested by police in 2014 for the murder of a gangster Parshuram. 
Since then, Balu has been in Yerwada Central Jail and has been complaining about the inhuman condition there.
