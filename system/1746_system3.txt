A 105-year-old man has made history by cycling more than 14 miles round a track in an hour.Robert Marchand set the first hour record in the over-100s category in 2012, then beat it himself two years later at the age of 102, when he covered more than 16 miles. 
While his distance in Wednesdays ride was not as great as those two, the new over-105s category had been specially created for him to reflect the magnitude of his feat.Cheered by hundreds of fans, the Frenchman completed 92 laps round the velodrome at Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines, near Paris.I did not see the sign warning me I had 10 minutes left, said Marchand. 
Marchands fans chanted Robert, Robert as he neared the end of the ride and gave him a standing ovation at its conclusion, before he was mobbed by TV crews.He could have been faster but he made a big mistake. 
He was 68 when he began a series of cycling feats.While Marchand is not making plans for the future, his coach, Gerard Mistler, said he would not be surprised to see him continue cycling.
