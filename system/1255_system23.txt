Babies with this condition are perpetually jaundiced as their liver does not produce an enzyme that is necessary to break down bilirubin, a yellowish bi-product of bodys natural processes, to an excretable form.The light emitted during phototherapy helps the bilirubin to break down to the excretable form and does the work of the enzyme. 
However, as the child grows and the skin becomes thicker, they need to stay under the blue light for longer periods, said Dr Sibbal.The normal bilirubin count is 1; Khalids count was 30 when he underwent a liver transplant at Indraprastha Apollo hospital to reverse the condition.
