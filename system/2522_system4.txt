Prison officials said though there is a post of an executioner in the prison manual ever since its construction in the mid 1950s, jail records do not show any name who has worked as one. 
Over the past years, the jail has received letters from the public offering to be executioners. 
We received 2-3 letters from citizens offering their services to kill convicts on the death row. 
said an official.According to jail rules, any person who is mentally sound is eligible to be an executor. ?
Gupta said another reason why the jail did not have a hangman was because the man would have no job. 
If there were a salaried man, he would be getting paid for no work.?
