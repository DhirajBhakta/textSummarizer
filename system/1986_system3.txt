Finance Minister Arun Jaitley today said that no questions will be asked if any amount of old currency is deposited in one go, but repeated deposits may invite questions from concerned authorities. 
Talking to reporters in New Delhi , the Finance Minister also slammed the Opposition for accusing the Modi government of going ahead with the huge decision of taking out Rs 500, 1000 notes from circulation without any proper planning. 
Even today, RBI has more than adequate cash to last not just till December 30 but even beyond it," Jaitley told reporters.
