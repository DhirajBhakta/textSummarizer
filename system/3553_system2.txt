Delhi Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) chief and MP Manoj Tiwari today had breakfast with slum dwellers of Samaypur Badli. 
Accompanied with Leader of Opposition Vijendra Gupta, he visited the slum and had his morning meal at a resident's house."
Breakfast is just a gesture, I am making notes about the problems of the area. 
The slums are deprived of water, sewage and toilets. 
On Arvind Kejriwal's repudiating stance on MCD election result, Tiwari added,"What work is he talking about... 
Work is here where I am standing (in the slums)... 
Work cannot be done from air conditioned rooms."
He also requested the Delhi Chief Minister to join him in making slums a better place to live.
