Bollywood actor Amitabh Bachchan has at least one Vodafone connection and it's giving him (some) trouble. 
Interestingly, Reliance Jio was (also) quick to rise to the occasion, responding to big B's tweet saying it "would be happy to deliver a Jio SIM to him and activate it instantly through their Aadhaar based eKYC home delivery process." 
In fact, if you observe carefully, you'd notice it was among the first few handles to respond to Bachchan's tweet.
