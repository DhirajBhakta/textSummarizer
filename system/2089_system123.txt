Now, the corporation proposes to pay them a regular salary, even if they dont catch any monkey. 
Thats the last thing we can do to attract monkey catchers, said a senior SDMC official. 
For the past three years, the corporation has written letters to the state governments asking for help in procuring services of monkey catchers. 
We wrote to different states corporations such as Haryana, UP, HP and Andhra Pradesh for providing monkey catchers but failed to get any reply, said RBS Tyagi, director veterinary department, SDMC.According to him, there are multiple reasons responsible for existing shortage of workforce.The monkeys are protected under the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972.
