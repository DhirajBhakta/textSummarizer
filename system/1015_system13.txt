The committee is an umbrella body of several organisations which are demanding creation of a Gorkhaland state, to be carved out of the hills and parts of Jalpaiguri, Alipurduar and Cooch Behar districts in north Bengal.An indefinite shutdown of the hills entered the 34th day on Tuesday with no signs of an early settlement to the issue.The state government led by chief minister Mamata Banerjee has ruled out bifurcation of the state and has blamed outside forces, including militant groups of the northeast and Maoist rebels from Nepal, of backing the Gorkhaland movement.Yogesh Goley, a senior member of the Gorkha Janmukti Yuva Morcha, said Tamang was killed around 10.30 pm.
