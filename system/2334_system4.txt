Half of that amount is to be forcibly eradicated, and the other half removed through crop substitution agreements with coca farmers.The substitution program is part of a peace deal with Farc rebels, who renounced drug trafficking as part of their demobilization deal. 
s 53 years as an armed insurgency, it financed its fight through the drug trade.Former combatants have committed to work with the government to convince farmers to replace coca crops with another way to make a living.?
said Rodrigo Pardo, who heads the government agency in charge of implementing the peace agreement.But the deal on crop substitution with the Farc, announced before the final peace deal was finalized last year, also provided a perverse incentive for farmers to grow coca, knowing they would later be awarded subsidies.
