The Indian Army, after consultations with the Defence Ministry, is considering cutting down the numbers of its sahayaks or 'buddies' by 25 percent. 
The move would come in the wake of the controversy over the tasks Indian Army sahayaks perform for officers and junior commissioned officers.Under the army's 'buddy's system, sahayak jawans are attached to officers and junior commissioned officers. 
The civilian substitutes will be employed for officers in static formations such as the Army Headquarters or units in the Delhi area and not operational locations like battalions, brigades and division and corps headquarters. 
The Indian Navy and the Indian Air Force do not have such a system in place.The age-old system recently came into the spotlight after a few jawans posted grievance-filled videos on social media.
