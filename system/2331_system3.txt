Turkish authorities have sacked nearly 7,400 civil servants for alleged links to terror groups on the eve of the countrys first anniversary of last years failed coup attempt.Thousands are expected to turn out for national unity marches in Istanbul and Ankara over the weekend, and President Recep Tayyip Erdoan will unveil the Martyrs Memorial on an iconic Istanbul bridge to remember those who died opposing the coup.It has been exactly one year since Turkeys darkest and longest night was transformed into a bright day, since an enemy occupation turned into the peoples legend, Prime Minister Binali Yldrm said on Saturday in a special parliamentary session attended by Erdogan.Turkish soldiers attempted to overthrow Erdoans government using tanks, warplanes and helicopters on 15 July 2016. 
The coup plotters declared their seizure of power on the state broadcaster, bombed the countrys parliament and other key locations, and raided a resort on the Aegean where Erdoan had been holidaying. 
Your country is grateful to you, Yldrm said.In the aftermath of the coup attempt, Turkey declared a state of emergency that has been in place for a year, which has allowed the government to rule by decrees and dismiss tens of thousands of people. 
More than 50,000 people have also been arrested for alleged links to US-based cleric Fethullah G?len, who is blamed for orchestrating the failed coup, and operating other terror groups. 
The government calls the crackdown necessary to purge state institutions of those linked to G?len, but critics say the dismissals are arbitrary and paths to recourse severely curtailed.15 July has been declared a national holiday.Public transport in Istanbul and Ankara is free over the weekend, and bus destination signs were displaying messages of congratulations.As on the night of the coup attempt, mosques across Turkey will simultaneously recite a verse, usually read before Friday prayers, to alert and invite Muslims to the streets.
