These urban villages are located adjacent to upscale residential sectors but are yet to have basic civic amenities such as drainage, sewage network and roads, among others.We are working on preparing a robust municipal policy to ensure the development of civic facilities in villages on a par with urban areas. 
For example, choking of drains in villages on Thursday and subsequent waterlogging after Thursdays downpour was a result of lack of municipal services in villages, officials said.Migrant workers and daily wagers cannot afford to live in sectors because of high rental costs.
