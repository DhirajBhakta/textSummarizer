There is only a 5% chance that the Earth will avoid warming by at least 2C come the end of the century, according to new research that paints a sobering picture of the international effort to stem dangerous climate change.Global trends in the economy, emissions and population growth make it extremely unlikely that the planet will remain below the 2C threshold set out in the Paris climate agreement in 2015, the study states. 
MIT research has shown that emissions cuts in the Paris agreement would stave off around 1C of temperature increase by 2100  findings misrepresented by Trump when he announced the US departure from the pact.Sterman said the US must dramatically speed the deployment of renewable energy and especially energy efficiency.
