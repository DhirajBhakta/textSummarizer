The Indian women's cricket team is the toast of the nation having defeated favourites Australia in the Women's World Cup semi-final. 
India's top-scorer of the 2011 World Cup final Gautam Gambhir, currently working as an ESPNcricinfo analyst, reckons if the Mithali Raj-led team can go on to win the big final come Sunday, the victory will be even bigger than the glory men's team achieved at the Wankhede Stadium in 2011."
But the women won the semi-final against Australia in difficult conditions. 
They are one step away from the World Cup and if they can win this, it will be bigger than the 2011 World Cup win," he told India Today.Gambhir was equally effusive in praise of the women who made the difference in the semi-final Harmanpreet Kaur."
