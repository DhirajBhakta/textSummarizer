He was removed from the BCCI by the Supreme Court in January for failing to convince Board members to implement the Lodha Reforms.Since then, the SC-appointed Committee of Administrators (CoA) has spent an unsuccessful six months failing to make any headway in the matter.Recently, former India captain Sourav Ganguly, while accepting birthday wish from Thakur, urged him to make a comeback into cricket administration.It was kind of Sourav to have said something like that.
