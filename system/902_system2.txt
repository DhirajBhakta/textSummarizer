This compensation, however, will be for those survivors, who have been meted with the most horrific acts of violence, including gang-rape, leading to physical and mental disability. 
The scheme offered assistance of up to Rs3 lakh. 
In cases where women face gang-rape or permanent physical or mental disability through violent actions, such survivors need the maximum amount of help for rehabilitation. 
But there may also be other cases where rape is attempted on the pretext of marriage or the crime doesnt lead to permanent physical trauma or disfigurement. 
Considering this, we have categorised compensation for different cases, said Vinita Singhal, principal secretary, women and child development department.In the most cruel crime, where the survivor faces permanent disability, financial assistance will be Rs10 lakh.
