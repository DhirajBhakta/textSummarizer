Did Mugaruza and Williams just chose to carry their own gear then, or have they stopped offering that to the women I think its a good tradition, theyre in the final so should get all the special treatment going (in fact Im disappointed there arent rose bearers casting petals in front of the players for them to walk on).I have no idea, David, but its a good question.
