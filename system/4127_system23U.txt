Agitating doctors in Maharashtra have been asked to resume work by 8 pm today or risk losing six months' worth of salary, state minister for medical education Girish Mahajan said today. 
The protest was sparked by an incident last week when the relatives of a deceased patient beat up a resident doctor at Mumbai's Sion Hospital.Addressing the issue behind the agitation, Mahajan said, "The government will provide 500 guards too civic-run hospitals within five days, 600 guards within 20 days and 1,100 guards within a month."
