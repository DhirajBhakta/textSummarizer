In a statement (see earlier) the recently elected French leader said he sent the British people Frances compassion and sorrow and pledged to continue working with Britain to fight terrorism.Frances prime minister, ?douard Philippe, condemned what he called the most cowardly terrorism that had specifically and clearly targeted young people going to a concert. 
The European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, has given this statement:It was with great sadness and profound shock that I learnt of the brutal attack that struck Manchester.It breaks my heart to think that, once again, terrorism has sought to instil fear where there should be joy, to sow division where young people and families should be coming together in celebration.I would like to convey my deepest sympathies to Prime Minister May and to the British people.Today we mourn with you. 
For others the terror was all too immediately apparent.The lights had just come on and Ariana Grande had left the stage after concluding an elaborate three-hour, four-part entertainment extravaganza with an encore performance of her latest single, Dangerous Woman.At 10.30pm following a sold-out show in the 21,000-capacity Manchester Arena, thousands of fans began to gather up their belongings and filter slowly out of four exits.Then the bang.For the first milliseconds, minds did not immediately connect the sound with an explosion or a bomb.It sounded like a big balloon popping, but it was kind of muffled, like it wasnt in the stadium itself, said a young Mancunian fan, identified as Sammy, in a video he recorded of his experience and posted on Periscope.There were a few screams, then there was silence.
