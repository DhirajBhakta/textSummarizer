In the face of this abominable crime, I would like to express to the citizens of Manchester and the British people, my sadness, the French people?
It was with great sadness and profound shock that I learnt of the brutal attack that struck Manchester.It breaks my heart to think that, once again, terrorism has sought to instil fear where there should be joy, to sow division where young people and families should be coming together in celebration.I would like to convey my deepest sympathies to Prime Minister May and to the British people.Today we mourn with you. 
I will be heading over to Greater Manchester police force headquarters after this press call to take part in the Cobra meeting alongside the police constable.
