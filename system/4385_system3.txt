Alleging that Modi did not only make promises to Ganga, but even struck deals with her, Gandhi said, "Modi told Maa Ganga that first make him the Prime Minister and then he will carry out the cleaning work." 
Bharti, who heads the Modi governments ambitious Namami Gange programme as Union Minister for Water Resources, said phase I of the Clean Ganga Mission, launched in July 2016, was intended to be complete by October next year.
