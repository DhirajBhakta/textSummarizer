And it was while the Singer matches were on that Waugh and Warne were approached.One unsubstantiated story has it that a man approached Warne, told him he was a great cricketer, gave him $5,000 (Rs 2.12 lakh) to spend at the gambling tables and later returned to genially ferret information. 
It was then that Warne and Waugh admitted taking money from the bookmaker for giving out apparently routine information.Upon hearing these indiscretions, Graham Hablish, then ACB chief executive, and Alan Crompton, then ACB chairman, met the players in a hotel room near Sydney airport - the team was on its way to the Caribbean - imposed the fines of $10,000 and $8000 and promptly let the matter rest.
