My sweetie pie  A post shared by Soni Razdan (@sonirazdan) on May 21, 2017 at 11:54pm PDTSo which film did she like Alia best in Soni says, I enjoyed most of her films be it Highway (2014), 2 States (2014) or Udta Punjab (2016). 
But if you ask me to choose the ones I loved, I would say she impressed me with her performances in Udta Punjab, Highway and Dear Zindagi (2016).
