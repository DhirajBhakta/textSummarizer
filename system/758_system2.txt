 From next week onwards, the North Delhi Municipal Corporation will start  replacing 1.15 lakh conventional streetlights with light emitting diode (LED). 
North civic body commissioner, Praveen Gupta said, The task for changing streetlights with LEDs was taken up by the south Corporation last year and we have learnt a lot from their experience. 
We have decided to do the work in two phases to avoid mess and assigned the task to the companies who have attained expertise in this field, he said.
