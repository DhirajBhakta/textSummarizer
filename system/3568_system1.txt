They were last seen in the 2012 film Ek Tha Tiger and now the makers are back with its sequel. 
And their on-screen reunion has got almost everybody talking. 
Katrina, who has worked with Salman in a handful of films, is glad to work with Salman again. 
During her session at Mind Rocks Guwahati 2017, the 33-year-old actor said that Tiger Zinda Hai is a very special film for her. 
"It's a really special set to be on because firstly, Salman is there. 
Salman and I acted together in Ek Tha Tiger, which is honestly one of my favourite films," she said at Mind Rocks Guwahati 2017.
