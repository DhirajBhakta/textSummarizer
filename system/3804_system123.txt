Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday launched BHIM-Aadhar pay app, that will allow people to make payments without using a smartphone. 
Instead, the app will enable payments through the fingerprint scanner, by authenticating the biometric details of a user with Aadhaar database. 
To enable the transactions through BHIM-Aadhar, merchants will have to purchase fingerprint scanners.With the implementation of the new system, all you will need is your fingerprint to make a payment.
