The High Court pulled up the top official of Maxx Mobilink Pvt Ltd after taking note of the plea of former captain that its orders have been defied by the firm. 
The court was hearing a petition filed by Dhoni seeking initiation of contempt proceedings against the companys CMD Ajjay Agarwal for defying its November 17, 2014 direction asking Maxx Mobilink to "refrain from selling any products" which uses the name of the cricketer in commercials. 
The court had also passed a similar order on April 21 last year asking Agarwal to inform about the steps taken to comply with the 2014 direction asking the firm to refrain from selling any product, claiming to be endorsed by Dhoni. 
The recent direction came after Dhonis counsel Suchinto Chatterji alleged that the firm has not yet complied with its previous directions. 
Earlier, the court had asked Maxx to give details of the steps taken by it to remove Dhonis name and photograph from its social media sites including its website and Facebook.
