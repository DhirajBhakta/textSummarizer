By Harinder Mishra Jerusalem, Jun 27 (PTI)?"Wake up: the most important PM of the world is coming", is how Prime Minister Narendra Modis forthcoming visit to Israel, the first by an Indian premier, is described in an article in one of the leading Israeli business daily. 
Business daily The Marker in a feature story in its Hebrew edition discussing Indo-Israel ties says that Israelis had set up huge expectations from US President Donald Trumps visit to the Jewish state but "he didnt say much" while Modi, a leader of 1.25 billion people enjoying massive popularity and representing one of the fastest growing economies of the world deserves a lot of attention.
