I think India had a lot of opportunities to get him out in Pune. 
#AskMichael what advice you give to team india when they are using DRS system in test match where you have only 2 reviews for 80 overs#AskMichael Do you think India should open with Vijay and Pujara and send KL Rahul to bat at No. 3 with Kohli coming in at No. 3??
On Ajinkya Rahane: Clarke: I think Rahane is a wonderful player... think India will give him another opportunity. 
I think India will make a change in Bengaluru. 
Clarke: India need to combat the big four players in Bengaluru. 
If India can keep these four quiet in Bengaluru, they can win the Test match.? Michael Clarke: Positive for Australian cricket that they have won the first Test.
