The film which is about carefree love and no-strings-attached relationships speaks a lot about modern-day romance. 
But Ranveer, who says that he is traditional when it comes to matters of the heart, admits that once upon a time he was a carefree lover and did enter into many no-strings-attached relationships. 
I'd cut off any string that I'd see. 
But yeah, you change and evolve as a person. 
You crave something more substantial. 
Now I can't even think of such relationships. 
My biological clock is ticking. 
I want to become a family man. 
I love kids."
