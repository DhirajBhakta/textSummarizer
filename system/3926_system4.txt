Washington, Apr 3 (PTI) Tree trunks in upland forests actually emit methane rather than storing it, say scientists who claim to have found a new, previously unaccounted source of this powerful greenhouse gas. 
Researchers from University of Delaware (UD) in the US found that upland forest soils usually take up and store methane, but this effect can be counteracted by methane emissions from tree trunks. 
"What we have found in this study is that some coarse woody debris act kind of like the soil and consume methane while other pieces of coarse woody debris emit small amounts of methane, which is also what we saw with living tree trunks," said Daniel Warner of UD.
