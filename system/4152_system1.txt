The Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) polls are scheduled to take place on April 22, and the BJP, which has been ruling the MCD for over a decade, has planned an aggressive campaign to take on its rivals.Besides the Congress, the BJP will also face challenge from Arvind Kejriwal's the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) which is contesting the MCD polls for the first time. 
To project a fresh, corruption-free face ahead of the MCD polls, Manoj Tiwari recently announced that the party will not field a single sitting councillor or his/her relative for the upcoming election.The decision took senior BJP councillors in Delhi by surprise but was believed to have the approval of the party's highest leadership.
