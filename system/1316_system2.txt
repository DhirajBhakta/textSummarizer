Former Australian middle-order stalwart Michael Hussey has urged Steven Smith's men to not try and rile India captain Virat Kohli in the four-Test series which starts this month. 
(Watch what Kohli and Dhoni did to Chahal after his 6 for 25)Smith suggested in an interview in December that his team would want Kohli a little angry. 
However, Hussey, who has been involved in some fabled India-Australia battles, said firing Kohli up would be a wrong idea. 
But that backfired on the hosts as Kohli went on to slam his then Test best of 169 in the Boxing Day match.Kohli seems to enjoy these battles and not many teams around the world want to rub the run-machine the wrong way. 
Hussey reckons Australia would do well to keep mum against Kohli.
