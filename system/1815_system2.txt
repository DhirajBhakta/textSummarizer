From K J M Varma ? Beijing, Dec 30 (PTI) A 64-year-old woman in China is believed to have become the oldest mother in the country to give birth to a baby. 
"Were keeping a close eye on the mother because women of this age can encounter cardiac failure and uncontrollable bleeding during or after a C-section, which are very dangerous," Teng said. 
Although there is no official data, including who is the oldest, anecdotal evidence suggests most of the older women had another baby after they lost their first child.
