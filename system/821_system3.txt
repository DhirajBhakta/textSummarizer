Lipstick Under My BurkhaDirector: Alankrita SrivastavaCast: Ratna Pathak, Konkona Sen Sharma, Aahana Kumra, Plabita Borthakur, Sushant Singh, Vikrant MasseyRating: 3.5/5After a long and controversial battle with the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC), Alankrita Srivastava?
t.Lipstick Under My Burkha is a simple story about four women and their dreams - of financial independence, of becoming a singer, of moving to a big city and of simply, enjoying life. 
Alankrita chooses a subtle narrative style to tell us the stories of four different women who are fighting a male chauvinist society and mindset. 
It is laughable that the CBFC had problems with such a light film that merely talks about women nurturing their own desires that cross the boundaries of a male-dominated society.
