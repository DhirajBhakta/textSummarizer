New Delhi, May 23 (PTI) In a major relief to students who have just taken Class 12 examinations, the Delhi High Court today directed the CBSE to follow its moderation policy of giving grace marks to students for difficult questions. 
The court asked the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) to continue with the policy which was in place when the examination forms were submitted last year.
