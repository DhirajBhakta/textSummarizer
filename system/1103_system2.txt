But I am used to this type of sledging, having toured Australia with India A teams in the past," Iyer said.Iyer also said he was confident that one day he will definitely get to play for India."
Today, Iyer started in brilliant fashion by hitting Australia's leading off-spinner Nathan Lyon for a first-ball six over long on.Later Iyer often stepped out to Lyon and left-arm spinner Stephen O'Keefe to hit them for a total of five sixes over long-on in an impressive display of attacking batting and was the biggest contributor to India A's first innings score.Iyer said the lofted shots he played against Lyon and O'Keefe were not predetermined."
