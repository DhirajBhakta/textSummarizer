A day after Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad's "sanctity for Muslims" comment created a stir, AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi reacted saying it's a minister's duty to ensure justice and equality.
?"Is the minister (Ravishankar Prasad) trying to patronise or threaten us Yes we didn't vote for you and will continue to do so...but it's your constitutional duty to ensure justice and equality as you have taken oath of constitution," the Hyderabad MP said."
Have we victimised any Muslim gentleman working in the industry or service Have we dismissed them We don't get Muslim votes.
