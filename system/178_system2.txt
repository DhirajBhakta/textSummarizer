 The state government has planned to implement cycling tracks along the arterial roads in 10 leading cities of the state. 
The state public works department will test the project, dubbed streets with cycle tracks in Pune, Nagpur, Nashik, Amravati, Chandrapur, Kolhapur, Solapur, Latur, Aurangabad and Jalgaon, on roads under the departments jurisdiction. 
The committee will identify arterial roads where cycle tracks can be set up depending on the availability of space and the scope for cycling. 
It will not only reduce traffic, but will also considerably lessen environmental pollution.Some of the previous efforts at creating cycling tracks and promoting bicycles have failed miserably owing to lack of proper planning and maintenance. 
Most cycling tracks of the 123-km network in Pune that the civic body created under the erstwhile Congress-led governments Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission are in a bad shape.
