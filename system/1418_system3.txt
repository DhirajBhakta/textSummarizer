The cracks in Pulkit-Shweta marriage began to appear in a few months after their big fat Punjabi wedding. 
Within a year of tying the knot, Shweta and Pulkit had already begin living separately. 
Soon enough, the news spread like wildfire and made tabloid headlines. 
Shweta pointed fingers at Yami for creating a rift between Pulkit and her. 
She even went onto say that Yami had hots for Pulkit ever since she knew her. 
But in a recent interview to Spotboye, Shweta took a detour when asked about Yami. 
Shweta, who is all set to start her life afresh post the turmoil, doesn't wish to do anything with Yami anymore. 
When asked if she still maintains that Yami is a home-breaker, she said, "Who is this Yami? 
Main koi Yami ko nahin jaanti. 
I am going through a memory loss."
