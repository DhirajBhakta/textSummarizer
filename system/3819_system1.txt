From Lalit K Jha Charlottesville (US), Apr 13 (PTI) To transform Indias economy, there is a need to reduce "friction" in businesses and create an "environment" wherein the government has more trust in its entrepreneurs, Infosys founder N R Narayana Murthy has said. 
We need to create an environment where the government has more trust in its entrepreneurs than it is today," Murthy, 70, told students of the prestigious Darden School of Business at the University of Virginia here. 
He, however, refrained from elaborating what the Indian government needs to do to create the environment of trust in its entrepreneurs and said, "I will tell you why, as an Indian citizen, it may not be proper if I were to be critical about India when I am outside India".
