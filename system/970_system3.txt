Austen becomes the first female writer (following in the footsteps of William Shakespeare and Charles Dickens) to feature on a banknote.The note, launched by the Bank of England at Austen?
s resting place, Winchester Cathedral, includes an image of the writer and one of her most beloved characters, Elizabeth Bennet. 
It joins the Churchill ?5 in the first family of polymer UK banknotes; a ?20 note featuring JMW Turner will follow in 2020. 
The Bank hopes featuring Austen will help it counter accusations of sexism for not featuring more women on notes. 
Austen, who wrote keenly about money, might have been interested in research from Aviva claiming that the ?10 pound note has a relative purchasing power of only 13p compared with what it could buy in 1817.
