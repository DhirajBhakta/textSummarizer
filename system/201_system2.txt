His understanding of the subject is limited, Musk tweeted last week. 
The tweet came after Zuckerberg, during a Facebook livestream earlier this month, castigated Musk for arguing that care and regulation was needed to safeguard the future if AI becomes mainstream.I think people who are naysayers and try to drum up these doomsday scenarios -- I just, I dont understand it. 
Its really negative and in some ways I actually think it is pretty irresponsible, Zuckerberg said.Musk has been speaking frequently on AI and has called its progress the biggest risk we face as a civilisation.AI is a rare case where we need to be proactive in regulation instead of reactive because if were reactive in AI regulation its too late, he said.
