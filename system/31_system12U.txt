Ismail will be the new Kashmir division chief of LeT after Dujana was killed by the security forces on Tuesday after a seven-hour gunfight in south Kashmir's Pulwama district. 
Proactive operations have been launched, mainly in south Kashmir, to track down Ismail as investigations including communication intercepts have pointed out to his involvement in the attack on Amarnath pilgrims.Attack in Anantnag appears to be a reprisal for killing of several Lashkar militants including Bashir Lashkari in an encounter with security forces earlier this month.
