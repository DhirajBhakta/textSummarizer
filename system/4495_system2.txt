India coach Anil Kumble gave a measured response on Friday after his team's spectacular collapse against Australia in the opening Test, calling it just one bad day for his world No. 1 team.Replying to Australia's 260, India, unbeaten in their previous 19 Tests, lost their last seven wickets for 11 runs to be bundled out for 105 in their first innings.
