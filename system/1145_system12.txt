Chandigarh, Feb 15 (PTI) Reacting to the arrest of Nabha jailbreak mastermind from the alleged house of an AAP worker, Punjab Congress president Amarinder Singh today sought a probe into what he called Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwals "nexus" with militants and gangsters in the state. 
There is apparently a "strong nexus between AAP and the militants as well as dreaded gangsters, posing a major threat to Punjabs security and safety", alleged Amarinder, demanding an independent investigation, preferably by a central agency, into the partys "dangerous" links.
