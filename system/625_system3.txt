After India Today reported on June 14 that Chennai Police has decided to transfer the case of money laundering against the ex-commissioner of Indian Premier League (IPL) Lalit Modi to Mumbai Police, the latter has declined to probe the matter. 
?K Jayanth Murali, Additional Director General of Police, Crime Branch Criminal Investigation Department (CBCID), Chennai confirming it said, "It is true. 
WHY DID CHENNAI POLICE TRANSFER THE CASEIn early July 2017, A K Vishwanathan, Commissioner of Police, Chennai had opined the proposal for transferring Lalit Modi's case to Mumbai Police or to the CBI, considering the nature, gravity and inter/intra state ramification and the parallel investigation conducted by the ED. 
The Central Crime Branch (CCB), Chennai had also agreed to it.In a confidential letter, accessed by Indiatoday.in, the Chennai Police Commissioner opined that "Tamil Nadu (TN) Police have no territorial jurisdiction to investigate the case, therefore, the case is to be transferred from CCD department, Chennai to Mumbai Police, without any further delay".Surprisingly, the state government, after careful examination accepted the proposal and accordingly, directed the Director General of Police to transfer the case to Mumbai for further investigation. 
The Tamil Nadu (TN) Police was also directed to inform the status to ED, Ministry of Finance, Department of Revenue and Government of India.WHAT IS THE CASE In 2010, the Chennai Police registered an FIR against Lalit Modi and others, on complaint filed by former BCCI Chief N Srinivasan. 
The probe revealed that the alleged transaction by committing various irregularities by Lalit Modi and six others, betrayed the interest of BCCI.The internal investigation report tabled by Chennai Police before the state government said, "The accused committed the offences of criminal breach of trust, forgery, cheating, falsification of accounts and defrauded BCCI in several instances to the tune of Rs 425 crore, Rs 125 crore, Rs 200 crore and Rs 3.5 crore without the consent of the IPL governing council".
