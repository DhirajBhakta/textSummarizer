Third set: Federer 7-6, 7-6, 3-3 Berdych* (*denotes next server)Perhaps Federer cant get that missed break point out of his mind. 15-30 on his serve, and he looks annoyed. 
Federer balloons a return but hes still 5-2 ahead and he now has two points on his serve ... a gasp as Federer loses the point for 5-3 ... but a cheer and standing ovation as he brings up three set points at 6-3 ...
