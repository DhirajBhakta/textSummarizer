Travel by bus is all set to get cheaper as the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government in Delhi is offering discount of up to 75% in order to encourage more people use public transport and leave their personal vehicles at home. 
For the whole of January, there will be a flat fare of Rs 5 in non-AC DTC and cluster buses  and Rs 10 for air-conditioned buses.Right now, a ride in a non-AC bus can cost anywhere between Rs 5 and Rs 15. 
The AC buses charge fares between Rs 10 and Rs 25.The government has decided to give free travel passes to students (below the age of 21), widows and senior citizens.
