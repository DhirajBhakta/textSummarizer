Los Angeles, Jun 23 (PTI) Scientists have created a skin patch that can power a radio for two days using human sweat, and may eventually be used to charge mobile devices while people are out for a run. 
The bio fuel patch may also provide a way to monitor glucose levels in people with diabetes, without needles and blood samples, researchers said.
