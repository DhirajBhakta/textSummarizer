I said a couple of years ago it had to get really bad, when there?
When I go out there I am fully confident and ready to go ? 
The last 100m race I ran was a 9.95sec which shows I am going in the right direction. 
My coach gave me my space, he gave me my time to get over it. 
Listen to us, Usain, I know it is hard but you need to get back training because Germaine would have wanted it ? 
That really helped me get going again.
