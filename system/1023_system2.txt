Sources told PTI here that just before the deadline lapsed, China once again sought a three-month extension until November 2 on its technical hold on the proposal.A veto-wielding permanent member of the Security Council, Beijing has repeatedly blocked Indias move to put a ban on the Jaish-e-Mohammed leader under the Al Qaeda Sanctions Committee of the Council.Last year in March, China was the sole member in the 15- nation UN organ to put a hold on Indias application with all other 14 members of the Council supporting New Delhis bid to place Azhar on the 1267 sanctions list that would subject him to an assets freeze and travel ban.The six-month validity of that technical hold lapsed in September and Beijing then extended it by three more months.In December last year, after China blocked Indias proposal to list the JeM chief, Indian diplomatic sources here had said that the pursuit of terrorism was not a one-shot affair for India and that it will continue to pursue issues of terrorism through all available mechanisms.Sources had said that the block would not prevent India from pursuing at the world body issues of terrorism and sanctioning of leaders of terror outfits.
