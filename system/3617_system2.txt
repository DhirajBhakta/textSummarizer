India's criminalisation of homosexuality did not stop a Punjab police sub-inspector from marrying a woman and that too with full Punjabi style. 
Manjit Kaur, a sub-inspector in the Punjab Police, tied a knot with a woman and it wasn't a hush-hush affair. 
According to figures submitted by the government to the Supreme Court in 2012, there are 25 lakh gay people in India. 
Perhaps, it is time the Supreme Court goes ahead and takes a progressive step and decriminalises homosexuality.
