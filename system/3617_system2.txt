The bureau helps them find the right match, both within and outside the country. 
Samson started the arranged gay marriage service when he received numerous requests from gays regarding prospective life partners. 
Till 2013, he used to help gays with surrogacy. 
According to figures submitted by the government to the Supreme Court in 2012, there are 25 lakh gay people in India.
