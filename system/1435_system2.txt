Hyderabad, Jan 24 (PTI) The Survey of India would soon "re-measure" the height of Mount Everest to verify doubts expressed over it in some sections of the scientific community following the major earthquake in Nepal two years ago and to help scientific studies, Surveyor General of India Swarna Subba Rao said here. 
"We are sending an expedition to Mount Everest. 
Everest height was declared, if I remember correctly, in 1855. 
But height given by Survey of India, even today, is taken as the correct height. 
We are re-measuring it. 
After that, there is a doubt in the scientific community that it is shrinking. 
Second reason is, it helps in scientific studies, plate movements etc," he said.
