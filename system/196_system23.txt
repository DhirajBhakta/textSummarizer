Srikant Guptas wallet did not permit it, but the Chhattisgarh primary school teacher bit the bullet for his wife  stealing two designer sarees allegedly worth Rs 56,000 for her to flaunt in a community gala. 
She wore the sarees to the gala titled Sawan Sundari (Monsoon Beauty) last week, but police soon came looking for Gupta, who earns Rs 2,500 per month as a Shiksha Mitra (a system under which teachers are hired on contract). 
We got a video of the gala where the woman was wearing one of the stolen sarees, said Siddiqui.
