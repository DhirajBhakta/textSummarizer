Punjab director general of police (DGP) Suresh Arora said on Thursday that the police will increase presence on social media, which is widely used by radicals to spread anger by spreading misinformation. 
Police will set up own Facebook and other social media handles to nullify all such rumors. 
They are trying to vitiate the communal atmosphere of the state. 
However, people have suffered a decade of militancy, and are well aware. 
He said that most of the terror modules busted by the police are such wherein youth were motivated using their religion. 
Most of the arrested person have no criminal background; they were misled by social media.
