He hasnt made a particularly enjoyable film since 2010s The Extraordinary Adventures of Ad?le Blanc-Sec, a film towards which I am slightly biased because it had shades of the Adventures of Tintin, a series I am immensely fond of.He followed it up with a trio of movies that could only be described as Bessonian  the Aung San Suu Kyi biopic, The Lady; the Robert De Niro Mafia family comedy, The Family; and the sci-fi thriller, Lucy, his highest-grossing film yet.
