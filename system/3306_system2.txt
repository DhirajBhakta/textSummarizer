Sacked Delhi minister Kapil Mishra continued his tirade against Arvind Kejriwal saying the Delhi chief minister has been to his office just twice in the last year. 
Mishra in his Facebook post said Kejriwal has been ducking his questions on corruption in the AAP government but has all the time to watch Sarkar 3. 
"New corruption cases are coming to light everyday. 
Houses of relatives and friends are being raided but the CM seems to be unaffected by all this. 
The CM who is completely cut off from public life has time to watch (movie) Sarkar 3," Mishra said in his scathing post.Mishra, who was removed by Kejriwal from his cabinet after he levelled serious corruption charges on the CM, further said that the Delhi CM barely goes to office and works the least. 
"He is the only CM in the country who has no portfolio, takes maximum offs, works the least and soon he will the one with maximum number of corruption cases," the former Delhi water supply minister said.Mishra has claimed that he had seen Kejriwal accepting Rs 2 crore from minister Satyendra Jain. 
Mishra, who was suspended from AAP soon after he made the allegations had also approached the CBI with 'evidence' about Kejriwal's corrupt practices.WATCH: Kapil Mishra demands Kejriwal's resignation, faints during press conferenceALSO READ:Kapil Mishra to approach CBI today, says Arvind Kejriwal must prepare to go to Tihar now
