Ridhima Pandit, who shot to fame with the portrayal of a humanoid robot on TV show Bahu Hamari Rajni Kant, is sure that she will never do small roles in films. 
She says,?
s behen or anything like that. 
I want to do roles that are substantial enough to help the story move ahead. 
Also, my demand is more on television [shows]. 
If I can be the queen on TV, why should I go and become a princess in films??
She is currently seen in the comedy show The Drama Company,which stars comedians such as Krushna Abhishek, Sudesh Lahri, and Sanket Bhosale. 
The experience is totally different from daily soaps. 
There are no retakes, and the camera is rolling for at least an hour to shoot the whole gag. 
Everyone on the sets says that it was commendable of me to pick up live comedy so quickly. 
It reminded me of my theatre days.? 
Ridhima adds that she does not want to be a part of any saas-bahu shows. ?
The regressive content of these shows doesn?
t convince me, and if I myself am not convinced, I can?
t expect my viewers to accept it,?
