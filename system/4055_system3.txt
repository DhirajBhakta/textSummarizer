BT has been fined ?42m, the largest penalty imposed by regulator Ofcom, and will have to pay an estimated ?300m in compensation to rival telecoms companies over delays installing high-speed internet connections.Ofcom found that BT broke rules put in place to stop Openreach, its subsidiary that controls the UK broadband infrastructure network, abusing its significant market power by cutting compensation payments to rivals, blaming installation delays on factors beyond its control when this was not the case.BT said it expected to pay out ?300m in compensation to rivals including Sky, Vodafone and TalkTalk for the serious breach of Ofcoms rules.The size of our fine reflects how important these rules are to protect competition and, ultimately, consumers and businesses, said Gaucho Rasmussen, investigations director at Ofcom. 
We found BT broke our rules by failing to pay other telecoms companies proper compensation when these services were not provided on time.BT was also fined ?300,000 for failing to provide information to Ofcom.We apologise wholeheartedly for the mistakes Openreach made in the past when processing orders for a number of high-speed business connections, said Clive Selley, chief executive of Openreach. 
A spokesman for Vodafone said: We hope this ruling will encourage BT Openreach to finally drop the unacceptable practices it has used to avoid paying compensation for late delivery of fixed fibre lines, which have impacted businesses across the country as well as our own 4G roll-out.Less than half (48.8%) of high speed ethernet installations were completed within 30 days, according to Openreachs own statistics for the final quarter of last year.However, Openreach said that almost 87% of installations are completed by the original agreed date, and that the number of outstanding orders is at a 34-month low.Rivals have repeatedly called for Openreach, responsible for building and maintaining the tens of millions of copper and fibre lines that run from telephone exchanges to homes and businesses across the UK, to be split from BT.They argue that BT has dragged its heels in opening the network to their engineers, which has hampered their ability to offer homes superfast broadband access.This month BT finally agreed a halfway house deal to legally separate Openreach, after two years of wrangling with Ofcom, which wants to strengthen the independence of the broadband network operator to promote competition and boost superfast services.The ?42m penalty follows a bad week for BT after Ofcom fined subsidiary Plusnet ?880,000 for continuing to charge more than 1,000 customers more than ?500,000 after they had cancelled their accounts.The fine is the latest headache for Gavin Patterson, the chief executive of BT, who has endured a torrid year that included an accounting scandal at its Italian operation that wiped ?8bn off its shares.The investigation  revealed we fell short of the high standards we expect in serving our communications provider customers, Patterson said.
