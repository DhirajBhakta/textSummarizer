The cabinet cleared a decision to make drip irrigation mandatory for the water-guzzling sugarcane crop after 2019 and promote group farming by offering a subsidy to participating farmers. 
We will also help the companies set up food processing units, enable them to export the products and set up mechanism for effective marketing, said agriculture minister Pandurang Fundkar.The decision was taken in the backdrop of the decline in the land holding per household to 1.44 hectares in 2010-11 from 4.28 hectares in 1970-71.
