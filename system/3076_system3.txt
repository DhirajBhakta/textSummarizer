Kabir Khan's Tubelight has already grabbed eyeballs for the on-screen camaraderie between Salman Khan and Sohail Khan, who play brothers in the film too. 
However, it was Salman who was keen to get Sohail on board as he was convinced that their real-life bromance will translate effectively on screen. 
Kabir, who has worked with Sohail for the first time, is happy with the actor's hardwork in the film.
