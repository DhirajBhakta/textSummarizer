For me, a simplistic way of looking at life was that if my phone still rings and the other person says that I have a role for you in my film I am successful, he says.The actor, who has experimented with various genres and roles, does not believe in categorising his work.  
Anything that I find interesting, I become that person and then its done, says the actor, who currently stars in a web series.In his career spanning over 15 years, the actor, who made his debut with Company, never found it difficult to portray different roles.
