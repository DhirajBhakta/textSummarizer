New Delhi, Apr 29 (PTI) The local pilots body of Jet Airways has deferred its decision to not fly with foreign pilots from next month. 
The National Aviators Guild, representing local pilots of Jet Airways, had earlier this month issued a directive to its members not to fly with expatriate commanders from May 1 after one of the foreign pilots allegedly assaulted a trainer in Bengaluru.
