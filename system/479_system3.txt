But while the 30-year-olds decision to listen to medical advice means he will be absent from next months US Open, the world No4 vowed to return stronger than ever and expressed his happiness that Agassi will continue to coach him in 2018.I will take this time to heal and do all the different suggested methods of rehabilitation and healing processes so I can get back on the court as soon as possible, Djokovic said. 
I want to thank Andre for being with me this year and sharing his experience and wisdom and Im looking forward to getting back on the practice courts with him and having him in the box for any big tournaments.Djokovics announcement came exactly a year after Roger Federer cut short his 2016 season with a knee injury. 
But Im also very grateful that I kept my body very healthy throughout the years. 
Now I have time to perfect it and build the foundations for the next five years or more. 
I really want to play professional tennis for years to come.
