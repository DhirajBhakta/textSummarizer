Novak Djokovic will miss the rest of the tennis season with a persistent elbow injury and has announced that Andre Agassi has agreed to remain part of his team next year.After 12 months of upheaval on and off the court, speculation had mounted that Djokovic would take an extended break from tennis in order to recover from the right-elbow injury that forced him to retire during his Wimbledon quarter-final against Tomas Berdych. 
Written off at the time, Federer returned from six months out to win the Australian Open in January and Wimbledon earlier this month.Djokovic, who was speaking in Belgrade, hopes that a similar period of rest will allow him to rediscover his spark.
