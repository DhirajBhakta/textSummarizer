A Family Welfare Committee (FWC) in every district will scrutinise dowry harassment cases before local police can arrest the accused, the Supreme Court said on Thursday, laying down a set of guidelines to curb misuse of the law.Indian Penal Codes Section 498A has been criticised for giving disgruntled women a legal option to harass their husbands, and Thursdays orders take forward measures announced by the top court in 2014 when it prohibited automatic arrests.A bench of justices AK Goel and UU Lalit barred the police from making direct arrest and said the involvement of civil society was necessary to achieve the laudable object of punishing cruelty at the hands of husbands or his relatives against the wife.Quoting the National Crime Records Bureaus 2012 data, the bench said that a quarter of all arrests were those of women  mothers and sisters of husbands  and while chargesheets were filed at an exponentially high 93.6% of cases, only 14.4% ended in convictions. 
The report projected that out of the 3,72,706 cases pending trial in 2012, as many as 3,17,000 were projected to lead to acquittals.Curbing misuseForm 3-member committee in every district of para-legal volunteers, social workers, working officers wives or suitable citizensDecide bail applications on same day as far as possibleGrant exemption from personal appearance or allow it by videoconferencingDont make passport impounding or red corner notice routine for people residing out of IndiaThe court, however, put a rider to its restrictions, saying that they were not valid in offences involving tangible physical injury or death.It is a matter of serious concern that large number of cases continues to be filed under Section 498A alleging harassment of married women. 
To remedy the situation, we are of the view that involvement of civil society in the aid of administration of justice can be one of the steps, apart from the investigating officers and the concerned trial courts being sensitised, the bench said.The top court also ordered that trial courts must decide bail applications in such cases on the same day as far as possible. 
The committee must submit its report to the authority, which refers the complaint to it within a month.Till the report is received, no arrest should be effected, the court said. 
These officers must be trained, which the court held must be completed within four months.In further directions to lower courts, the SC said that accused should be exempted from appearing in person or be allowed to appear via video conferencing as far as that does not adversely affect the progress of the case.In cases where accused is residing out of India, impounding of passports or red corner notice should not be a routine, the court said.In cases where a settlement is reached, it will be open to a district and sessions judge or any other senior judicial officer nominated by him in the district to complete the proceedings including the closing of the criminal case if dispute primarily relates to matrimonial discord.
