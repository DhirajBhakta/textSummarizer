Five districts of UP, Agra, Pilibhit, Muzaffar Nagar, Ghaziabad and Noida are facing a serious drought that is showing no signs of lifting anytime soon.A senior administrative official told India Today that out of 72 districts in UP, 44 are yet to have decent rainfall in the monsoon season. 
The affected districts of western UP include Agra, Oraiyya, Badaun, Bulandshehar, Etawah, Firozabad, Ghaziabad, Noida, Jhansi, Hamirpur, Jalaun, Jyotiba Phule Nagar, Hathras, Mahoba, Mathura, Meerut, Muzaffarnagar, Rampur, Pilibhit, Saharanpur, and Etah.Agra's neighboring district Mainpuri has had 307.99 mm rains in July, Etah has had 274.3 mm, Firozabad has had 244.4 mm, while Mathura has had only 164.3 mm rainfall. 
The civic amenities in the city are prone to failure in the event of heavy rains due to the lack of drainage in most of the city, as was witnessed a couple of years earlier when heavy rainfall caused vast property damage in the city and the municipal authorities struggled for days to clear the water-logging in the low-lying areas.Sharma said that even this month, the rainfall that took place a couple of days back, claimed the roofs of several old houses in Motikatra, Nagla Joshiyan and other parts of the old city, injuring a number of people. 
However, even 40-50 mm rainfall in a day would be enough to cut off most of the densely populated outer areas from the rest of the city for several hours, if not days.Meanwhile, Agra District Magistrate Gaurav Dayal has instructed all Sub-Divisional Magistrates and Additional District Magistrates of Agra to prepare reports of the drought so that the compensation amounts could be decided for the farmers.ALSO READ:
