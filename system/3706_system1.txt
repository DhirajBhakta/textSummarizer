the AAP national convener told Hindustan Times in an interview on Thursday.The AAP is making its debut in Delhi civic elections, being billed as a barometer for the Kejriwal government?
-- they converted Delhi into a dumpyard; dengue and chikungunya; rampant corruption.When you remember two years of AAP in government, everybody names at least these: power rates halved, free water, potable water in taps in some areas, improved conditions in hospitals, medicines and tests in hospitals for free, mohalla clinics, revolutionary work in education, private schools not allowed to hike fees.Now, we need to come together and clean Delhi. 
The BJP got a resolution passed in the MCD house that we will not allow installation of streetlight on MCD roads if they are funded by the AAP government.
