Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia will inaugurate eight public libraries constructed under the Swaraj Fund in the Karawal Nagar assembly constituency in north east Delhi on Sunday. 
These libraries are unique in their own way as they have been put together from the citizen local area development fund, or Swaraj fund, and were taken up after people chose them as priority projects in mohalla sabhas conducted in various assembly constituencies last year.
