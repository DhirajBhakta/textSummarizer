A Norwegian anti-immigrant group has been roundly ridiculed after members apparently mistook a photograph of six empty bus seats posted on its Facebook page for a group of women wearing burqas.Tragic, terrifying and disgusting were among the comments posted by members of the closed Fedrelandet viktigst, or Fatherland first, group beneath the photograph, according to screenshots on the Norwegian news website Nettavisen.Other members of the 13,000-strong group, for people who love Norway and appreciate what our ancestors fought for, wondered whether the non-existent passengers might be carrying bombs or weapons beneath their clothes.
