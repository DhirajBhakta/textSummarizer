The court of appeal ruled that the four-finger design had no inherent distinctiveness.After deliberating for months, the three appeals judges delivered their judgment on Wednesday in a 16,000-word ruling that found the KitKat shape was not a badge of origin.We are concerned here with ... the three-dimensional shape of a chocolate product, that has no inherent distinctiveness, said Lord Justice Kitchin.The ruling marks the latest stage in a bitter-tasting battle between Nestl? and Mondelz, the US owner of Cadbury, that have been battling over the KitKat trademark for seven years.Nestles appeal followed a UK high court ruling in January last year that blocked the trademark attempt. 
The European court of justice had previously found that the four-fingered shape, breaking apart with a snap, was not distinctive enough to merit a trademark and that such a designation would not comply with European law.The ruling clears the way for competitors, including the major supermarkets as well as other confectioners, to produce their own copycat KitKats without fear of legal consequences.But a Nestl? spokesperson indicated the Swiss firm was not necessarily prepared to give up, saying it was considering its next move. 
Protected shape marks are not without precedent  Toblerone, which is owned by Mondelz, has successfully trademarked its zigzag prism shape.But the appeal judges found that while the four-finger shape might be very well known in association with KitKat, that does not necessarily mean that the public have come to perceive the shape as a badge of origin such that they would rely upon it alone to identify the product as coming from a particular source.They might simply regard the shape as a characteristic of products of that kind or they might find it brings to mind the product and brand name with which they have become familiar.These kinds of recognition and association do not amount to distinctiveness for trademark purposes.The judges also noted that the chocolate bars shape had not been central to its marketing in recent years: It has nothing, therefore, to do with the informed choices that consumers make between similar products.The judges heard that Nestl? had spent between ?3m and ?11m a year advertising and promoting KitKats between 1996 and 2007. 
They confer monopoly rights, so I can see entirely why Nestl? thought, our four-finger bar KitKat has been around for ages, lets register it, because we can stop anyone from producing a bar in four fingers, she said.It is typically brand owners in this space that will spend the money and push the boundaries, in trying to get as much protection as possible, because at the end of the day trademarks can potentially last forever, so it really is a signficant monopoly right.Asked if she could foresee a challenge in supreme court, Jackman said: Im not going to rule it out, because I think these are two brand owners who are prepared to push this as far as it can go.The four-fingered battle is not the only protracted legal disputes between the two confectioners.
