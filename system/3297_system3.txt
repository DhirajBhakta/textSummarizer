The European court of justice had previously found that the four-fingered shape, breaking apart with a snap, was not distinctive enough to merit a trademark and that such a designation would not comply with European law.The ruling clears the way for competitors, including the major supermarkets as well as other confectioners, to produce their own copycat KitKats without fear of legal consequences.But a Nestl? spokesperson indicated the Swiss firm was not necessarily prepared to give up, saying it was considering its next move. 
KitKat is much loved around the world and its four-finger shape is well known by consumers. 
s four-finger shape has been granted trademark registration in many countries of the world, for instance Germany, France, Australia, South Africa and Canada, further protecting it from imitations.?
As we have previously stated, we do not believe the shape of the KitKat bar should be protected as a trademark in the UK.?
