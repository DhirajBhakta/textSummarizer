Racing against time to bring a network of "high-speed corridors" on track, the Indian Railways is exploring self-propelled train sets similar to those used in Delhi Metro.This technology, experts say, will not only achieve faster acceleration of up to 160 km per hour, but also put in place advance protective measures like electro-pneumatic braking system to improve passenger safety.Senior railway officials said the prototype of the train is being manufactured at Integral Coach Factory in Chennai and the first two sets will be ready by March 2018.
