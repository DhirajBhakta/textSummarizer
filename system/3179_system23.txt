London, May 29 (PTI) Scientists are building the worlds first wind farm powered by giant kites in Britain that could generate enough electricity to run 5,500 homes. 
As many as twenty kites flying higher than Britains tallest building will work in pairs to generate electricity. 
The kites take turns to fly out and back, ensuring that the power supply is constant. 
The company plans to build ten 500kW systems about 600 metres apart at a site by the year 2020.
