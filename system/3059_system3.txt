Is it a boy or a girl Sonia Prajapati, 25, says she gave birth to a son on June 2 at Delhi's Safdarjung Hospital. 
She and her husband are now waiting for the report of a DNA test to end the mystery and their anguish.The hospital says the results would be in its favour and denies any possible baby switch. 
The DNA reports are likely to come in 20 days and till that time the baby girl is being kept in our nursery and looked after by the nursing staff," he said.Dr Rai added that on June 2, only two boys were born at the hospital and the rest were girls. 
"At 11am, a patient delivered a baby boy, who was premature and was sent to the nursery and the other male child was born at around 4pm, after the allegations made by Sonia (the patient) over exchange of babies," he said. 
In this whole scenario, it's the baby girl who is suffering and being kept away from her mother since birth, which is the golden period for any newborn," said Bansal.
