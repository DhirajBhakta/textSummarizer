Due to severe shortage of cleaning staff, students of Rajasthan's Bharatpur district government school are often seen holding brooms instead of books in the premises. 
There are 232 schools in four divisions in the district, all of whose positions for class four type employees amounts to 368. 
But the education department in defence says that they have been providing Rs 500 each month (typically for 10 months) to every school that is facing crunch of sweepers. 
However, there is a shortage of cleaning staff," said Anil Kumar Aggarwal, Deputy District Education officer.
