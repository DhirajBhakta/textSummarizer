Morning walkers on the beach of temple town Puri were in for a shock on Monday when they discovered the body of a dead whale that had been swept ashore by the waves.The 30-feet-long carcass was seen lying on the beach near the Pantha Niwas. 
Earlier in February, another such whale carcass was found at Puri's Balukhanda beach.Last year, in December another 42-foot-long whale carcass was recovered from the Baidhara Pentha beach in Puri.Scientists are worried about the trend given the sudden rise in the number of such mammals being killed.
