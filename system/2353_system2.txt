Kim Clijsters (@Clijsterskim) July 14, 2017When it was her turn to serve, Kim asked the audience what kind of serve she should make ? 
The man, sitting close to the court, was loud enough to be heard when he shouted ?
Clijsters checked with him whether he had actually said that, and once convinced, she invited him to the court which he duly accepted. 
As the man came on to the court and Clijsters prepared to serve, she stopped and ran towards one of the kit bags. 
The four-time grand slam champion took out a white skirt and asked the fan to put it on. 
he also managed to return a Kim Clijsters?
