In the first phase of the project, only 10 villages are involved with the land spread over 3,100 hectares. 
Activists claimed despite scaling down the project, the 78 villages were not denotified, raising questions over the intent of the government. 
The farmers have alleged the Maharashtra government has acquired around 1,000 hectares in Roha and Mangaon tehsils of Raigad and is looking to forcibly acquire the rest.
