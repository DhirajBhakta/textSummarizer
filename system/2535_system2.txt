Veteran actor Mithun Chakraborty says stand-up comedian Kapil Sharma is one of the biggest talents he has seen in his career. 
s comedy show will air on the same channel, Sony, which has The Kapil Sharma Show.Krushna and Kapil are often pitched as competitors. 
I have no idea about it (referring to competition between the two comedians on Colors channel). 
But I feel no one should compare. 
Kapil is one of the biggest talents I have seen in my film career, he is very talented. 
The actor, however, says the comedy show cannot be termed a comeback as he was continuously getting a lot of offers. ?
