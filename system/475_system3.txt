Broken benches, damaged floodlights and scratched plaques  this was the sight of Rezang La war memorial in Palam Vihar on Tuesday morning when members of the Martyrs family welfare foundation visited the site to plan celebrations ahead of the Kargil Vijay Diwas on Wednesday.We were shocked to look at the site. 
A majority of war heroes of the 13th Kumaon Regiment were from south Haryana districts of Gurgaon, Rewari and Mahendragarh.This sad state of affairs show how much we respect their sacrifices, he added.Veteran allege that the memorial becomes a picnic spot for drunk men and miscreants every night.
This was not one persons or one associations property, it is the countrys heritage, said Col (retd) Mahavir Yadav, a member of the association.Rao, who served in the Indian Army for years and was a part of Kargil war, said that it could not be work of just two-three men, but a group who had come solely with the purpose of destroying the great memorial.He alleged that the vandalism was a result of a complaint he had filed at the chief ministers window on Monday against a wine shop in the vicinity of the memorial. 
The wine shop is next to a hospital and very near to the school as well, Rao said.The veteran said that the memorial becomes a picnic spot for drunk men and miscreants every night.
