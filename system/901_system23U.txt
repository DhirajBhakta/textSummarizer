 IndiGo revoked on Wednesday a ban on TDP parliamentarian JC Diwakar Reddy who manhandled the airlines staff at the Vishakhapatnam airport last month after being denied boarding for arriving late for a flight.The decision came after Reddy met officials from the airline in a meeting in New Delhi set up by Union minister for science and technology, YS Chowdary. 
The issue is amicably resolved between the two sides and IndiGo decided to lift the said ban with immediate effect, a statement from the airline said.
