Washington, Feb 27 (PTI) NASA plans to send its first robotic spacecraft to the Sun next year that is slated to get within six million kilometres of the blazing star to probe its atmosphere. 
"This is going to be our first mission to fly to the Sun," said Eric Christian, a NASA research scientist at Goddard Space Flight Centre. 
"We cant get to the very surface of the Sun," but the mission will get close enough to answer three important questions, Christian said. 
First, the mission will hopefully unveil why the surface of the Sun, called the photosphere, is not as hot as its atmosphere, called the corona. 
According to NASA, the surface temperature of the Sun is only about 5,500 degrees Celsius. 
"The Sun blows a stream of charged particles in all directions at a million miles an hour.
