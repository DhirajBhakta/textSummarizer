However, swift action by Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) led to their arrest at Mumbai airport.The diamond, worth Rs34 lakh, was recovered from a bottle of shampoo.The CISF later also provided security at the India International Jewellery Show (IIJS)-2017, which was being held at Bombay Exhibition Center, Goregaon. ?
Once it was established that they had left, their passport details, registration details and photographs were taken from the council and sent to the Foreigner Regional Registration Office (FRRO) Mumbai and CISF?
the officer said.Because the size of the diamond was small, the X-ray machine could not detect it and therefore, they were then interrogated with the help of a Chinese interpreter, after being off-loaded from the plane.During interrogation, they revealed that the diamond was concealed in a small shampoo bottle, which was subsequently recovered.
