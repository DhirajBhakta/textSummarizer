"The scheme of providing free power connection to the BPL card holders has been launched at 624 places across the state," he said. 
Sharma said the scheme would also benefit the poor people who do not have BPL cards at present. 
Sharma said while the Centre had launched the free gas connection scheme for the poor, the Yogi Adityanath government in Uttar Pradesh is giving free power connection to the same class of people.
