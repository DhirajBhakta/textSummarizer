? These were the questions fired at Sreelakshmi Satheesh, CEO of an educational consultancy firm in Kerala and a motivational speaker, when she attended a call from an unknown number.? Since then, her phone rang a number of times, all unknown numbers. 
She turned her phone on, dialed one of the numbers from which she had gotten a call earlier and spoke to the fellow who answered with nauseating enthusiasm. 
He shuddered when Sreelakshmi told him about her profile and soon began begging for forgiveness. 
She had only one demand -- the man should be expelled from the party -- and as proof, she asked for the party meeting minutes where the decision is taken. 
?Unable to control her anger, Sreelakshmi narrated the entire episode in a Facebook post, and the post soon went viral with over 1,317 shares, 1.200 comments and 4,500 likes.
