Pope Francis has lambasted media organisations that focus on scandals and smears and promote fake news as a means of discrediting people in public life. 
It is a sin to defame people, he added.Using striking terminology, Francis said journalists and the media must avoid falling into coprophilia  an abnormal interest in excrement. 
And since people have a tendency towards the sickness of coprophagia, a lot of damage can be done.He also spoke of the danger of using the media to slander political rivals.
