Sonam Kapoor is hailed as the diva that made the whole Hindi-movie industry more fashion conscious than ever before. 
Now, this diva is giving the country and her fans some perspective by auctioning out just the things that earned her the 'dive' tag, because it's all for a good cause.Last year, the Delhi 6 actress was appointed as the goodwill ambassador for Mumbai-based NGO, Fight Hunger Foundation. 
Now, she's all set to auction her bags and designer clothes for the benefit of this NGO, which she says is very close to her heart.
