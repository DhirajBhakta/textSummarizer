 The state government has planned to implement cycling tracks along the arterial roads in 10 leading cities of the state. 
The state public works department will test the project, dubbed streets with cycle tracks in Pune, Nagpur, Nashik, Amravati, Chandrapur, Kolhapur, Solapur, Latur, Aurangabad and Jalgaon, on roads under the departments jurisdiction. 
The committee will identify arterial roads where cycle tracks can be set up depending on the availability of space and the scope for cycling.
