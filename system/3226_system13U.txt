And now a day after the makers of Magadheera approached the Hyderabad court to seek injunction against the release of Raabta, its makers have come in defense of their film. 
We find it extremely unsavoury and disrespectful when people from the industry belittle someone's hard work by using words like "copied", "plagiarised" nonchalantly and jump to conclusions merely on the basis of a 2 minute and 14 second trailer, without verifying the facts or waiting for the film to release for the public to give its verdict."
