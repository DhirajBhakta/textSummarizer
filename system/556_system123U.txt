Adam Peaty surprised even himself after improving his own 50 metres breaststroke world record by almost half a second in one day at the world championships in Budapest on Tuesday.The Olympic champion won 100m breaststroke gold on Mondays second day and vowed there would be something special over one length on Tuesday. 
But even the 22-year-old did not expect what happened  a 0.47sec improvement on the world record of 26.42sec he set in winning the 50m title in Kazan, Russia in 2015.Peaty clocked 26.10 in the morning heat, 0.44 ahead of his nearest rival, and improved his mark to 25.95 in the evening semi-final, 0.73sec clear of the field.I didnt think I was going to do that, said Peaty, who shook his head in disbelief after seeing his time.
