"When a film doesn't do the kind of business or get the appreciation it should get, it's heartbreaking. 
But I am sure when we work together again we will do something great," the actor said.Shahid added that the failure of the film was not on him. 
"Rangoon as a film had many energies and many people. 
I can't take ownership of the film. 
I am happy my part was appreciated but I am sad for the film not doing well," he said.Shahid will be seen next in Sanjay Leela Bhansali's Padmavati, which also features Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh.
