More than five weeks after it announced an interim loan of Rs10,000 to facilitate sowing of kharif crop until the actual waiver is credited in farmers? 
Taking note of the poor response, several district central cooperative banks (DCCBs) have published advertisements in newspapers, urging farmers to avail the loan. 
There is poor response to the interim waiver scheme. 
There was a delay in issuing directives to the district banks, but now the Maharashtra State Cooperative Bank has written to all DCCBs, saying it will avail the finances for such loans,? 
I think farmers are now waiting for the actual farm waiver than going for an interim offer.?
The state took 25 days to extend guarantee to the banks for the loan that was announced on June 11.
