London, Mar 10 (PTI) The worlds oldest known crocodile eggs laid some 152 million years ago have been discovered in the cliffs of Portugal. 
The remarkably well preserved eggs give an insight into the "mother croc" that laid them, researchers said. 
They are similar to the eggs of modern crocodiles, suggesting crocodile eggs have changed little in shape in the last 150 million years.
