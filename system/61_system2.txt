Indian authorities have removed a copy of the Bible and the Quran from a new statue of a former president after a complaint by a Hindu nationalist party, officials said Tuesday.The removal of the books has fuelled a religious row over a carving depicting a Hindu holy book placed next to the statue of APJ Abdul Kalam at Rameswaram in the southern state of Tamil Nadu.Kalam, who as a scientist played a leading role in Indias landmark 1998 nuclear weapons tests, was president from 2002-2007 and a strongly secular figure.The sculpted Hindu Bhagvad Gita book was placed next to the statue before it was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi last week on the second anniversary of Kalams death.Relatives placed the Bible and the Quran next to the Gita in protest.
