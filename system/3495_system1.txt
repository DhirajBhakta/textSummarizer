Bhopal, May 2 (PTI) The Madhya Pradesh Cabinet today gave an in-principle nod to granting the status of "living human entity" to Narmada river, over a month after the Uttarakhand HC accorded the status to the Ganga and Yamuna rivers. 
Participating in the Namami Devi Narmade Seva Yatra in the state last month, Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh had suggested the MP government bring a bill in the Assembly to accord the living entity status to the river.
