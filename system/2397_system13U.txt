These youngsters are basically from economically weaker sections and resort to crimes because of lack of resources to earn a living, says Madhur Verma, DCP (Crime) and PRO, Delhi Police. 
Usually such training used to take place at one centre in the city but this time, we have designated several centres including 20 police stations, adds Verma. 
						A spokesperson from NSDC, who is managing the project, says, We are providing skill training to the offenders to align them to the main stream.
