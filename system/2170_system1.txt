 After receiving complaints from commuters that drivers do not stop buses at designated stops, the Delhi government has decided to install CCTV cameras at bus stops.Not halting the bus at the designated spot but close to the bus stop not only leads to chaos and congestion on roads, but it also poses a challenge to the differently abled, senior citizens, women and children.?
another official said.At present, the capital has 1,864 bus queue shelters (BQS), of which 1,321 are managed by the Delhi Transport Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited (DTIDC), 346 by the Delhi Integrated Multi-Modal Transit System (DIMTS) and 197 by the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC).The practice is so common among drivers of the government-run buses that the transport department is already carrying out a drive to prosecute them.
