Maharashtra has become the first state to make social boycott a crime after President Pranab Mukherjee cleared the legislation. 
It aims to prevent atrocities carried out by extra-judicial courts and caste panchayats. 
The bill was cleared by the state legislature in April and was sent to the President for his approval. 
The Act has been cleared by the Central government. 
We believe the Act is a tribute to Narendra Dabholkar, who had started the fight.READUnfortunate that cops ignored testimony: Hamid DabholkarDabholkar murder: CBI to produce Tawade in court on June 16
