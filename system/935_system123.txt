A Somerset cheesemaker has offered a ?500 reward after two of its finest vintage cheddars were stolen during a prestigious show. 
The judges at the Yeovil show had crowned the two hefty blocks of cheese champion and reserve champion and the specimens were being left in a marquee overnight so that they could be admired by members of the public next day.
