The National Democratic Alliances (NDA) presidential candidate Ram Nath Kovind visited Mumbai on Saturday for a brief campaign stop, ahead of Mondays election. 
Kovind spoke to MPs and legislators from the BJP and its allies in the state, including Shiv Sena, at Churchgates Garware Club. 
Sena MPs and ministers attended the function, ending speculation about the party top brass being miffed over Kovind not meeting Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray during this visit.
