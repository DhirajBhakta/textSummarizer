Stewart, after reaching 73 from 76 balls, skied Paul Strang to Campbell, and Hussain departed without scoring as he slapped the leg-spinner to cover, second ball.Whittall, riskily introduced with four overs left, caused Crawley to slice to deep cover; Thorpe's leg-side shot lobbed into the offside; England's chance had slipped away.
