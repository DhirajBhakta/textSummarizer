How a party can clean Delhi if it cannot get rid of mosquitoes in 10 years And if you vote BJP, then in the coming 5 years, there will be so much garbage in Delhi that people will have dengue and chikungunya."
I want to tell the people of Delhi that BJP and Congress workers have stolen oil from 70 places, and at many places they have put cement in sewer pipelines because of which water is flowing on roads at some places.
