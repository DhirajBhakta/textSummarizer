Los Angeles, Mar 5 (PTI) "House of Cards" creator Beau Willimon wants Twitter to delete Donald Trumps account and even shared a 16-point argument as to why the President "should be removed" from the micro-blogging website. 
He also pointed out that if people argue that removing his account is "violation of free speech" then consider how "the White House has retaliated against the press by selectively locking them out, called them the enemy of the people and ignored hard questions."
