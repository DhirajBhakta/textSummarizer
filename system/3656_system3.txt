New Delhi, Apr 22 (PTI) Top industrialist Ratan Tata today praised the judicial process for its "professionalism and fairness", days after the NCLT rejected Cyrus Mistrys plea against Tata Sons. 
Following the ouster of Mistry as Tata Sons Chairman in October last year, there has been lot of acrimony between him and the Tatas. 
Earlier this week, the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) dismissed Mistrys petition against the group. 
Asserting that it is not about winning or losing, Tata said in a tweet, "it is all about the pride one gets in witnessing the high integrity of our judiciary, the fairness and the competence of everybody in the process". 
He also said that fairness and justice, if upheld, will make the nation "great".
