We have identified two plots near Okhla and Janakpuri (west) metro stations. 
We will construct 460 flats in Janakpuri and 90 in Okhla. 
The flats will be allotted on the basis of a draw and people can apply as soon as we open the scheme. 
The flats will be delivered within two years, said a senior DMRC official. 
This is the first time that DMRC is constructing flats for public.
