"The scheme of providing free power connection to the BPL card holders has been launched at 624 places across the state," he said. 
Sharma said the scheme would also benefit the poor people who do not have BPL cards at present. 
"Such people would have to pay between Rs 80 to Rs 120 for getting the power connection," he said. 
"The scheme would also provide relief to the middle class people as the instalment payment facility would be admissible for them," the minister said.
