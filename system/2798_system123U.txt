New Delhi, Jun 28 (PTI) An employees union of Air India today met NITI Aayog chairman Arvind Panagriya and demanded that the government waive the airlines debt, instead of selling it to a private player. 
However, the move may have come a little too late as hours later the Union Cabinet gave its in-principle approval for the disinvestment of Air India.
