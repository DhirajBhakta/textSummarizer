The HC has now asked the Maharashtra government to come up with a fresh, comprehensive policy to regulate adventure sports in the state.A bench of justice Naresh Patil and justice Bharati Dangre asked the government to come up with such a policy in the three months.The bench was hearing a public interest litigation highlighting inadequacies in a government resolution (GR), notified by the state in 2014, to regulate adventure sports across Maharashtra. 
The GR was issued in compliance with a previous HC order that had asked the state to evolve rules and guidelines to regulate adventure sports. 
This HC order came after a plea by the parents of a young trekker who died of a respiratory disorder during a Himalayan expedition .Earlier this month, however, a bunch of adventure sports enthusiasts and organisers brought to the courts notice through their PIL that the GR   meant to lay down guidelines and instructions for registration of organisations, agents and people who undertake adventure sports activities such as trekking, mountaineering, skiing, snowboarding, handgliding and paragliding  was not being implemented effectively.The petitioners said several provisions of the GR, especially those pertaining to registration, were impractical. 
The PIL said the government was yet to constitute the mandatory supervisory committees at the divisional and district levels across the state, as it had failed to identify a sufficient number of experts who could supervise the implementation of the GR.The state government told the court it was aware of the inadequacies in the GR and had decided to revise it.
