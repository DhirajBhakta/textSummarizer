Multiple world champion Manny Pacquiao has agreed to fight Britains Olympic silver medallist Amir Khan on 23 April, with both boxers on Sunday confirming their intentions to appear in a super fight. 
The Australian welterweights dream fight was slated for the same date in April with Brisbane a likely host, but the school teachers hopes have now been extinguished.Negotiations between team Pacquiao and team Khan have come to terms for the April 23 bout as this is what the fans wanted, Pacquiao tweeted. 
The 30-year-old Khan, who won silver as a lightweight at the Athens Olympics, has not fought since last May when he moved up two weight classes to fight middleweight Canelo ?lvarez.The much bigger Mexican proved too powerful and the Briton was knocked out in the sixth round and he is likely to drop back to welterweight to fight Pacquiao, who holds the World Boxing Organisation title at the weight. 
My team and I have agreed terms with Manny Pacquiao and his team for a super fight, Khan said on his Twitter page.
