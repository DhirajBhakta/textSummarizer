With estimated 60 per cent of toilets built under Swachh Bharat Mission lying unused, startups have come up to the rescue of the railway ministry with innovative communication module to induce behavioural changes in people. 
From national icons like Mahatma Gandhi, BR Ambedkar and Bhagat Singh to present-day heroes like Baahubali, the module uses these characters to urge people to stop littering and defecating in public.A pilot project has been launched by a behavioural intervention startup, Antyodaya Group at the New Delhi railway station which uses behavioural science to communicate the message.
