Farmers' suicide is a big political issue in Maharashtra, but dragging the 'dreamgirl of Bollywood' into the row is something what the BJP Lok Sabha MP won't like.This is what happened when Maharashtra Independent MLA Bacchu Kadu courted controversy after he dragged Hema Malini into a row over farmers' suicides."
Hema Malini drinks everyday, but does she commit suicide?" 
he asked.The MLA, who represents Achalpur (Amravati) constituency, didn't even spare Union Road and Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari. 
DNA quoted Kadu, as saying .Last year, Kadu was arrested for allegedly assaulting a government officer at the Mantralaya.BJP FURIOUS OVER KADU'S REMARKThe MLA's comments haven't gone down well with the BJP. 
Party leaders said that Kadu's statements don't just defame Hema Malini, but every women."
Malini is a well-known figure across the globe, apart from being a member of Parliament. 
These statements are uncalled for. 
Farmers commit suicide not just because of bad crops.
