Starting April 1, passengers will be able to avail the opportunity of travelling in Rajdhani or Shatabdi trains even if they had booked tickets in other mail/express trains for the same destinations. 
Railways is launching a new scheme from April as part of which wait-listed passengers can get confirmed accommodation in the next alternative train if they opt for the same while booking their tickets. 
Known as Vikalp, the alternative train accommodation scheme aims to utilise vacant berths in many premier trains including Rajdhani, Shatabdi, Duronto and other special service such as Suvidha trains in all major routes. 
MOVEPASSENGER-FRIENDLY: RAILWAY OFFICIAL?Describing the scheme as a "passenger-friendly" move to provide confirmed accommodation to wait-listed passengers in alternative trains, a senior Railway Ministry official said, "We aim to achieve the twin objectives of providing confirmed accommodation to wait-listed passengers and ensure optimal utilisation of available accommodation by this scheme."
