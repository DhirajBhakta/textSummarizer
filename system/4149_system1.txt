As per the scheme, wait-listed passengers of a train would be given the option of getting a confirmed accommodation in the next train running on the route. 
The name of the passenger who has been provided accommodation in the alternative train will not figure in the wait-listed charts of their original train, the official said, adding that a separate list of passengers transferred in the alternative train will be pasted along with the confirmed and wait-list charts.
