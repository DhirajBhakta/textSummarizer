sad? 
that the film fraternity did not express solidarity with him when Indu Sarkar was mired in controversy.
							(IANS)
It feels really sad that I as a filmmaker always stood with the film fraternity -- whether it was regarding Udta Punjab or Ae Dil Hai Mushkil or any other film... 
But they must have had their own problems. 
That?
s why you get angry when you see such selective activism,? 
Bhandarkar said at a press conference.?
Today what has happened to me, might happen with somebody else tomorrow. 
So, if you will support people as per your convenience, that won?
t work. 
Really this has saddened me as I wanted the film fraternity to come on a stage or tweet about this film, but that didn?
t happen,? 
Bhandarkar lamented.?
The kind of atmosphere that was created in Nagpur and Pune -- that?
s really sad,? 
he added about the protests in both cities. 
Earlier, veteran actor Anupam Kher, who is in Indu Sarkar too, had told IANS that a ?
united voice of the industry? 
-- much like what was raised before the release of Udta Punjab -- needed to be heard once again.Follow @htshowbiz for more
