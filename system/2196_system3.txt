t proof enough of how much the Chinese love the Bollywood star and his latest film, here is some more proof: a video made by Aamir?
We chose the song Dhaakad, because Aamirji has sung it (the actor has made his own video version, which is not seen in the film), and he is really cool in the movie, too.? 
The teams from Beijing, Shanghai, and Chengdu had even met Aamir sir, when he had come for promotions,? 
We told him about our plan to translate it for the Chinese people and he actually took out time to reply to us.
