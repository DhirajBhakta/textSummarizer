In an unfortunate series of events that unfolded in the Kashmir Valley in the aftermath of the India-Pakistan tie in the ICC Champions Trophy 2017 at Edgbaston that left the neighbours' nose bloodied, pro-Kashmir elements hacked the official website of the premier National Institute of Technology (NIT) based in Srinagar on Monday, calling for an Azaad Kashmir.NIT Srinagar became a target perhaps for the fact that it had hit headlines after a clash between Kashmiri and non-Kashmiri students last year when the latter cheered India's defeat in the T20 World Cup match against West Indies. 
We were shocked to see that the website bore anti-India literature, anti-Indian Armed Forces propaganda and a call to leave Kashmir and give it freedom," one of the students told Mail Today.WHAT THE POSTERS SAID The posters, uploaded in the name of one 'All Pak Cyber Skullz Members', said.
