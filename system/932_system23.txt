Nagaland chief minister Shurhozelie Liezietsu and nine ruling Naga Peoples Front (NPF) legislators skipped Wednesdays floor test, forcing assembly speaker Imtiwapang Aier to adjourn the special session of the House.It could not be immediately confirmed if the speaker sent a report in this regard to state governor PB Acharya. 
Acharya had summoned the special session of the assembly at 9:30am after the Nagaland bench of the Gauhati high court on Tuesday dismissed Shurhozelies petition challenging the floor test that was earlier to be held by July 15.
