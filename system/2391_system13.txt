Kriti Sanon is all set for her debut performance at the 18th IIFA awards and says she is extremely excited to perform with her Raabta co-star Sushant Singh Rajput.Sharing her excitement with ANI post the IIFA Press Conference, the 26-year-old said, I have never done a couple act before. 
Mostly the snippets are already out before the main event is aired, so this time I think it will be nice when people will not know who is actually winning which award.The MS Dhoni: The Untold Story star, on the other hand, said, I have been performing in songs with Kriti for a while now but on stage, yes, for the first time.
