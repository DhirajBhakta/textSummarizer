New Delhi, May 20 (PTI) Commerce Minister Nirmala Sitharaman today sought to calm frayed nerves on the contentious visa issue, saying the number of H-1B visas for Indian IT professionals would not come down. 
A mere 17 per cent of total US visas go to Indian companies and a number of American firms benefit from services provided by Indian firms, she noted.
