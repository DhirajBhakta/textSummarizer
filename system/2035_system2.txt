I can't pick Indians just to please you," Boycott told the audience. 
But you can't compare with today where wickets are wonderfully prepared. 
Today they would get mad if they are given wet wickets," he explained. 
Having chosen legends WG Grace and Sir Jack Hobbs as his openers, Boycott went on to pick Sir Donald Bradman and West Indian George Headley. 
Many of Boycott's choices were those of yesteryears as the greater degree of challenges they faced than the batsmen of today.
