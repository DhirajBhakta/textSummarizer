To add to Qureshi's misery, Indian team under the leadership of Salve used its full 90 minutes.Qureshi might have given "a 30 per cent reduction on his fees, besides covering the cost of two of his juniors' fees", as he claims, the bottom line is, he is being slammed in Pakistan for mishandling the case and his high fees, even at 30 per cent discount, is not giving him any room to breathe easy because Pakistan has made Kulbhushan Jadhav's case a prestige issue and the yesterday debacle saw a mourning like atmosphere there.It is true that the ICJ has given only an interim stay of Jadhav's execution and Pakistan and Qureshi say they have enough evidence to prove their case in the course of hearing, the truth of the moment is, India has scored a clear diplomatic victory over Pakistan and a moral boost for further case proceedings at the ICJ.Earlier in the day, a news came from Pakistan that it was going to have a new legal team for the case, but now Pakistan has filed a plea in the ICJ to rehear the case within six weeks with reports saying that Qureshi will continue to represent Pakistan.
