If by saying Jai Shri Ram I can do some good for the Muslims, why is there such a hue and cry, Ahmad, who has been given charge of minority welfare and sugarcane industries, told mediapersons.He would not be cowed down by such threats, he said.The minister later apologised for his statement, while talking to a TV channel.The CM told me if anybody felt hurt by my statement, I should apologise. 
My statement was distorted, he told the channel after coming out of a review meeting of the minority welfare department with chief minister Nitish Kumar.However, his phone was switched off when HT tried to contact himUpset over the slogan hailing Hindu god Ram, Quasmi said Ahmads marriage would be terminated and he would have to perform the nikah again after accepting his mistake.Imarat Shariah general secretary Anisurrehman said the organisation had not issued a fatwa but it could be a personal opinion of Quasmi.I have not talked to him.
