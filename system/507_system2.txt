						The film, based on the Emergency era, was finally cleared by the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) Revising Committee with U/A certificate, after two cuts and one disclaimer, and Bhandarkar is relieved at that.It feels really sad that I as a filmmaker always stood with the film fraternity -- whether it was regarding Udta Punjab or Ae Dil Hai Mushkil or any other film... 
Really this has saddened me as I wanted the film fraternity to come on a stage or tweet about this film, but that didnt happen, Bhandarkar lamented.The kind of atmosphere that was created in Nagpur and Pune -- thats really sad, he added about the protests in both cities.
