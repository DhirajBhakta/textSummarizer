Google has started rolling out the Android Nougat 7.1.2 update to all Pixel and Pixel XL users across the globe. 
It seems some Pixel and Nexus owners will have to make do with traditional means of unlocking the smartphone till a fix is issued.The latest iteration of Android Nougat is now also rolling out to Nexus 6P users enrolled in Google's Android Beta program. 
Rather strangely, Nexus 6P users of the Beta program were stuck on the 7.1.2 Beta release while regular Nexus 6P owners had already got the stable update.
