India's criminalisation of homosexuality did not stop a Punjab police sub-inspector from marrying a woman and that too with full Punjabi style. 
Manjit Kaur, a sub-inspector in the Punjab Police, tied a knot with a woman and it wasn't a hush-hush affair. 
In fact, India has its very own gay marriage bureau.  
Benhur Samson, an NRI, established India's first avenue where gays can find their soulmates in 2016.
