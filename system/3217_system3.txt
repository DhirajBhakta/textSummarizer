It never happened ever since the 1984 Sikh riots that I was asked to remove my turban in Gorakhpur," said a visibly moved Singh, who was also thankful to Yogi for his kind gesture.Tejpal, a resident of Gurudwara locality, was overwhelmed to know that the CM will be attending to woes of the people on Friday."
I told him that it is a kripaan - a holy sign of our religion - but he tried to pull me down," Singh narrated.However, as the media turned their cameras on me, he left me instructing a female cop to intercept me, he added."
Then an altercation took place after which I said whether you allow me to meet the CM or not, I will not take off my turban," Singh added.After all the ruckus, Singh was finally let in.
