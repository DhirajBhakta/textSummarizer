Washington, Jun 7 (PTI) Scientists have discovered a 3,000-year-old rectangular copper mask in Argentina - one of the oldest human-made metal object from South America. 
Scientists from University of Buenos Aires in Argentina also found a source of copper ore within 70 kilometres of the location where the mask was uncovered, suggesting that it was produced locally. 
The metal mask - along with a collection of human bones  was found in a tomb near a village in northwestern Argentina.
