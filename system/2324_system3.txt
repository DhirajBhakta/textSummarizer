The second day of admissions under the fourth cutoff list at Delhi University colleges also saw the colleges releasing their admission lists for seats under the Extra Curricular Activities (ECA) quota.Colleges of Delhi University, which have reserved supernumerary seats for the ECA quota, released their first ECA admission list on Friday. 
Students who have made it to the list can confirm their admission on Saturday and Monday.DU has around 56,000 seats in its 60-odd colleges with approximately 50,000 seats for merit-based courses. 
Saturday is the last day of admissions under the fourth cutoff list at DU.In addition to this, DU colleges reserve up to 5% supernumerary seats for students who have shown great prowess in extra curricular activities like dance, music, theatre, debate and any of the 12 ECA categories recognised by the university. 
However, making it to the merit list does not guarantee admission, according to Shalini, the head of ECA admissions at DU.About 865 students had gotten a seat under the ECA quota last year, and this year, the number is expected to go upto 900, according to DU sources.Students who had made it to the ECA merit lists had to approach the colleges of their choice  given that they reserve seats for the particular ECA category  and get themselves registered for admission after getting their documents verified.The colleges then prepared an admission list, based on their requirements, which was released on Friday. 
Colleges where admissions have been closed for most courses have also released the admissions list. 
At Gargi College, 39 students have made it to the first admissions list.Students who may not have made it to the ECA admissions list in the first round, have another four more rounds to go.All seats will not necessarily be filled by the end of the first cycle, as the same student may have made it to the list of multiple colleges, but would seek admission only at one. 
There will be five such admission cycles, and students will need to re-register under each cycle, if they wish to be considered for admission under that session, Shalini said.Admissions under the ECA category is expected to go on until August 10.BOX:Schedule of ECA Admissions:July 8: release of ECA merit listFirst cycle of admissions:July 11-13: Registration and verification of documents at individual colleges under first cycle of admissionsJuly 14: Colleges will issue a notification with the names of those eligible for admissionJuly 15 and 17: Students will need to complete their admission procedure at concerned colleges, if selectedSecond cycle of admissions:July 18-20: Registration and verification of documents at individual colleges under second cycle of admissionsJuly 21: Colleges will issue a notification with the names of those eligible for admissionJuly 22 and 24: Students will need to complete their admission procedure at concerned colleges, if selectedThird cycle of admissions:July 25-26: Registration and verification of documents at individual colleges under third cycle of admissionsJuly 27: Colleges will issue a notification with the names of those eligible for admissionJuly 28-29: Students will need to complete their admission procedure at concerned colleges, if selectedFourth cycle of admissions:July 31 and August 1: Registration and verification of documents at individual colleges under fourth cycle of admissionsAugust 2: Colleges will issue a notification with the names of those eligible for admissionAugust 3-4: Students will need to complete their admission procedure at concerned colleges, if selectedFifth cycle of admissions:August 5 and 7: Registration and verification of documents at individual colleges under fourth cycle of admissionsAugust 8: Colleges will issue a notification with the names of those eligible for admissionAugust 9-10: Students will need to complete their admission procedure at concerned colleges, if selected
