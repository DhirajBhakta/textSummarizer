They were led in that first battle by an ape named Caesar, who had seen the compassion mankind was capable of, but also the cruelty.Its been fifteen years since the fight on the Golden Gate Bridge, a fight the apes won, but after which they were forced to leave the dangerous cities. 
But thats what made me like it more.With this, Matt Reeves has made his fourth, unquestionably great movie.
