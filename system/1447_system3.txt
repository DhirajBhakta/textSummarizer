He calls Kaabil a "small film with a large heart". 
?You don't seem to be in a rush to have a film release a year.I actually have only done movies that I have wanted to do. 
If there were more films that I wanted to do, then I would have done them. 
Perhaps, I am looking for something that is a little rarer or I want to use my films to express my own self through my interpretations of my experiences.
