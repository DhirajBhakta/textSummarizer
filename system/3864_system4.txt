Brochures will be released next month with an application form to book a flat, which DMRC promises to deliver by 2019. ?
The flats will be allotted on the basis of a draw and people can apply as soon as we open the scheme. 
DMRC official said that notification of Ministry of Urban Development on changes in Transit Oriented Development Policy (TOD) policy has also paved way for vertical growth along the Delhi Metro corridor, which will eventually help them to use more space for commercial purpose.Under the TOD policy, a Floor Area Ratio (FAR) of 400 has been approved. 
This will enable high rises to come up in these areas and make for denser colonies.
