Priyanka Jethalal Maru planned to jump off the 18th floor of an under-construction building. 
However, officials from the Mumbai Police who reached the location dissuaded her from taking her life. 
Maru was spotted on the 18th floor of an under-construction building in Mumbai's Sewri area by a resident of a nearby apartment. 
The resident informed the Mumbai Police control room, which sent a team to the location. 
Maru, who planned on jumping off the building, was seen shooting a selfie video. 
Sharma, who is trained in handling such situations, was instrumental in dissuading Maru, news agency PTI reported. 
Maru was then taken into custody and later admitted to a hospital in Parel where she is being counseled.
