On Wednesday night, when Delhi police were grappling for clues to crack the case, Singh walked into the Najafgarh police station and offered to help the investigating officer arrest his son. 
A senior officer said that when he spoke to Singh, the man said that his duty came first and he was a cop who would treat his son like any other suspect.
