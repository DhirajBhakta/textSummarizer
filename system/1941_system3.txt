No, not the cab but the baby boy who was named after the cab company Uber. 
Uber India President Amit Jain attended the birthday celebration Uber hosted for the baby. 
On her way to the hospital, Babli gave birth to her second child in the Uber cab. 
On December 9, 2015, Khan received a request in the evening from Babli's husband to take his wife to a hospital. 
Even after refusing he reached to pick her from the location and picked her along with two other women.Post-delivery, the cab driver Shahnawaz Khan jokingly suggested that the baby could be named after the cab company, and this, Babli took rather seriously.
