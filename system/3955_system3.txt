Hyderabad, Apr 3 (PTI) Backing Infosys co-founder N R Narayana Murthys view on pay hike to COO U B Pravin Rao being "not proper," companys ex-director T V Mohandas Pai today said the salary in this case is "spectacular" but performance is not. 
Alleging that Infosys board was "misguided", Pai said the ""fundamental problem" was the pay hike given earlier to CEO Vishal Sikka "without any justification", because of which other executives were also expecting higher pay.
