Union Minister M Venkaiah Naidu may have just stoked fresh controversy over use of Hindi language. 
Venkaiah Naidu today said Hindi language is the identity of the Indians. 
"(Hindi) Hamari matribhasha hamari pehchan hai. 
Hamein ispe garv karna chahiye (Hindi is out mother tongue, our identity. 
We should be proud of it)," Venkaiah Naidu said. 
PAST CONNECTION Earlier in April, Venkaiah Naidu had defended a move by the Parliamentary Committee on Official Language proposing to make use of Hindi mandatory both in speech and writing for MPs and Union ministers, who could read and write the language.
