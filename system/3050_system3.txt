New Delhi, Jun 11 (PTI) Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi, whose three-year tenure will end on June 19, has asked the government not to consider him for reappointment to the post. 
Rohatgi told PTI that he had written to the government last month conveying his wish to discontinue as Attorney General and return to private practice. 
I consider the three-year term as enough and I had also served the previous BJP government for five years. 
Rohatgi was appointed as the AG on June 19, 2014 immediately after the BJP government came to power in May that year. 
He also defended the government which was in tussle with the Supreme Court Collegium of judges on the appointment of judges for higher judiciary.
