Barcelona suffered a shock 2-1 defeat at Deportivo La Coru?a, four days after their dramatic 6-1 Champions League win over Paris Saint-Germain. 
Zinedine Zidanes side now lead La Liga by two points and have a game in hand over Barcelona in second. 
The former Real Madrid youth trainee Joselu gave Deportivo a deserved lead in the 40th minute after an error by the Bar?a goalkeeper, Marc-Andr? ter Stegen, although Luis Su?rez equalised after 46 minutes with a powerful drilled effort.The Depor defender Alex Bergantinos headed them back in front after 74 minutes and Barcelona, who were without Neymar because of a thigh injury and clearly missed the Brazilians creative talents, failed to react.Su?rez was denied a second equaliser by a brilliant save from Germ?n Lux as Baecelona suffered a first defeat in 20 league games since being beaten 4-3 at Celta Vigo, also in Galicia, on 2 October.Depor went into the game one place above the relegation zone but are on the rise under new coach Pepe Mel, who has now taken eight points in four games since succeeding the sacked Gaizka Garitano last month.The Galicians were far from intimidated by Barcas recent run of scoring 17 goals in their previous three outings, and did not allow the champions to settle.
