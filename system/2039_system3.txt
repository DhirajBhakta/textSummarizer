Senior Congress leader Kapil Sibal today rebutted Prime Minister Narendra Modi's remarks on former premier Indira Gandhi and accused him of being unaware of the history of the country.Sibal said, "BJP is not the only nationalist party. 
For the PM to say that Congress is bigger than the country just proves that he is not aware of the history of our country. 
Sibal was replying to Modi who, earlier in the day, blamed former prime minister Indira Gandhi for causing loss to the country by not implementing demonetisation in 1971.
