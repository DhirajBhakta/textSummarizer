A BSES engineer died and four persons were injured today as their car rammed a tree while allegedly being chased by a mob during an anti-power theft drive in south west Delhi's Jaffarpur Kalan area, a BSES spokesperson said. 
The police, however, refuted the claim and said the engineer died in a suspected case of rash driving. 
According to the BSES spokesperson, three discom teams raided Jhul Jhuli village in Jaffarpur Kalan this afternoon following a tip-off about large-scale power theft in the area. 
The teams, accompanied by Delhi Police, came under attack and had to retreat, he said. 
A senior police officer said the BSES teams were provided adequate police force for the raid which went "successfully".
