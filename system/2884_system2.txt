Union Minister M Venkaiah Naidu may have just stoked fresh controversy over use of Hindi language. 
Venkaiah Naidu today said Hindi language is the identity of the Indians. 
PAST CONNECTION Earlier in April, Venkaiah Naidu had defended a move by the Parliamentary Committee on Official Language proposing to make use of Hindi mandatory both in speech and writing for MPs and Union ministers, who could read and write the language. 
Venkaiah Naidu had said that the Centre was only 'promoting' not 'imposing' Hindi on anyone. 
Venkaiah Naidu had then said that the latest notification on use of Hindi language was based on the recommendation of the Parliamentary Committee headed by the then home minister and Congress leader P Chidambaram in 2011. 
The parliamentary panel had recommended the use of Hindi by parliamentarians and ministers. 
The Narendra Modi government notified the recommendation of the parliamentary panel on March 31 this year after President Pranab Mukherjee gave his nod to the suggestion.Also Read:DMK doesn't oppose Hindi, it's only against its imposition: Kanimozhi
