The Republican Party of India (RPI) led by union minister Ramdas Athawale would start an agitation from July 25, demanding a loan waiver of Rs636 crore, which had been advanced by  state-run corporations to people from Scheduled Class and Tribes for self-employment and other reasons.According to a source, RPI party workers will agitate across the state in front of collectors? 
If the farmers can get relief, even these people who have taken loans should be let off,? 
Various state-run corporations like Annabhau Sathe Mahamandal and Mahatma Phule backward Class Development Corporation provide loans to the people belonging to the backward classes and tribes to start their own ventures at subsidised interest rates. 
This forced Fadnavis to accept their demands and he announced a mega loan waiver of Rs34,000 crore. 
Athawale is just playing to the gallery as these people are his voters, but the Government is unlikely to cede to his demand,?
