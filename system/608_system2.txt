At Defence Colony, shopkeepers have already been told to install signages of uniform sizes in one months time. 
Though as per the Delhi Municipal Act, installing signages of uniform signages outside shops is mandatory, but people dont follow it, said a senior SDMC official.Last year, SDMC had started a project of giving uniform look to eight markets across south Delhi by providing disabled friendly ramps, modern infrastructure, LED lights and car-free zones.
