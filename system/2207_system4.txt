s father, Om Prakash Sharma, was attacked by two miscreants, who stabbed him with a knife and robbed him near his shop.On Saturday night, when 68-year-old Om Prakash was closing his confectionary shop near Kathmandi in Rohtak, two youths in early their 20s came to purchase cold drinks and cigarettes. 
They first tried to take cash from my pockets. 
But when I tried to stop them, one of the boys took out a knife and tried to stab me in my stomach. 
They then entered my shop and took all the cash from the drawer. 
They took nearly Rs 7,000.?
While leaving, the miscreants locked the door from the outside leaving injured Sharma inside the shop.He called his other son, Deepak, who broke the lock and shifted Om Prakash  to a hospital. ?
