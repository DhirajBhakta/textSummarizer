A 15-year-old girl was found to be seven-month pregnant after two of her cousins allegedly raped her several times. 
She said she was first raped by her cousins in December last year when they barged into her house when she was alone. 
The police have registered a case under the Prevention of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act and other sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) against the two.
