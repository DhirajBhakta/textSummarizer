Dear producer and channel, I understand we cant make shows like How I Met Your Mother and Friends, and honestly I dont expect us to also, but for the love of god and for the reason we all got in this industry please dont sell me stupidity in the name of content which gives TRP because honestly no one is watching this, he wrote in the post.Leave aside other people, I think the fraternity only doesnt (watch the show).
