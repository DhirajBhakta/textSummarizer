Local forest department sources told Mail Today on Friday that the NHAI has chopped more than 8,000 trees to develop a flyover and three underpasses. 
Sources said the road agency has not given any blueprint about developing green channels to compensate for felled trees. 
"Trees were chopped mercilessly and many of these were fullgrown and more than 25 years old," said Vivek Kamboj, a city based environmentalist.
