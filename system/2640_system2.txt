She was brought to India after 13 long years in 2015, but has not found her family yet. 
The 24-year-old, who has hearing and speech impairment, has been staying at the Mook-Badhir Sangathan hostel Indore ever since. 
According to reports, Geeta is all set to get married now. 
Geeta will find her own groom, and Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan will solemnise the marriage, being the `Mama' (maternal uncle) of the girl", said Sushma Swaraj.Shivraj Singh Chouhan is referred to as "mama" by the girls in the state. 
Geeta had left the authorities worried, when she went missing from the hostel on Thursday. 
She was later found near Annapurna temple. 
Hostel authorities were concerned that Geeta is unhappy and wants to go back to Pakistan. 
However, Swaraj, after meeting her, clarified that she had gone to the temple to offer prayers and not because she was unhappy.
