One wouldn't be too wrong if he or she said that Jagga Jasoos has been in the making for a zillion years.Jagga Jasoos is Anurag Basu's first directorial venture after the stupendous success of 2012's Barfi! 
and it is set to release, finally, five years later in 2017.......and the makers of Jagga Jasoos launched the promotions of the film today by sharing the first poster of the Ranbir Kapoor and Katrina Kaif-starrer.Sometimes, the fastest getaway is an Ostrich!
