Intelligence agencies say stone-throwing protests in Kashmir, which picked up after militant leader Burhan Wani was killed in an encounter with security forces last July, have now spread to rural regions.Authorities are worried as they say the crowds in the countryside are more belligerent. 
An officer says boys as young as 4 and 5 are participating in the stone- pelting.After being caught, many of these kids reveal that they have no idea what they are involved in.
