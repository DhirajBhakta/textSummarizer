are trained to help deliver babies in emergency situations, and that training comes in handy every now and then. 
One recent occasion was when a woman went into labour at Old Delhi Railway Station at 4.15am; her panicked husband called the police control room. 
To cut a long story short, a PCR van (mobile patrol) arrived, and the woman delivered her baby in the van.?
While taking her to the hospital, her water broke and we had to get the baby delivered in the van itself, near Netaji Subhash Marg,? 
We have trained our staff in such a way that they can handle childbirth,? 
ve briefed our staff not to disturb the cord, giving the mother her privacy and taking the mother and baby to the nearest hospital. 
In most such cases, PCR vans come with policewomen, but this time, there were only two male police officers who handled the case. ?
s easy when we have women officers with us. 
re asked to not move the baby from his/her position, but convincing parents at that time is difficult.
