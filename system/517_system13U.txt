It is very sad and unfortunate that he did not take the name of Nehru who was a freedom fighter though he did mention his cabinet colleagues BR Ambedkar and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel in his speech, leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad told reporters after Kovinds speech.He has to protect the Constitution and rise above and think beyond party politics, Azad said.His party colleague Anand Sharma said it was wrong to compare Mahatma Gandhi with Deen Dayal Upadhyaya.It is unfortunate that in his first address he chose to equate Mahatma Gandhi with Deen Dayal Upadhyay.
