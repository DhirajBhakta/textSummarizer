Citing Pakistan's decision to sentence Kulbhushan Jadhav to death, Thackeray's Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) workers on Tuesday stormed into fashion brand Zara's showroom in Lower Parel and threw away clothes bearing Made in Pakistan tags. 
Hence, we had to protest," said Rita Gupta , MNS's general Secretary, adding "We have information about a few more stores in Mumbai who sell Pakistani goods. 
After the Uri attacks, MNS had threatened Pakistani artists and even went on to stop the release of Karan Johar's Ae Dil Hai Mushkil that starred Pakistani artist Fawad Khan. 
But, this time the MNS's move to mix up patriotism with hooliganism hasn't gone down well with many.BJP leader and fashion designer Shaina NC called this protest as a desperate move to grab headlines."
