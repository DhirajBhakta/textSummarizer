Snooty, the worlds oldest known manatee, died on Sunday at his Florida home, a day after celebrating his 69th birthday.In a statement, South Florida Museum chief executive Brynne Anne Besio said Snootys death appeared to be a heartbreaking accident and added that staff were devastated.In a press conference from Bradenton broadcast on Facebook on Sunday afternoon, museum provost and chief operating officer Jeff Rodgers said Snooty died after becoming stuck in a maintenance hatch leading off the tank he shared with three young rescued manatees, Randall, Baca and Gale.The hatch is big enough for a 1,300lb manatee to get in, Rodgers said.
