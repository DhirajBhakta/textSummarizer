If it succeeds, the east and south civic agencies could adopt the system too as previous drives to prevent people from parking illegally have flopped.The north municipality will enforce the penalty on roads 60 feet and wider, mostly near marketplaces.Delhi residents living along streets identified for the project will have to pay Rs 80 an hour for parking their cars by the roadside. 
It depends on private agencies and fellow corporations for such trucks during drives to prevent illegal parking.According to experts, the solution to traffic congestion is multilevel parking lots and discouraging people from using surface parking spaces by making them prohibitively expensive.The suggestion comes at a time the north corporation plans to double the rates for surface parking and by this month-end a pilot project will be conducted in Model Town.The success of this project may have city-wide implications.
