To make the open defecation free campaign successful and create awareness about sanitation here, the Zila Swachchhata Samiti (district committee for sanitation) has started a programme "Anokhi Amethi Ka Anokha Bhai". 
Giving details of the plan, Chief Development Officer of Amethi Apurva Dubey told PTI that 854 persons from different blocks of the district have registered themselves as "brothers" with the district committee to gift a lavatory to their sisters on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan.
