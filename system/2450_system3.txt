We only want to go for the competition.If they make it on time, the girls will watch their ball-sorting robot compete against teams from 156 other countries in the First Global Challenge.From the beginning, the Afghan girls were at a disadvantage. 
The girls had to walk to the US embassy, where they received their rejection.They cried for six hours, said Mehraban, the mentor.
