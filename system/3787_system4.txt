Taking cognisance of the increasing menace of drug and substance abuse among children in the NCR region, the Juvenile Justice Board has banned the sale of correction fluids/ whiteners, thinners/diluters and vulcanised solutions/sulochans to children below the age of 18 years unless the child is accompanied by parents/guardian, or has a letter from the school authorities signifying their assent to purchase of the same.The government of Delhi has been asked to issue a notification to this effect. 
The order also cited the 2010 notification of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare in which the government had asked to regulate the sale of thinners and whiteners to ensure that they are not used for substance abuse.Expressing it's anguish over the increasing cases of substance abuse, the Board said, " We cannot be a mere witness to this systematic ruination of an entire generation that is gradually succumbing to the grip of drugs."
