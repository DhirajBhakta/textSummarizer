As political temperature soars in Uttar Pradesh ahead of the Assembly Polls, the Jat bodies in Haryana and western UP have decided to resume their agitation for reservation from January 29. 
They have also blamed the Manohar Lal Khattar government in Haryana for not fulfiling what it had promised during the agitation in February 2016.Several districts in western UP like Saharanpur, Shamli, Mujjafarnagar, Bullandshahar, Meerut, Bagpat etc, have a large population of Jats and polarisation of these votes will be crucial for the election results.
