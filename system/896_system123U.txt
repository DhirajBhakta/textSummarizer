The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) made it clear on Wednesday that it wants to quickly get over the Anil Kumble controversy.It was the first official media interaction of skipper Virat Kohli and new coach Ravi Shastri together, before the team left for the Sri Lanka tour on Wednesday.
