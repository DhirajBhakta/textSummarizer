The usage of Hindi in Namma Metro stations is turning into a major controversy with many Pro-Kannada organiastions at loggerheads with Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL). 
Ever since the online campaign #NammaMetroHindiBeda began, activists have been warning metro officials to remove Hindi signage.On Saturday, in order to avoid any more trouble, BMRCL officials allegedly covered the Hindi letters at the metro stations' entrance displays.Metro commuters were puzzled to find Hindi signs removed or covered at Chickpete and Nadaprabhu Kempegowda Metro stations' entrance gates. 
The display boards had only Kannada and English signage. 
Both BMRCL officials as well as Pro-Kannada organisations claim innocence over this act.ENGLISH OK, HINDI NOT OKPraveen Shetty, Karnataka Rakshana Vedike (KRV) state president said that Kannada is the language of the state and not Hindi. 
So, it is alright for Kannada and English to co-exist but not Hindi.
