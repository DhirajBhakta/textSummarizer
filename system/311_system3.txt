Three days before deadline to declare degree college results, MeritTrac, the Bengaluru-based information technology firm carrying out the on-screen assessment of answer sheets, claimed that the University of Mumbai is yet to provide them with a complete list of evaluators causing delay and snags in the assessment process.The firm said they had requested a consolidated list of all evaluators in a particular format, but the university has not given it yet. 
University officials, however, denied these allegations and claimed that the firm was handed over the required data at the beginning of the project.Speaking to HT, Nagendran S, executive vice-president of MeritTrac said to successfully implement on-screen marking process, one requires complete details about all the evaluators, including the subjects they assess.
