The man was apprehended last evening when a Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) personnel, deployed for the airports security, found him roaming suspiciously inside the terminal-III building, a senior official in airport security said. 
He told the CISF personnel that he had come to see off his mother, who was travelling to Colombo from the Indira Gandhi International Airport (IGIA), the official said.
