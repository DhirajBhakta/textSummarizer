 Even as the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) readies its plan to build a 300-acre park in Cuffe Parade much like New Yorks Central Park, it still faces stiff opposition from the citys fishermen. 
The Mumbai Metropolitan Regional Development Authority (MMRDA) has also marked plots 139 to 142 in the area as machimaar nagar and 143-145 as parking space for boats in its regional plan, Tandel said. 
The BMC says it wants to increase green cover in the city by creating a theme park.
