We started doing too many things, and all of us starting with myself and Rohit, are to blame for it.That said, there is almost no successful company on the planet, which hasn't gone through this phase in their lifetime - Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Tesla, Lego, Spicejet, you name it! 
We must do the same, and there is no doubt that with the really smart folks we have in the company, we will make it something that we are all very proud of.This also comes with some tough decisions in the short term. 
This also means more responsibility for the team members continuing on this journey with us.We believe that every resource of the company should be deployed for driving us towards profitable growth and with this announcement, both Rohit and I are taking a 100% salary cut.
