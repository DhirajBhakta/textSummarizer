Apart from the three hospitals, the government will also remodel 11 of its biggest hospitals to add these 10,000 beds.The minister also said that latest technology would be used to make the new three hospitals among the best. 
The hospital in Dwarka will be state-of-the-art with solar panels and natural sewage treatment plant, the minister said.The Dwarka hospital building has also used a base isolation system to protect it from earthquakes. 
This is a good thing because it is extremely difficult to evacuate patients from a hospital in the incident of earthquakes, said an official working on the project.The patients will likely not even feel anything if there is an earthquake. 
This is maybe the first government hospital in India to use such a technology, Jain said.
