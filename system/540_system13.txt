With a month to go for the 10-day Ganeshotsav, a Ganesh mandal coordination committee in the city has asked the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) to take the process to get permission to setup pandals online. 
?However, BMC officials said they have no plans to move the system online and all the mandals will have to go to ward offices to submit their applications.
