To address the problem, the team combined hydrogels containing high levels of water with glass fibre fabric to create bendable, yet tough materials, employing the same method used to produce reinforced plastics. 
Researchers found that a combination of polyampholyte (PA) gels, a type of hydrogel they developed earlier, and glass fibre fabric with a single fibre measuring around 10 micrometres in diameter produced a strong, tensile material.
