The situation now is that both parties have no option but to come together again," Gadkari said."
The final decision on this issue has to be taken by Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis and Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray. 
Both are mature and I am sure they will take the right decision," he said."
I feel leaders of both parties have to take a decision, showing sujh bujh (understanding) and maturity," Gadkari told a Marathi TV channel.He singled out Sena mouthpiece 'Saamana' for its targeting of PM Narendra Modi and BJP president Amit Shah."
If there has to be a friendship with us (BJP), then there has to be a check on the writings in Saamana. 
How will there be friendship when Saamana, on a daily basis, writes insulting things about the PM and our party president" he said."
