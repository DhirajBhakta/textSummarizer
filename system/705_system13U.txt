Over a hundred legislators were estimated to have cross-voted in valid votes.Those involved in the counting of votes on July 20 told HT that invalid ones were due to dots, inverted commas, circles and slants that electors erroneously used on their ballot papers. 
The BJP got one vote invalidated because the 1 was slanted by about 30 to 40 degrees and not perpendicular; the Congress got the same opportunity later.
