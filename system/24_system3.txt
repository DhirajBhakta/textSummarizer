Two people were killed when a light plane made an emergency landing on a beach near Lisbon, Portuguese authorities have said.The two sunbathers, a 56-year-old man and an eight-year-old girl, died while others ran into the sea when the plane came down on Wednesday.Hundreds of sunbathers were on the popular S?o Jo?o da Caparica beach, 12 miles (20km) to the south of Lisbon, at the time. 
The small aircraft, a Cessna, appeared to be in difficulty and wobbled as it skimmed low over the sunbathers, scattering them and spreading panic on the beach, witnesses said.The plane appeared to have a partly broken left wing, which hung lower than the right wing, according to Portuguese TV pictures.
