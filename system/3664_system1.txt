What Mother Teresa is to Calcutta's dying destitutes, Dr Murugappa Chennaveerappa Modi, 72. is to the poor blind villagers of Karnataka. 
Modi, the internationally recognised eye surgeon, has been waging a one-man war against blindness. 
In 1986, his name appeared in the Guinness Book of World Records for performing 833 eye operations in a day, the highest in the world. 
The operations were conducted in Tirupati in 1968 over 14 continuous hours. 
In his mass eye camps, apart from the 5.79 lakh operations, he has examined 50 lakh patients and given free food to over 100 lakh persons.Initially Modi had a hard time communicating his mission to the people.
