New York, May 2 (PTI) Scientists have successfully removed HIV DNA from the genomes of animals - including a humanised mice - using a powerful gene-editing tool, an advance that may help eliminate the virus in humans in future. 
Researchers, including those from Temple University in the US, build on their previous study in which they used transgenic rat and mouse models with HIV-1 DNA incorporated into the genome of every tissue of the animals bodies.
