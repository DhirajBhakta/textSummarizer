The Cambridge Montessori Preschool in Ashoka Niketan, Anand Vihar, apparently fetched a madari to cheer its kids, and had to pay for it by removing its principal after Union Minister Maneka Gandhi intervened. 
It seems the principal didn't know it is illegal to hold monkey dance shows. 
After I got a call from Maneka Gandhi herself enquiring about the incident, I found out about it and removed the Principal."
The monkey (or Rhesus Macaque) is a Schedule II animal under the Wildlife Protection Act (WPA), 1972; and poaching, hunting, or using it for entertainment invites a punishment of imprisonment up to seven years.
