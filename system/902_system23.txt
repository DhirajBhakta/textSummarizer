 The Maharashtra government has decided to increase compensation for rape and acid attack survivors to Rs10 lakh. 
This compensation, however, will be for those survivors, who have been meted with the most horrific acts of violence, including gang-rape, leading to physical and mental disability. 
Considering this, we have categorised compensation for different cases, said Vinita Singhal, principal secretary, women and child development department.In the most cruel crime, where the survivor faces permanent disability, financial assistance will be Rs10 lakh.
