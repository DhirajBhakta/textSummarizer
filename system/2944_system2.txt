To mark roll out of Goods and Services Tax (GST), the Modi government has convened a special midnight session of Parliament on June 30. 
WHAT IS GSTThe Goods and Services (GST) is an indirect taxation wherein most of the existing taxes will be merged into a single taxation system.In other words, the GST will put all taxes levied by state and Central government in one basket and merge them into a single-tax system, thus doing away with multiple taxation and promoting the concept of a common market for all.The GST Council approved a four-tier uniform tax slab of 5, 12, 18 and 28 per cent on goods and services, plus an additional cess on demerit goods such as luxury cars, aerated drinks and tobacco products.Food items will not attract any tax and have been kept in the zero-per cent slab.
