A clash of national cultures and an inability to understand each others languages threatens to make the merged Air France-KLM group of airlines unmanageable, according to a leaked internal company report.French staff in the Franco-Dutch company complain their colleagues from the Netherlands are money-grubbing, while the Dutch regard the Air France staff as aloof, according to the report.Among the petty grievances, there is irritation that a KLM employee working in Paris is charged 10 for lunch in the canteen, while an Air France colleague pays only 4.Such is the state of relations, according to the 100-page report, compiled by unions acting for staff within the group, that there are fears for the companys future.
