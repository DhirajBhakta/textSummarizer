The Bombay High Court today asked all people opposing the destruction of mangroves for Metro rail project to be pragmatic. 
A division bench of Justice V M Kanade and Justice A M Badar were hearing a petition moved by the Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation, which is in charge of constructing the rail link between Colaba and SEEPZ in Andheri, and told those opposing that "there was a need for Metro. 
The bench was reacting to the statement made by an advocate representing those opposed to cutting down of trees in the city. 
Justice Kanade said, "Metro should've been in Mumbai 30 years ago. 
The court said that thousands of people travelled between north and south Mumbai each day by local trains. 
"The Metro III project will prove very useful for these people so everyone should first consider the ground situation," Justice Kanade said.The corporation needs to cut 108 trees to construct two stations including the Bandra Kurla Complex station.
