A division bench of Justice V M Kanade and Justice A M Badar were hearing a petition moved by the Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation, which is in charge of constructing the rail link between Colaba and SEEPZ in Andheri, and told those opposing that "there was a need for Metro. 
The bench was reacting to the statement made by an advocate representing those opposed to cutting down of trees in the city. 
A lawyer for the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation told the court they had "taken loans from Japan for the contruction of Metro rail and each delay over tree cutting was causing huge losses". 
They added that they were ready to replant 4000 trees to compensate for the 108 trees they were going to uproot.
