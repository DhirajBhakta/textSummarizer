monumental mismanagement? 
In an exclusive - and his first since November 8 when he announced the banning of Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes - interview to India Today magazine, Modi said demonetisation has forced all "black money out into the open" and claimed the decision was taken "not for some short-term windfall gain, but for a long-term structural transformation"."
You must understand that we took the decision on demonetisation not for some short-term windfall gain, but for a long-term structural transformation. 
Our objective clearly was to clean our economy and society of the menace of black money, purging the distrust, artificial pressures and other ills that came with it," he said.The full interview is published in this week's India Today magazine.
