Many people counselled me about having babies, one of them was Salman," says the comedian."
Salman was one of the first stars I told about my twins. 
He was extremely happy for us," he added.On how it felt to become a father"When I first saw the twins, I didn't know how to react. 
I was scared to pick them up."
On how fatherhood has changed Krushna as a person"I've become more responsible. 
I've never been an actor who relies on his producers. 
I've always been in such a position that I can walk off anytime. 
I never had the fear of a show not working or being ousted from it. 
But after having kids, I get that feeling. 
I'm no longer as carefree, there is a fear that keeps me in check."
