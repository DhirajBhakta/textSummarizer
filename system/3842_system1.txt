The textbook, which The News Minute reports is titled Health and Physical Education Textbook, goes on to reason that even Miss World and Miss Universe beauty pageants take the 36-24-36 body shape into consideration while judging their contestants.An image of the section of the textbook comparing the physical and anatomical differences between males and females was initially posted on social media by a Twitter user named Anuj Khurana.The textbook doesn't stop at just female body shapes. 
A cursory sentence in the section on 'Differences in shape' says that when it comes to males, the 'V' body shape is considered the best.According to The News Minute, the textbook has published by the New Saraswati House and not the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT), which usually brings out textbooks used in CBSE schools.After reports of the textbook started coming to light, the CBSE issued a clarification saying schools must take responsibility if they choose to include books of private publishers in their curriculum.
