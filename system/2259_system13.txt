I feel talent does count, but for someone to observe your talent, you have to do one film and thats where luck comes in. 
The luck factor is so strong that out of those guys, only me and Naseeruddin (Shah) could make it in cinema, says Kapoor, who has been part of huge hits such as Jaani Dushman (1979), Qurbani (1980), Naseeb (1981), and Rocky (1981).Giving the example of his son Siddhanth Kapoor, who will soon make his Bollywood debut, and daughter Shraddha Kapoor, who is already 12 films old, the veteran actor says, My son has studied filmmaking, and assisted (director) Priyadarshan in films and my daughter has done nothing.
