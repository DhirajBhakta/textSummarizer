As he turns a year older on August 3, Sunil says that misses his audiences as much as they miss him.Asked about his plans, Sunil says, ?
Quite often, when you say something, it shows the other person in a very bad light, though unintentionally,? 
What you say is perceived to be the truth and how you see facts might not really be true, and can sound demeaning for the other person. 
About the news of Kapil not keeping well, owing to the dipping TRPs of his show, Sunil says, ?
I heard about this, and I can only say that he should take good care of himself.?
