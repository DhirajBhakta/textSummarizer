Maharashtra has become the first state to make social boycott a crime after President Pranab Mukherjee cleared the legislation. 
The Maharashtra Prohibition of People from Social Boycott (Prevention Prohibition and Redressal) Act prescribes a maximum punishment of three year in jail and a fine of Rs1lakh. 
It aims to prevent atrocities carried out by extra-judicial courts and caste panchayats. 
The bill was cleared by the state legislature in April and was sent to the President for his approval.
