At the Basin Bridge depot in Chennai, pillow covers were being stitched from the used bedsheets to tide over shortages.In a few cases, in the Northern Railway, used pillow covers were provided to the passengers, the report said.The audit report said there was a need for the railways to increase the pace of setting up of mechanised laundries and prescribe norms for quality standards for washed linen.A mechanism may be put in place to ensure strict compliance to norms of cleaning blankets and pillows as per required periodicity, it said.The CAG also said at many storage depots, fresh linen was stored haphazardly and was exposed to dirt and contamination.Proper storage space may be provided for storage of linen in store depots, so that linen can be issued in an organised manner, it recommended.It has also advocated providing adequate storage space for linen in coaching depots.In Western Railway, new linen was stored in a manner that they were exposed to dirt in storage depots in Mahalakshmi and Sabarmati.
