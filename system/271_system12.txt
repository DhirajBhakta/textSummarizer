Tiger recently faced flak for calling his female co-stars padding, but he later clarified that the word was used for anything outside his own zone in a film project, and that he wasnt referring to the female leads specifically.Given how protective he is, we ask why Tiger didnt fire at those who trolled Krishna for posting her topless photos on Instagram  the photos, in fact, only showed her bare back  even though his father, actor Jackie Shroff, was vocal about the matter.    
With @kishushroff  #natural #photography #portraitseries A post shared by Krishna Shroff (@kishushroff) on Aug 20, 2015 at 6:22am PDT Tiger says, I didnt take a stand because I dont see anything wrong with what my sister posted it wasnt in your face.
