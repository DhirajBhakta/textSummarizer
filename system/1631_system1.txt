"Modi's supporters call him a lion. 
But I say time is not far when Modi will have to return to his hole in Gujarat like a son of a rat," Banerjee said during a protest rally in Kolkata.Talking to India Today later, Banerjee refused to apologise for his abusive language against the prime minister and accused the media of speaking only in favour of PM Modi. 
He justified his comment stating that it was Prime Minister Modi who had started the trend of using derogatory words against Opposition leaders.Speaking at the same stage, Bengal Chief Minister and Trinamool chief Mamata Banerjee further endorsed her MP's comments against the PM.
