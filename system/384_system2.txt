External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj on Thursday directed the Indian High Commission in Islamabad to issue a visa to a Pakistani national for medical treatment in India. 
Touched by Swaraj's prompt response, Asif praised Swaraj and even said that Pakistan would have changed had she been the prime minister of her country. 
'CANNOT STOP PRAISING YOU'After Swaraj's direction to grant a visa to the patient, Asif was effusive in her praise of the external affairs minister.
