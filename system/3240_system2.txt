1000 cr Mahabharata film faces protest from pro-Hindu group.
The film, a cinematic adaptation of MT Vasudevan's book Randamoozham, is reportedly going to be made on a budget of Rs 1000 crore, the highest for any Indian film so far. 
Even before the film has gone on floors, it has run into trouble.Kerala Hindu Aikya Vedi president KP Sasikala has threatened to stall the release of the film unless the name is changed, according to a report in The News Minute. 
"A big budget film is coming from Kerala named Mahabharatham. 
We are happy but the Hindus here have a condition - only a film which is close to the story of real Mahabharatham written by Vyasan should carry its name. 
If the movie is based on Randamoozham let the name of the film also be named same. 
However, the makers of the film did not use the title 'Bible' and the makers of Mohanlal's film should follow their example.
