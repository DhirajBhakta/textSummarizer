lunches being interrupted by rowdy children has come up with a novel solution: a discount for well-behaved families.Antonio Ferrari, who owns a wine bar in the northern city of Padua that caters to families on Sundays, came up with the idea when he spotted a party of 11 at one of his tables, including five children sitting ?
Ferrari rewarded the group with a 5% sconto, and has since bestowed the same discount on two other families with well-mannered children.Ferrari told the Guardian he estimated about 30% of parents did not know how to handle their children at lunchtime, and that too often children run around the restaurant and bother other customers, forcing his waiting staff to swerve to avoid them.Long family lunches, sometimes stretching to three hours, are still an honoured culinary and social tradition in Italy, though less prevalent than they once were.
