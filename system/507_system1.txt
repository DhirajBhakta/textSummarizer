National Award winning filmmaker Madhur Bhandarkar has said he is ?
sad? 
that the film fraternity did not express solidarity with him when Indu Sarkar was mired in controversy.

It feels really sad that I as a filmmaker always stood with the film fraternity -- whether it was regarding Udta Punjab or Ae Dil Hai Mushkil or any other film... 
Really this has saddened me as I wanted the film fraternity to come on a stage or tweet about this film, but that didn?
