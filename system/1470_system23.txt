Taking stock of the air pollution in Delhi and the neighbouring states, the Supreme Court-appointed Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (EPCA) on Friday asked officials to immediately enforce the graded response action under very poor category for Delhi and moderate poor for NCR.Air quality for Delhi is very poor. 
Measures falling under this category of Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) have to be taken, EPCA member and head of Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), Sunita Narain said.The EPCA, however, in its first meeting on GRAP refrained from strict enforcements, like banning the diesel generators and hiking the parking fee  the measures that fall under the very poor category.
