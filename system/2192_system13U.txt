In fact, the Washington Post/ABC poll came close to predicting the popular vote on election day  which Hillary Clinton won by 2.5m ballots, Trump taking the White House in the electoral college  and no president has suffered such low ratings at this early stage in their tenure since such polling began in 1945.The poll also found that 63% of people thought the June 2016 meeting between senior members of Trumps inner circle, including Donald Trump Jr and son-in-law Jared Kushner, and a group of Russians including the lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, was inappropriate.On Saturday, a campaign finance report filed to the Federal Election Commission revealed that Trumps campaign committee had paid $50,000 to Trump Jrs lawyer Alan Futerfas on 27 June, 13 days before the New York Times revealed the meeting had taken place.
