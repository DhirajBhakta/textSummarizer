Former Indian captain Sourav Ganguly on Saturday regretted taking off his shirt on the Lord's balcony after India's win in the NatWest triangular series in 2002 in England, calling it a mistake.When reminded of the incident, Ganguly said it was only a way of "relieving the pressure". 
When asked if marriage is akin to captaining India since the first five years are tough, Ganguly quoted actor Shah Rukh Khan, "As SRK says, end mein sab theek ho jaata hai," bringing the house down.The former Indian skipper also said a resurgent Team India will not buckle pressure anymore. 
But today, the Indians won't buckle under pressure," the former Indian captain said.Seated with Clive Lloyd, Arjuna Ranatunga and Allan Border, who all led their respective teams to a World Cup victory, Ganguly, in his characteristic wit, shared the Indian side of the World Cup story.
