Hema Malini drinks everyday, but does she commit suicide?" 
Kadu said addressing a press conference in Nanded district.Kadu, who is not new to making controversial statements, while countering the general claims that farmers commit suicide because of their drinking habits said, "75 per cent MLAs, MPs, journalists drink... even Hema Malini drinks heavily... but have they committed suicide?"
