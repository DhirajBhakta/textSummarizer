London, Aug 1 (PTI) Renowned Harry Potter author J K Rowling has apologised for wrongly accusing US President Donald Trump of refusing to shake the hand of a 3-year-old disabled child during an event. 
Rowling came under fire for a series of now-deleted tweets in which she slammed Trump for seeming to ignore Montgomery Weers outstretched hand. 
Multiple sources have informed me that that was not a full or accurate representation of their interaction," Rowling tweeted. 
"I very clearly projected my own sensitivities around the issue of disabled people being overlooked or ignored onto the images I saw and if that caused any distress to that boy or his family, I apologise unreservedly," she wrote. 
"If someone can please get a message to JK Rowling: Trump didnt snub my son & Monty wasnt even trying to shake his hand," Kelly wrote on Facebook.
