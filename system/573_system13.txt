Saudi Arabia and its allies on Tuesday announced they had blacklisted charity groups and individuals with ties to Yemen, Qatar and Libya, labelling them terrorist over suspected ties to Islamist extremism. 
Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt released a joint statement naming nine charity organisations and nine individuals directly or indirectly linked to Qatari authorities as terrorist, according to a statement carried by the SPA state news agency.
