They have also blamed the Manohar Lal Khattar government in Haryana for not fulfiling what it had promised during the agitation in February 2016.Several districts in western UP like Saharanpur, Shamli, Mujjafarnagar, Bullandshahar, Meerut, Bagpat etc, have a large population of Jats and polarisation of these votes will be crucial for the election results. 
Polling in these districts is scheduled in first and second phase.BJP is already feeling the heat over demonetisation and if Jat community would go against the party, it will badly hit political equations for BJP. 
Hindu Jats and Muslims have significant numbers in these districts and they have the capability to turn election results in favour of particular party. 
SP, BSP and especially Ajit Singh's RLD are keeping close watch over the development in Haryana. 
They made false promises and convinced us to end agitation. 
It has been nearly one year but the promises remain unfulfilled.
