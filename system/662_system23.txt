Molt, one of eight Humboldt penguins brought to the Byculla zoo from South Korea, turned 2 on Friday. 
Molt strutted across the penguin enclosure, swam, ate his birthday cake and frolicked with the other six Humboldts.Mr Molt takes a break from the group and chills in the pool.
But ever since the zoo opened the penguin enclosure, the seven others  Bubble, Mr Molt, Flipper, Donald, Daisy, Popeye and Olive, have stolen hearts.
