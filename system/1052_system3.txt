On a day when Mumbai went to the polls and recorded its highest voting percentage, author Shobhaa De tweeted an image of an overweight man in uniform and mocked the city police's 'heavy' arrangements. 
pic.twitter.com/sY0H3xzXl3And here's the message tweeted by the Mumbai Police, and pinned to De.We love puns too Ms De but this one is totally imisplaced. 
Some marked the tweet to the Mumbai Police, who took it seriously and responded promptly.Mumbai police sources said the photograph De posted was giving the department a very bad name, and that it was a question of its image. 
In her tweet she said that she did not intend to offend the police force.
