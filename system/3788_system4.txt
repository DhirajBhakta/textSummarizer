re going to get through this and we want to get through it with you?. 
I thought you made a good point in that meeting and helped us make a better decision.? 
m hoping that this book helps people stop judging people who date [after the loss of a partner], particularly women, because women get judged more harshly,? 
Men date sooner, men date more, and women get judged more. 
But the process of dealing with the loss of her husband and best friend had given her life a deeper meaning, and more perspective on life?
I would definitely choose to be before, so I could get Dave back.
