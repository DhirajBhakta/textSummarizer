 Even as the debate over menstrual leave is causing a stir in the country, a Shiv Sena corporator wants it to be made mandatory. 
The corporator, Sheetal Mhatre, tabled a proposal in the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), demanding that government, semi-government and private organisations grant leave to women employees on the first day of their periods. 
Taking a cue from countries such as Japan and Italy, an organisation based in Mumbai recently decided to  give off on the women an option to take off on the a paid leave on the first day of their period. 
Experts from Akshara, a non-government organisation working for equal rights for women, however said that the proposal was not a great idea.
