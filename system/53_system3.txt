Allegations that British American Tobacco was involved in bribery and corruption in Africa are being investigated by the Serious Fraud Office, despite the cigarette companys attempts to downplay the significance of a whistleblower who handed over a dossier of evidence.BAT, now the largest tobacco company in the world after the recent merger with Reynolds, has consistently denied the allegations of Paul Hopkins, whom it employed in Africa for 13 years. 
When Hopkins handed over a large number of documents to the SFO in December 2015, BAT dismissed him as a rogue former employee.The company later toned down its criticism, stating that it had appointed a team of external legal advisers to investigate the charges.The SFOs inquiries have now become a formal investigation. 
It invited members of the public to come forward with any evidence they might have.The news follows a major Guardian investigation revealing that BAT and other multinationals have used threats against at least eight African nations, demanding they axe or dilute the kind of tobacco control measures that have saved millions of lives in the west.BAT said it continued to conduct its own inquiries into Hopkins charges. 
We note, with interest, that BAT have abandoned their earlier PR strategy of trying to shoot the messenger, he said in a statement.Paul Hopkins blew the whistle during his time at BAT and their internal team ignored him. 
The SFO must leave no stone unturned.Matthew Myers, the president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, called on the US government to also investigate BAT. 
The allegations against British American Tobacco are serious and should be investigated and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law, he said.As British American Tobacco now operates the largest publicly traded tobacco company within the United States, we urge the US Department of Justice to also investigate the companys alleged misconduct.The BAT chief executive, Nicandro Durante, told the Financial Times in March that the firm would act in a very strong way if wrongdoing was found to have taken place. 
He said: We are in 200 countries, so I cannot give a 100% guarantee that everythings going to go by the book.The SFO investigation is another blow to the company, after the US health watchdog, the Food and Drug Administration, announced tighter regulations on the tobacco industry, which hit shares in tobacco firms.
