The Gurugram Police has arrested actor Bidisha Bezbaruah's husband a day after she was found dead under mysterious circumstances. 
The 30-year-old actor and singer, who was seen in the recently released film Jagga Jasoos with Ranbir Kapoor, allegedly committed suicide at her residence in the posh Sushant Lok area of the city. 
"The victims father claimed in his complaint that she had a love marriage but would often have quarrels with her husband," Saharan said.
