The legal proceedings are all over, and the Bandra family court today granted Malaika and Arbaaz a divorce.It was last November that Malaika and Arbaaz filed for a divorce by mutual consent. 
The two went to the court too today in the same car.While Malaika has got custody of the couple's son Arhaan, Arbaaz has been granted visitation rights whenever he wants, says a report in Mid-Day. 
We have got a child and our families are involved, but just because we have not said anything till now, it doesn't give anybody the license to speculate on any rubbish about us," added Malaika and Arbaaz.Months of rumours and speculation preceded Malaika and Arbaaz's announcement of separation. 
They said, "We are not separated because of a third random person, like there were stories of a friendship between a businessman and Malaika.
