Known as Vikalp, the alternative train accommodation scheme aims to utilise vacant berths in many premier trains including Rajdhani, Shatabdi, Duronto and other special service such as Suvidha trains in all major routes. 
As per the scheme, wait-listed passengers of a train would be given the option of getting a confirmed accommodation in the next train running on the route. 
The name of the passenger who has been provided accommodation in the alternative train will not figure in the wait-listed charts of their original train, the official said, adding that a separate list of passengers transferred in the alternative train will be pasted along with the confirmed and wait-list charts.
