Bored in confines of a sprawling resort in Bengaluru, the Congress flock of 44 MLAs is a frustrated lot now. 
Following strict orders of the Karnataka Power Minister DK Shivakumar, the MLAs are not allowed to venture out in the city. 
But few defiant MLAs did head out in the city for sightseeing, shopping, to visit temples, much to the dismay of those still under curbs.
