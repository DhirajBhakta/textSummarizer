To make Indian soldiers conversant with the Chinese language, the Visva-Bharati University has started a certificate-level course recently.  
The university's "Cheena Bhavan" has been entrusted with the task of teaching the language to the soldiers, officiating vice-chancellor of the university Swapan Kumar Dutta said. 
"This is a certificate course in Chinese (Mandarin) which started recently and 25 Army personnel have been admitted for the course this year", Dutta told PTI. 
"Aimed at mental enrichment of the army personnel, the course imparted by teachers of Cheena Bhavan will introduce them with the rich Chinese culture and the centuries-old tie between the two nations," he said.Also read: Is China using its One Belt One Road initiative as an alibi to meddle in Kashmir dispute? 
The eligibility criteria remained the same as general students enrolled for the course. 
Since it was not feasible for the army personnel to attend classes in the Visva-Bharati Campus, the course is being taught at an army establishment.
