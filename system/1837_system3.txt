After our online system of seeking appointments at Motor Licensing Offices (MLOs) and payments was streamlined, the number of applications has increased to more than 700 in a single day, a government official said.In a bid to introduce cashless transactions in its daily functioning, the transport department on Tuesday installed point of sale (POS) devices at all its 13 MLOs, enforcement offices and headquarters. 
The project is being implemented immediately also because of the cash crunch that followed the Centres demonetisation of old 500 and 1,000 currency notes.The department received 66 transactions through different POS devices on Tuesday.
