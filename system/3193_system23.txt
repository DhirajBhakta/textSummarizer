A Facebook video showing a newborn baby girl walking just minutes after her birth in a hospital in Brazil has gone viral on social media. 
The midwife is then seen lifting the baby up and returning the infant back to the original position but in an astounding burst of strength, the little girl refuses to lie down on her front, pushes up onto her legs and resumes her astonishing journey across the neonatal table once again.
