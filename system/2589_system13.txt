With just 30% degree-college teachers reporting for paper assessment, the University of Mumbai (MU) will issue notices to teachers who are yet to start assessment .An official, who is involved in MUs assessment exercise, said the notice will inform the teachers the consequences of skipping assessment work. 
The colleges must at least take the responsibility of evaluating the equivalent of their own students papers, said the official.While the university wants to get the teachers involved in assessment work, many of the teachers, especially those appointed on contract basis, are yet to receive their assignments from the university.
