Virat Kohli, who took over as captain, said he hoped Dhoni would play fearlessly after the shedding the burden of leadership. 
I wanted him to have some time and then I decided it was time to move on and give Kohli the full captaincy.- As a wicketkeeper, I will have to keep a close eye as to what the skipper really wants "I don't believe in split captaincy. 
You have to see who can win big games for you - Always thought there were too many press conferences.
