The Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) will recruit 5,000 religious soldiers in the district who will fight like commandos. 
They will be selected from among trained Bajrang Dal activists and will be responsible for controlling cow smuggling and love jihad. 
This decision was taken at a VHP meeting held in Aligarh on July 14-16, in which the outfits international president Pravin Togadia was also present.
