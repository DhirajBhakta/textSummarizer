However, the technology would need to be developed further still, he added.For this to be possible, several challenges need to be overcome, such as enhancing the sensitivity and stability of the sensor bacteria, improving scanning speeds to cover large areas, and making the scanning apparatus more compact so it can be used on board a light unmanned aircraft or drone.The university said in a statement: This appears to be the first demonstration of a functional standoff landmine detection system.
