In her career spanning 15 years, it seems that the singer has learnt to trust the listeners with their changing demand for music and thats certainly worked in her favour.Every time I have sung from my heart and not thought about the commercial aspect, it has done really well for me. 
I think we underestimate the audience of our country or for that matter worldwide, by thinking that they dont understand art.They are the reason art exists, says Shreya.The singer, who has done playback singing for several Bollywood films and has given hits such as Bairi Piya, Chalo Tumko Lekar Chale, Deewani Mastani and Hangover, says she doesnt like to think much about whether the film will be a success or not.Right now, I am doing everything and trying everything. 
Sometimes, I make sure that I dont think about whether a song will do well or not, she adds.After singing countless tracks in films as a playback singer, Shreya has launched her first independent track Dhadkane Azad Hai. 
She feels this was the right time for her to take a step towards solo tracks.It came from my heart that I should go independent from films.
