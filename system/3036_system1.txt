He was awarded seven years rigorous imprisonment but that has been reduced to two years by the service," an IAF officer said.The IAF officer was a transport pilot and used to fly Antonov-32 cargo planes before he suffered an injury to his knee during a sports event after which he had to be grounded by the service.The charges leveled against the officer in the GCM included refusal to eat food, assaulting a senior officer during his custody in a missile base in Mumbai and stealing TV remote controls from the officers' mess, sources said.The officer had won a gold medal for the IAF in a national shooting championship and had claimed during his trial that he has been facing harassment and was victimised by his superiors since 2013 after he suffered a grievous knee injury after which he was transferred to Bhuj air base in Gujarat.The officer had earlier claimed that his career has been destroyed due to denial of proper treatment by superiors.
