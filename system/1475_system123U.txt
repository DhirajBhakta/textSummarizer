For ASI Raj Singh, 52, his son was guilty of stabbing a woman who spurned him and had to be brought to justice. 
Singh knew his son deserved to be behind bars and had even threatened his relatives against helping, Amit, evade arrest. 
On Wednesday night, when Delhi police were grappling for clues to crack the case, Singh walked into the Najafgarh police station and offered to help the investigating officer arrest his son.
