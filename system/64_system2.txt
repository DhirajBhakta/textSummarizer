While the first phase of the project faced opposition from some citizens and activists, Juhu residents said they welcome the beautification work.
?According to a plan proposed by BJP legislator Ameet Satam, each of the eight access points to the beach will have 5m high walls, bollards to restrict vehicles, ramps and steps with railings, welcome signs and a few lights.  
?Satam estimated the redevelopment of the access points to cost Rs80 lakh, under a Rs12-crore Juhu beach tourism plan.
