States with overcrowded prisons may contact Indias youngest state that plans to rent out next year its jail cells at Rs 10,000 a month for each prisoner.The offer is not for everyone. 
The jail-share scheme is restricted to convicts of non-grievous and non-serious offences. 
Tenants cannot be undertrials and hardcore criminals.Norway, where the crime rate has gone down considerably, started this practice of letting its prisons to neighbouring countries facing space shortage for prisoners. 
We want to adopt this, director general of prisons VK Singh said on Thursday.Read more: Tales from former inmates: What life is like in a womens jail in IndiaTelanganas 50 jails can accommodate 6,848 prisoners. 
So, theres lodging space for around 800 more.Singh said the scheme could begin next year after making space for at least 2,000 renter-prisoners.We arent in a hurry. 
On food alone, the states spend Rs 80 a day on each prisoner every weekday and Rs 100 on Sundays and holidays, when a non-vegetarian fare is served.A number of reform-oriented programmes such as Maha Parivarthan, Vidya Danam and Unnati brought down the number of jailbirds or repeat-offenders in the past three years, Singh said.
