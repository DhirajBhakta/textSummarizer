The script of the current unrest seems similar to last year's Jawaharlal Nehru University controversy when a group of students was alleged to have raised anti-national slogans. 
However, JNU student leader Kanhaiya Kumar raised no anti-India slogans for which he was charged with sedition last year, top officials investigating the case have revealed to India Today, citing forensic examination of voice samples. 
Bassi and his successor Alok Verma have, in the meantime, moved on from the city's police force.A senior special-cell officer, requesting anonymity, said, "We are trying to connect the lose ends and are in the process of filing a chargesheet." 
"I was always sure that truth will come out... and conspiracy against JNU will also revealed," he said. 
He went on to question if those who attacked him when he was brought to court would be booked and also asked if the BJP leaders who spoke against him would apologise.
