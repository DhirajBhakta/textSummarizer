Even as West Bengal is reeling under the recent spate of riots in Baduria and 24 North Paraganas, groups spearheading the Gorkhaland movement has criticised the West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee. 
Incidentally, both the chief minister and those working for the Gorkhaland cause have both targeted the NDA-led central government. 
While Mamata slammed the Centre for non-cooperation in the time of crisis, Gorkhaland Jan Mukti Morcha (GJM) criticised the centre's wait and watch policy.
