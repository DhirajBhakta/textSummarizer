From an American Diplomat to investment bankers, college students and young entrepreneurs; 24 cyclists will pedal more than 250 kms every day through five states to create awareness about human trafficking and child labour. 
With over 1.35 lakh children gone missing in 2015, this group will travel between India Gate and Gateway of India and visit houses on the way to tell people about the menace of child labour. 
The cycle expedition for the cause of spreading awareness will be interspersed with pit stops at Jaipur, Bhilwara, Kherwara, Vadodara and Telasari, said Rishikant of Shakti Vahini, an NGO working for child rights.
