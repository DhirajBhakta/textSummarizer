Prithvi Shaw's initiation into the Mumbai Ranji Trophy team, aged 17 completes the trio of Mumbai cricket's boy wonders' transition to higher grade cricket. 
Prithvi who first made news, aged 14, scoring a record individual score of 546 in the famed Harris Shield, made 191 runs from five matches as an opener in Asia Cup for India U-19. 
?The Mumbai selectors would hope Prithvi's transition from cricketing adolescence to adulthood is more fruitful than another boy wonder, Armaan Jaffer, they tried earlier in the season. 
Armaan whose schools' record of 498 runs was bettered by Prithvi, could only muster 44 runs in the six innings he played for Mumbai.Rege agrees bridging the gap between age group cricket to Ranji Trophy does not come easy.
