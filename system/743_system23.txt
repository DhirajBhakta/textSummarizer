To meet the increasing demand for parking space near Metro stations, the municipal corporations have decided to construct stack parking lots next to 10 busy stations across the city.Stations that have been identified for the project are Punjabi Bagh, Madipur, Udyog Nagar, Nangloi, Mundka, Pratap Nagar, Ghitorni, Okhla, Indraprastha Estate and Seelampur. 
Explaining the reasons for constructing multi-level car parking lots, north MCD additional commissioner Renu Jagdev, said: The plots near Metro stations are small in size and located along the main roads so we cant construct multi-level car parking facilities, she said.With the help of computers, information about the vacant slots would be easily accessible.
