Many cricket fans blamed the al-rounder for the eventual loss. 
"Honestly the true followers of the game understand that such things (run out) happen sometimes. 
No one does it intentionally," Ravindra Jadeja told India Today. 
?"Everyone wants to represents the country and everyone has big dreams. 
There have been so many run outs in cricket, but it is part of the game and I don't think I need to worry so much about it," he added. 
?India has played a lot of cricket since then. 
Up next a Sri Lanka who will be trying to bounce back after an humiliating loss to Zimbabwe in the ODI series.? ?"Critics change their views after every series.
