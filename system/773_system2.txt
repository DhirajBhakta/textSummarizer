Even as Assam reels under floods a Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) report revealed a shortfall of 60% in the release of central funds for the states flood management projects.The centre was supposed to release R. 2,043.19 crore between 2007-08 and 2015-16 for 141 projects but only released R. 812.22 crore. 
They found inordinate delays in almost a quarter of the projects, in release of funds and ultimately completion of projects ranging from 10 months to 13 years.In none of the 17 states were flood prone areas even assessed scientifically.
