A 22-year-old woman who posed as a cancer patient to con her Facebook friends into giving her Rs 22 lakh, has been arrested in Hyderabad. 
Samia Abdul Hafeez, a resident of the city's Saidabad area, started an online campaign in January, claiming she was suffering from brain and breast cancer and needed money for treatment. 
She had a Facebook page called 'Go Fund Samia.'
