After morale-breaking drubbing in Uttar Pradesh Assembly election, the question of who controls the Samajwadi Party might have become irrelevant for some time, but the bitterness between party founder father Mulayam Singh and SP president Akhilesh Yadav continues.Lok Sabha MP Mulayam Singh Yadav slammed Akhilesh Yadav for his revolt against the then party leadership and family ahead of Uttar Pradesh election.Mulayam Singh Yadav said, "One who betrayed his father, can't be a friend of others. 
After Mulayam Singh made his brother Shivpal Yadav the UP unit chief of the Samajwadi Party, Akhilesh revolted and sacked his uncle from the government.In what followed, two obvious camps were formed in the party with Akhilesh and Rajya Sabha MP Ram Gopal Yadav shooting down every move of the other side led by Mulayam Singh and Shivpal Yadav.At one point of time, Akhilesh Yadav and Ram Gopal Yadav were expelled by Mulayam-Shivpal camp. 
Akhilesh was elected as the Samajwadi Party president making it clear that the founder had lost control over his own political outfit.
