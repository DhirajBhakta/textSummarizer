Smartphones can now help you finish your math homework by giving step-by-step solutions to hard-to-crack algebra equations, thanks to a new artificial intelligence (AI) app developed by engineers including one of Indian origin. 
The app, created by US-based start up Socratic, allows students to learn how to answer a question just by snapping a photo of it. 
Every student takes math, often for multiple years, and it can be hard to get help from parents and friends," said Shreyans Bhansali, Head of Engineering at Socratic.
