In two other countries  Syria and Iraq  the death penalty is carried out by non-state actors, including Islamic State.The report notes that, although the potential exists for a death penalty to be handed down under sharia courts in at least five other countries  Pakistan, Afghanistan, the UAE, Qatar and Mauritania  there is no evidence suggesting that it has been implemented for consensual same-sex acts between adults in private.Same-sex relations  which are variously criminalised under laws covering sodomy, buggery and acts against nature among others  could lead to a prison sentence in 71 states in all.However, this number excludes Egypt, where same-sex relations are technically legal but are vigorously pursued and where hundreds of people are reported to be detained on morality grounds.Altogether, more than 120 countries have decriminalised homosexuality.
