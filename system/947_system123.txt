After a video by a local private FM channel poking fun at the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) went viral on social media, two Yuva Sena members on Tuesday urged the municipal commissioner to file a Rs500-crore defamation suit against 93.5 Red FM.The two leaders  Amey Ghole, who is also a corporator, and Samadhan Sarvankar, who is Sena legislator Sada Sarvankars son  said the radio channel and its radio host, Malishka, were unfairly blaming the BMC for problems that are not under its jurisdiction.
