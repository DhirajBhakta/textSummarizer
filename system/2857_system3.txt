The Lucknow bench of the Allahabad High Court had handed over the case to the CBI, saying there was a need to probe the alleged misappropriation and defalcation of public money during the implementation of the scheme. 
The Adityanath government seems to rely more on CBI than on Uttar Pradesh police," the SP spokesperson said. 
The state government also recommended a CBI probe into the alleged irregularities in the working of the Shia and Sunni waqf boards. 
The UP government is also contemplating to recommend a CBI probe into various anomalies in the Gomti Riverfront Development Project- a dream project of former Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav.
