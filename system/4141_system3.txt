Rex Tillerson has said he did not want to be US secretary of state and only took the job because his wife convinced him to do it.The former ExxonMobil oil executive revealed his initial reluctance in an interview published after a controversial trip to Asia and hours before the biggest event of his two months at the state department, an international meeting on Wednesday about how to fight Islamic State (Isis).  
In his interview, Tillerson repeated that explanation but also suggested it would be his policy to avoid the press until and unless he had a specific message to deliver.He told the IJR: Im not a big media press access person. 
I understand its important to get the message of what were doing out, but I also think theres only a purpose in getting the message out when theres something to be done.When questioned about Russia, the IJR reported: He was so cagey  his answer wasnt even worthy of inclusion.Tillerson has also been criticised for failing to defend the state department vocally enough in the face of a threatened budget cut of up to a third.
