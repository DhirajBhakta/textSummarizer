Remember yesteryear actor Mumtaz of Jai Jai Shiv Shankar fame? 
Well, a recent photo of hers is going viral on the internet and she looks absolutely unrecognisable. 
Mumtaz had bid adieu to showbiz decades ago and relocated to London. 
The picture appears to have been taken there itself.Mumtaz, who delivered several hits like Do Raaste, Chor Machaye Shor and Bandhan, was last seen in Bollywood in the 1990 film Aandhiyan. 
Aandhiyan was her comeback film after Aaina (1977). 
She had taken a break from her career to concentrate on her family.Mumtaz's elder daughter Natasha Madhwani is married to actor Fardeen Khan. 
Speculation is rife that Natasha and Fardeen are expecting their second child together. 
The couple already have a three-year-old daughter, Diani Isabella Khan, who was born on December 11, 2013.
