Our effort in this country and around the world, for the last several years has been to promote talent, skill development, whether in math or computer science or any related discipline at schools, colleges and also at an advanced level," Chandrasekaran told PTI. 
"We are working with a large number of schools to promote STEM. 
We are pursuing this in different parts of the world," the new chairman of Tata Sons said in response to a question. 
Before being appointed as Tata Sons chairman, Chandrasekaran headed TCS, in which capacity he was instrumental in USD 35 million grant to Carnegie Mellon University to research and promote "pioneering work in technologies so that we are able to create a better future, a better world for the humanity". 
The new centre will be ready by next year and it will help in promoting advanced research in all these technologies and more, he said.
