"If India agrees to lower its tariffs on Harley Davidson motorcycles, Indian consumers will buy more Harleys and save less while Harley will sell more Harleys and invest more," Peter Navarro, Director of White House National Trade Council, said in a letter to the editor to The Wall Street Journal. 
He had argued that if the US uses leverage as the worlds largest market to "persuade" India to reduce its "notoriously high tariffs" America will surely sell more Harleys there.
