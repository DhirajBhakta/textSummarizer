The opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) claimed on Monday that few Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) legislators cross-voted in favour of NDA candidate Ram Nath Kovind, which was a signal to the upheaval in the Arvind Kejriwal-led party. 
Soon after the voting started, BJP legislator OP Sharma claimed that at least 10-12 AAP legislators were likely to vote for the NDA candidate and it will become clear after the votes are counted on July 20.
