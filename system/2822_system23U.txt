Offering a solution to hapless parents who are unable to bring up their newborns, the women and child development (WCD) ministry will now keep cradles at government hospitals, orphanages and police stations across the country where one can leave their child behind for adoption. 
"By leaving their child behind in a cradle, parents will knowingly put their child up for adoption."
