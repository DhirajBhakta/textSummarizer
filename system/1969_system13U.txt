Travel by bus is all set to get cheaper as the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government in Delhi is offering discount of up to 75% in order to encourage more people use public transport and leave their personal vehicles at home. 
We are targeting youngsters and if they leave their bikes home and take the bus, then pollution will be reduced to a certain extent, said a senior transport department official.As per the data, 21.80% Delhi  commuters travel by bus but share of buses among all registered vehicles in Delhi has gone down from 1.52% in 1980-81 to 0.36% in 2014-15.
