The court observed, "It is possible that despite the vehicle being driven in permissible limit, an accident can occur when a jaywalker suddenly appears on the road.""
The fact that the victim chose to walk across a busy road near the airport, with heavy morning traffic, he knowingly exposed himself to dangers that such risk may entail. 
While noting that there was a fair chance of the accident being avoided if the vehicle was being driven at the permissible limit and maintaining fair distance with the vehicle moving ahead of it, the court said, " One has also to bear in mind that not all city roads are carefully marked for pedestrian or zebra crossing.""
The appellant could have well seen from some distance the movement of the pedestrian crossing the road," the court added.
