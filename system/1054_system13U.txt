Billed as a citadel of Maharashtra's Shiv Sena, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) might be on course to welcome the BJP as an equally powerful - if not more - stakeholder in its governance, exit polls showed.The Shiv Sena fielded candidates on all 227 BMC wards across the metropolis for Tuesday's elections. 
The Congress, the survey showed, could manage 16 percent, the NCP four and the MNS eight percent.In terms of wards, the exit poll forecast 86 to 92 seats for the Shiv Sena.
