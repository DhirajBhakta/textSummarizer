BhakyaSri was left under the care of the herbal treatment centre owner and relative Naveen Balalji by her parents on June 2 to attend a wedding function. 
According to testimony of BhakyaSri's neighbours, they saw the staff of the treatment centre drop off the freezer box on June 3. 
To add to their plight, the parents had to face blatant apathy at the Coimbatore General Hospital, where they were asked to pay Rs 3,000 as bribe to collect BhakyaSri's body from the morgue. 
BhakyaSri's relatives claim that Naveen Balaji who runs the herbal treatment centre in Erode is a fraud and has no authorisation from medical bodies or the government.
