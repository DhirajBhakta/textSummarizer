Driving alongside and deliberately driving into a driver and getting away scot-free pretty much - he still came away with fourth - I think that's a disgrace," Hamilton was quoted as saying by the Guardian."
I think he disgraced himself today, to be honest," he added.The three-time world champion, who finished one place back in fifth, said that if Vettel wants prove that he's a man, he should do it out of the car face to face."
If he wants to prove that he's a man, I think he should do it out of the car face to face. 
I think that says it all," he said.Meanwhile, Vettel, Hamilton's Formula One world championship rival, insisted that he had not been at fault although he got a 10-second stop-go penalty for dangerous driving."
If I get a penalty, then we should both get a penalty," he added.The 29-year-old said he had not intended to hit Hamilton when he drew alongside him"We had a little contact, but I drove alongside him mostly to raise my hand.
