New Delhi, Jan 10 (PTI)Foreign lender Citi India today launched voice biometrics authentication that would replace the current practice of interactive voice response (IVR) for its customers. 
The new technology allows clients to use their voiceprints for authentication rather than having to remember multiple PINs or respond to questions used for verifying their identities, Citi South Asia Head (Operations & Technology) Anand Chopra said. 
The voice biometrics authentication capability uses voiceprint, similar to fingerprint, which is unique for each person. 
"Voice biometrics authentication coupled with our already launched e-chat and virtual assistant feature, will transform the way we service the Citi customers in India. 
We anticipate a very high uptake for the use of voice biometrics authentication amongst our customers," Chopra said.
