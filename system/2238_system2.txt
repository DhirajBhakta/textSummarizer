Those who have cleared Class 12 from Maharashtra, even without Class 10 from the state, will be eligible for state quota seats from now, said Dr Pravin Shingare, director of DMER.Parents said the purpose of state quota seats was being defeated as most students from the state were losing out on seats in state-run and private institutes due to this change in eligibility criteria. 
Our children deserve seats in state institutes, said Ranjan Mehta, another parent.Parents were also unhappy with DMERs decision to not release a revised provisional state merit list, after verification of documents of all aspirants.
