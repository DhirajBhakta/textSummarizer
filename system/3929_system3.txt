Before rumours of Shraddha Kapoor's liaison with Farhan Akhtar, it was her alleged 'aashiqui' with Aditya Roy Kapur that was the talk of the town. 
Shraddha refuting the reports did not help much; the gossip mills kept churning out stories of her closeness with both her co-stars. 
Now, if a report in Deccan Chronicle is to be believed, Farhan got into an ugly spat with Aditya over his closeness with Shraddha.Reportedly, Shraddha and her onscreen 'jaanu' Aditya were bonding at the 30 years of Mahesh Bhatt's Vishesh Films celebration, which left Farhan fuming. 
A source is quoted as saying, "Farhan was pretty upset with Aditya and things took a wrong turn from there. 
As soon as Shraddha got a wind of it, she jumped in to control the damage. 
In fact, she is at Farhan's residence sorting out the issue as we speak."
Shraddha was clicked outside Farhan's house on Tuesday evening.According to the report, Aditya's car was also spotted few steps ahead of Farhan's residence.
