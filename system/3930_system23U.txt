The apex court dismissed Karnataka government's review petition to declare former chief minister of Tamil Nadu J Jayalalithaa a convict in the DA case.The Congress-led Karnataka government also wanted Rs 100 crore fine imposed by the trial court on Jayalalithaa to be recovered by selling her properties. 
?In its review petition to the Supreme Court, the Karnataka government had said that apex court's decision to abate proceedings against late Jayalalithaa was an "error apparent on the face of record".? In February, the Supreme Court had set aside the Karnataka High Court judgment of May 2015 which had acquitted Sasikala Natarajan and former Tamil Nadu chief minister Jayalalithaa.
