Its very important for me that the character I am playing must be of certain importance and different from my previous one.  
Meera (Cocktail) is shy and demure, while Happy was loud, outspoken and wears her heart on her sleeve, says Diana, adding that her next roles are different as well. 
And in Parmanu I will be doing little bit of action, something that I have never done before, she adds.
