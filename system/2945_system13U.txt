Rashid Latif has extended a hand of friendship towards Virender Sehwag after his tirade on social media created a storm in India. 
While Sehwag had chosen to maintain a dignified silence, India cricketer Manoj Tiwary posted a video with a like-for-like response to Latif. 
India had defeated Pakistan in their Champions Trophy opener on June 4 and there was the usual social media banter between supporters of the two teams.
