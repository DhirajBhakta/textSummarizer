Bollywood editor and writer Apurva Asrani, best known for his films with Hansal Mehta (Aligarh, Shahid),  has written a poem on the mob culture. 
India has recently witnessed a host of public lynchings.Asrani wrote the poem on his Facebook wall last week and it is being shared across the platform ever since. 
And if it endures, persists and kicks back, Of a new hashtag it may be found able.The stray thought will then be co-opted,A following of its own it will make.And when it starts to believe its own legend,fast fingers will claw at its facade.After all, we are the mob and the mob is us.Apurva was recently in news when he got into a row with Kangana Ranaut over the writing credits of Hansal Mehta?
