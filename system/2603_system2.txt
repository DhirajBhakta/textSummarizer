The communications regulator is hunting a radio pirate who has repeatedly hijacked the airwaves of a local station with a deliberately offensive song about masturbation.The Winkers Song, a 1970s ditty by an artist going by the name Ivor Biggun, has been illegally forced on to the output of Mansfield 103.2 at least eight times in the last month.Ofcom said it was taking the incident extremely seriously and its engineers were working closely with the radio station to trace and identify the pirate.Listeners were last subjected to the song, which uses the word wanker 36 times, this weekend during a live family broadcast from Mansfields Party in the Market event.It is believed the rogue broadcaster could be using a small transmitter to play the adult theme on the same frequency, overriding the stations scheduled programming.
