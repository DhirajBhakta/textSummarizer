Unless an institute is established by an act enacted in Parliament or as a university, it cannot grant degrees.The Indian Institute of Management Bill, 2017, alters the top-rated business schools status, which will enable the institute to award degrees such as MBA and PhD, instead of PGDM and fellowships.Human resource development minister Prakash Javadekar said the aim is to remove government interference in IIMs. 
The comptroller and auditor general will check IIM account books since these run on taxpayers money, he added.Also, he said: There is no provision of giving names to IIMs.
