Verma, and most other residents of the village, say while the WiFi facility may have waited, the government should have first ensured regular water supply, an approach road and improved connectivity.Kadipur was declared a free Wi-Fi village on June 19 by the local councillor Urmila Rana. 
Villagers access the facility by registering their phone numbers on which they get security code to log in.Delhi BJP chief and Northeast Delhi MP Manoj Tiwari had adopted Kadipur village under the Sansad Adarsh Gram Yojna in 2014.A month after the WiFi facility was launched, Hindustan Times visited the village and found that while the internet facility was working fine, most villagers were disappointed with the civic infrastructure.We get only two hours of water supply that too every alternate day.
