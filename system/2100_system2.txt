The Delhi Durbar on December 12, 1911 was marked as a celebration of the coronation of King Emperor George V. 
But the king's proclamation at the durbar, kept a secret till then, changed Delhi's fate and put it firmly on the international political map.Calcutta, the nerve centre of British Raj till then, had fallen out of favour as it had become politically volatile. 
The British government wanted to shift the capital and Delhi won on many counts. 
The capital, however, would keep growing beyond the garden city planned by Edwin Lutyens - and continues to grow.
