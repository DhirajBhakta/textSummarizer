The Indian Railways would announce the facility this week. 
Aiming to attract more foreigners and NRI travellers, railways have undertaken steps to facilitate easy booking of tickets for them. 
Foreigners are also not allowed to book tickets in Suvidha trains that cater to last minute travel planners. 
The aim is to provide adequate time to foreigners and NRIs to plan their holidays well in advance, said a senior Railway Ministry official. 
They are required to give visa details, passport and international mobile numbers while booking online through the IRCTC ticketing site.
