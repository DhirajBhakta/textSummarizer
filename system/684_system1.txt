New Delhi, Jul 23 (PTI) At least 26 chartered accountants have come under the scanner of the ICAI for allegedly helping shell companies, a senior official said. 
The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) is the regulator for accountancy professionals and can initiate disciplinary action against erring members. 
"The role of (around) 26 chartered accountants with respect to their alleged links with shell companies are being looked into by the institute," ICAI President Nilesh Shivji Vikamsey told PTI. 
As the government continues its clamp down on shell companies in efforts to deal with the black money menace, many entities have come under the lens of various agencies, including the Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO).
