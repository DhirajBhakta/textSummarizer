The railway ministry plans to introduce its ambitious integrated ticketing system in the next three years and Mumbai will be the first city to experience it. 
The project will be executed in two stages: in the first, the software will be integrated with the existing ticketing system and in the second, entry and exit gates will be installed at stations. 
MRVC will present the railways perspective to the MMRDA, which is the primary organisation for the integrated ticketing system, said Prabhat Sahai, chairman and MD, MRVC.Sources said chief minister Devendra Fadnavis is keen on the project.
