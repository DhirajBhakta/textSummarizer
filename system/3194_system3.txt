Sony TV is in a crisis of sorts after its flagship show The Kapil Sharma Show witnessed a huge drop in TRPs, after four of its cast members quit following a mid-air tiff with host Kapil. 
Within a few months, the ratings more than halved.This week, however, was comparatively good for this once-popular show, as it registered an increase of 1 million impressions, according to BARC India's latest data. 
The show got 4.1 million impressions for the week--May 13-19.
