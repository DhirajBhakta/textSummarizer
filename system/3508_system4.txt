As many as 500-600 employees have been impacted by the lay offs in sales and other related functions, two people familiar with the matter said. 
The lay-offs are across locations, they said, adding that the severance package being offered to the employees impacted by the decision is one months salary for every year of service. 
Sources in the company said that these are challenging times for the telecom industry. 
The lay-offs comes at a time when the telecom industry has been witnessing an intense tariff war triggered by the entry of Reliance Jio, whose disruptive positioning in the market has left most of the telcos bleeding.
