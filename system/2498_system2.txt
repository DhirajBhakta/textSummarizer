In a drill conducted in April, CISF officials failed in the security drill. 
In some cases, we have even suspended the staff, a CISF official said.For better concentration, the CISF personnel also rotate baggage screener every hour.We have an in-built software through which we throw random images of bomb, knives and other prohibited items and if our staff fail to detect it, we take action against them.
