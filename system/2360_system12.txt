Some 14,000 people signed a petition to stop the move.Sad times, @NHM_London will not be the same without Dippy #SaveDippy https://t.co/DhY2TWAlLD Jordan Bhatt (@Jordan_Bhatt) July 13, 2017But the museum said the skeleton of the blue whale, the largest animal to have lived on Earth  which has been hunted to near extinction  would better raise awareness of mankinds impact on nature.The 25.2-metre (83-foot) real skeleton suspended from the ceiling is a powerful reminder of the fragility of life and the responsibility we have towards our planet, museum director Michael Dixon said.The whale was previously in the mammals section but was not fully in view and will now take centre stage in the diving lunge feeding position in Hintze Hall, a cathedral-like space built in the late 19th century.Fans of Dippy need not despair as the replica will in any case be preserved for posterity in a bronze cast to be placed outside the museum.Prince Williams wife Kate, the Duchess of Cambridge, attended a gala launch reception for Hope on July 13 along with famous British conservationist David Attenborough.Kate Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge (in white), and David Attenborough (in blue) are shown the blue whale skeleton by museum director Sir Michael Dixon during the reopening of Hintze Hall at the Natural History Museum in London on July 13, 2017.
