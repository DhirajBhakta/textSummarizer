I wouldnt have had success with films such as Grand Masti, Krrish 3 or Prince. 
For me, a simplistic way of looking at life was that if my phone still rings and the other person says that I have a role for you in my film I am successful, he says.The actor, who has experimented with various genres and roles, does not believe in categorising his work.
