The commission issued a circular on Wednesday, asking all the higher educational institutes to take steps to prevent ragging and warned them of punitive action if they failed to take action against those found guilty. 
Universities have been asked to step up anti-ragging mechanisms by constituting an anti-ragging committee, anti-ragging squad, setting up anti-ragging cell and installing CCTVs. 
Some of the measures also include identification of troublemakers and surprise checks in hostels, student accommodations, canteens, recreational rooms, toilets and bus stops.
