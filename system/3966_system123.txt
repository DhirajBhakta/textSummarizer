A visit to The Wine Company at DLF Cyber Hub, Gurgaon, turned foul for three young men, who now claim they were brutally thrashed by the bouncers here for no good reason.Suryansh Jalan wrote a review on Zomato saying that three of his friends had gone to The Wine Company on Monday night at around 10pm. 
Jalan wrote that, at this point, the restaurant's manager was summoned, after which "a heated, yet cordial argument" ensued between the two parties.Ultimately, the manager accepted the restaurant's error, gave them a corrected bill, which Jalan said his friends paid and headed for the door "as can be clearly viewed on the CCTV footage."
