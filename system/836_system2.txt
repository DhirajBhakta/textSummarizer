Bhiku Daji Bhilare, who was claimed to have saved Mahatma Gandhi from being killed by Nathuram Godse in 1944, passed away today after a brief illness.The 98-year-old Gandhian, popularly known as Bhilare Guruji, was cremated at his village, Bhilar, in Mahabaleshwar Teshil in western Maharashtras Satara district, family sources said.Bhilare, born on November 28, 1919, is survived by three sons.While there is no documented history about Bhilare having foiled Godses earlier attack, the great grandson of Mahatma Gandhi, Tushar Gandhi, in his new book has dwelled on how fundamentalists had planned and made many attempts on the life of the Father of the Nation before he was finally killed.According to him, there were four attempts on the Mahatmas life, before Godse killed him in 1948.The attack at Panchgani in 1944, where Bhilare Guruji overpowered Nathuram, was the second of these attempts, he has claimed in the book.
