Airlines have no authority to impose flying ban on anybody, including parliamentarians, and the law of the land should take its course, Rajya Sabha deputy chairman PJ Kurien said on Thursday.The remarks came after SP member Naresh Agrawal raised the issue of recent flying ban imposed by major domestic airlines, including state-owned Air India.Agrawal wanted to know if the airlines could impose such restrictions. 
I think the government should take note of it.MPs are also citizens ... if they commit a crime or mistake, the law of the land should take recourse to it, the deputy chairman said.He further said it is a punishment imposed on an MP for some crime...This cannot be done. 
This is not a thing to be punished by airlines.Congress MP Anand Sharma suggested to the deputy chairman that the word crime should be replaced with violation.However, Kurien said if a person beats up someone, it is a crime.Different airlines on Wednesday lifted the flying ban on TDP lawmaker JC Diwakar Reddy after urgent notices from the court to the government and the aviation regulator DGCA on the lawmakers plea against the action of domestic carriers.On June 15, Reddy got into a verbal spat with IndiGo ground staff at Visakhapatnam airport and threw a printer kept at the airline counter after he was informed that boarding for his flight to Hyderabad had closed.Reddy was the second MP after Shiv Senas Ravindra Gaikwad who was banned from flying domestic airlines.
