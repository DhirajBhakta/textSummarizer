last week, but police soon came looking for Gupta, who earns Rs 2,500 per month as a Shiksha Mitra (a system under which teachers are hired on contract). 
Now, Gupta, his wife, and his cousin are behind bars for the theft from a shop in Bilaspur district, about 115km north of state capital Raipur.?
He told us he stole the sarees because he wanted his wife to shine among other women in their community pageant,? 
Gupta admitted he could not afford the sarees, but did not want his wife to feel inferior among other women of the community. 
Police zeroed in on Gupta and his wife and recovered the stolen sarees.
