I don't know, but it has become like a process where every film needs to go through and I think you should watch the film with reference to the context. 
The censor board asked Madhur Bhandarkar, the director of Indu Sarkar, to remove words like RSS and Akali from the film. 
After Pink, I wanted to do something with which people will get surprised again so Indu Sarkar seemed as the perfect fit as it has Emergency as its backdrop. 
The title role that I played was very challenging and interesting," Kirti said.Controversies over Indu Sarkar have ranged from reactions against the CBFC, backlash against Bhandarkar after a Congress representative announced prize money for any person who can blacken the filmmaker's face, to politicians demanding exclusive screenings of the film ahead of censor certification for approvals.About the row, Kirti said: "I will be lying if I say that it (controversies surrounding Indu Sarkar') doesn't bother me. 
But now daily something or the other is happening, especially I am most concerned about the censor board because if we do what they have asked for, then the whole essence of the film goes."
