The railways today spelt out a target of Rs 40,000 crore revenue from monetising its soft assets in the next 10 years. 
In a two-pronged strategy, the railways aims to increase earnings through traditional as well as non-traditional sources, while at the same time reducing expenditure. 
"Earlier the railways used to focus on traditional sources for revenue earnings, that is passenger fares and freight. 
Railways has formulated the non-fare revenue (NFR) policy to perk up earnings from advertisements on trains, putting up large LCD screens on its premises and monetising data. 
Noting that railways witnesses more than eight billion footfalls and eyeballs in a year, Prabhu said, "If we can monetise it, the railways can capture the immense value from it." 
In order to increase its freight earnings, railways has diversified its freight basket from 10 major commodities to about 40 goods.
