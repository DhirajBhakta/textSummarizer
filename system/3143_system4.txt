According to a report in DNA, Aamir has apparently asked for the lion's share of the profits of the Vijay Krishna Acharya-directed a film.A trade insider is quoted as saying, "Aamir will pocket almost 70 per cent of the profits while Adi will keep the remaining percentage. 
If TOH makes that amount of money, Adi (Aditya Chopra) will get almost Rs 300 crore which is much more than any of his own home productions."
Aamir is also said to be getting a 33 per cent share of the film's royalty, which includes satellite rights and other money that the film might earn in the future.Thugs of Hindostan will feature Amitabh Bachchan, Katrina Kaif and Fatima Sana Shaikh in leading roles, apart from Aamir.
