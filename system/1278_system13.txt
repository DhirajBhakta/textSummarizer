Defending his decision to ban Rs 500 and Rs 1000 currency notes, Prime Minister Narendra Modi today said the best time to launch demonetisation is when the economy is in good shape.
"Demonetisation in a booming economy is like shooting at the tyres of a racing car," he had said.On November 8 last year, Modi, in a televised address, announced the banning of high currency notes - a decision he said was aimed at checking black money and terror funding.
