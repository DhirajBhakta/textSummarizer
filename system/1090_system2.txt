It is the offices of agrifood company FasoPro, which double as a caterpillar laboratory.Kahitouo Hien walks hastily from one room to another, his T-shirt bearing an unusual slogan: Small caterpillars, big pleasure.Caterpillars are made up of more than 60% protein, says Hien. 
They are among the most nutritious foods available in Burkina Faso.According to the World Food Programme, acute malnutrition in Burkina Faso stands at 10.4%.Poor harvests, caused by drought, mean there is a lack of food and diverse nutrients in the country. 
For several months, his team has been working on ways to breed caterpillars in a controlled environment, rather than in nature.Once mature, caterpillars normally hide in the ground to grow  a stage that is only possible in porous soil, Hien explains.
