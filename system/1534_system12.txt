The girl was rescued by the West Bengal Police from brothel number 56, which is owned by a couple lodged in Tihar jail. 
Instead of just arresting the traffickers, the police must break the nexus, said Rishi Kant of the Shakti Vahini NGO, who assisted the West Bengal Police in the operation.The crime branch admitted that girls are sold to the brothel owners for Rs 1 lakh and the victims are confined in hidden cells, thrashed, intoxicated, starved and forced into commercial activity.While the victims are compelled to live in terrible conditions, their distressed family members keep running from pillar to post to trace them.
