Hearing a petition filed by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), the top court said it was ready for day-to-day hearing in the case after the central investigation agency pleaded the court that conspiracy charges against top BJP leaders, including Advani, Joshi, Union Minister Uma Bharti be revived. 
Senior advocate K K Venugopal, appearing for the BJP leaders, told the Supreme Court that his clients were ready to face conspiracy charges if the CBI can adduce evidence against them in Raebareli.
