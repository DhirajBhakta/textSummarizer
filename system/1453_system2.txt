The songs that will be played will give them more space to accept the training part and will make them more receptive and inclined towards the lessons being imparted, the officer said.A proposal has been mooted in this regard and soon a tender will be floated for procurement of music systems and related components, said the officer.It is felt that the addition of songs, although played only in audio format, will help the traffic offenders imbibe lessons of road safety properly, officials claimed.
