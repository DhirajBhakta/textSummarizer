But I had mixed relays helping me out, so its a bit different.Yet no less impressive.Dressel led off the mixed free relay with a blistering time of 47.22 for the first 100  even more remarkable given what hed already been through  and his three teammates  Nathan Adrian, Mallory Comerford and Simone Manuel  took it from there.That last relay was a lot of fun, Dressel said.
