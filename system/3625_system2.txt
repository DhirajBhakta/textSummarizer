AIADMK REVOLT Dinakaran's arrest comes at a time when there are moves to merge the two factions of the AIADMK - the AIADMK Puratchi Thalaivi Amma led by former Chief Minister O Panneerselvam, and the AIADMK Amma, led by incumbent CM Edappadi Palaniswami (and to which Dinakaran, too, belongs).Dinakaran was in February appointed the AIADMK's deputy general secretary by jailed party chief V S Sasikala - who happens to be his aunt.
