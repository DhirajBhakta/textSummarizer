Amitabh Bachchan-Shashi Kapoor, Amitabh Bachchan-Rishi Kapoor, Akshay Kumar-Suniel Shetty, Sanjay Dutt-Govinda, among others, are some of the most well-known pairs of heroes that have consistently produced great entertainers.Today, it will be difficult to get Ranbir Kapoor, Ranveer Singh, Shahid Kapoor, etc to star together in a film. 
Films like Rangoon (Shahid-Saif), Padmavati (Shahid-Ranveer) and Gunday (Ranveer-Arjun) are some recent exceptions.But till now, we have not seen two big contemporary stars at the prime of their careers, coming together to do a film. 
Expecting to see them together in a project is not that difficult.When asked about doing a two-hero film, Akshay Kumar said, "I am open to doing a two-hero film. 
If there are more actors, I will have to do less work to do in the film, so it's good for me in a way."
I would love to do a film with another actor friend.
