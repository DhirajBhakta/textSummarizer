Now, people are holding their breath on the completion of the tunnel while ensuring that the Great Wall is not damaged in the process, the Global Times reported.Luo Duhao, chief engineer of the Beijing-Zhangjiakou High-Speed Railway Line, being built by China Railway Number 5 Engineering Group Co said the firm will employ precision micro-blasting technology, which has a velocity of 0.2 cm per second and is able to make the tremor weaker than the traditional firepower blasts that have a velocity of 5 cm per second.Luo told the Global Times that the new technology will ensure that the Great Wall will not be affected by the blasts, as they will be barely felt.The new technology causes little damage to the geological environment, which will help protect the Great Wall, Dai Longzhen, deputy manager of the Beijing-Zhangjiakou High-Speed Railway Line, told the Global Times.I myself once stood on the Great Wall and I could not feel the blast at all, Dai added.Zhang Xuehua, a blast expert at the construction site, told the Peoples Daily that the construction of the tunnel has completed 4,500 blasts since early February this year.In the middle of the tunnel, workers will build a spacious and well-decorated station right under the Great Wall, with a record-breaking construction space of 36,000 square metres, the Xinhua News Agency reported.The station will be 102 metres below the surface of the Badaling Great Wall.Dai said the construction area and the depth of the station is record-breaking.He said that because the station is built underground, it will cause less damage to the plantation, and it also demonstrates Chinas top-notch railway construction capabilities.Originating from the Beijing Railway Station North, the Beijing-Zhangjiakou High-Speed Railway Line runs through Haidian, Changping and Yanqing districts of Beijing.
