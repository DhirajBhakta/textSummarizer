When he tried to rape me on Friday night, I chopped off his sexual organ," the survivor told the police.Since the girl was still a minor seven years back, when she claims the sexual assault started, the police registered a criminal case against the sanyasi under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POSCO).The girl's family, upon finding their sanyasi in a bloodied state, rushed him to the Thiruvananthapuram Medical College, where he was declared to be in a "critical condition".Police told India Today that they have not registered a case against the girl as she acted in self defense.
