The US energy secretary Rick Perry has become the latest victim of a pair of Russian phone pranksters who have previously fooled Elton John into thinking he was chatting to Vladimir Putin.On this occasion, Perry believed he was discussing American coal exports with Ukraines prime minister, Volodymyr Groysman. 
During the call on 19 July, Perry, whose department oversees the US nuclear weapons program, discussed a range of topics, including sanctions against Russia and helping Ukraine develop oil and gas.He also said the Trump administration opposes Nord Stream 2, a Russian project to bring natural gas to Europe across the Baltic, and that US technology could help Ukraine develop gas. 
It is unclear how the United States would bring more coal to Ukraine but Perry hinted on the call that the commerce department was working on it. 
The coal conversation at this particular point in time is with [secretary of commerce Wilbur Ross] and I full well suspect it will go forward, he said on the call.Reuters contributed to this report.
