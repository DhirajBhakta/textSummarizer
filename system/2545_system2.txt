This was said as part of Taapsees anecdote about her first film, but this got angry fan reactions like ungrateful, a hypocrite and a backstabber for supposedly forgetting her roots and taking a dig at such a veteran.Talking to Hindustan Times, Taapsee says, Er, what did I take a dig at Hes known for that. 
If people are just going to sit there and wait [for a chance] to get hurt, so they can start throwing shit around at other people, you can never stop them.Taapsee, who is doing a Telugu film (titled Anando Brahma) after several years, adds that as soon as the negative reactions surfaced, she made it a point to clear the air with K. 
The only person I was concerned about was my director and his family, and I got [a] good response from them  they told me that they all sat together and saw the video, and laughed at it, and I guess thats all that matters, she says.She might have more to say on this subject, but Taapsee is biding her time. 
Until now, I havent really gone out and commented on it, and theres a reason Im waiting for the point [when] everyone will hear what I have to say, rather than me saying the same thing ten times to ten different people, the actor says.
