The foundation, founded by spiritual leader Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, which has been in the centre of controversy, had roped in at least 15 experts to prepare a scientific report. 
The NGT panel had used satellite images and ground reports while claiming that large tracts of wetlands and water bodies were filled up for the event. 
One of the most glaring mistakes made in the report is the declaration of dry farmlands as huge tract of wetlands filled with water and several water bodies etc. 
Even the agricultural crops have been considered as wetland vegetation with shallow to deep water beneath them, the NGOs report has claimed. 
The experts pointed out that even the Survey of Indias report and National Wetland Atlas prepared by Space Application Centre have no mention of any such wetlands. 
The foundations report has also challenged the NGT-panels allegations that nearly 420 acres of Yamuna floodplains were damaged.
