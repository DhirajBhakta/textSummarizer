Diana was so unhappy in the few weeks after her fairy tale wedding with Prince Charles that she tried to slash her wrists, according to the transcripts of secret tapes of the popular princess. 
"I was so depressed, and I was trying to cut my wrists with razor blades," The Princess of Wales is quoted as saying. 
On her honeymoon she reveals she suffered "appalling dreams", adding: At night, I dreamt of Camilla the whole time.
