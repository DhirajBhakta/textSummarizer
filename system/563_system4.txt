Over the weekend I had the honour and the privilege to visit #Drass where the actual battle of #Kargil took place. 
Every Indian worth his or her salt must go and visit the biggest war memorial in our country. 
Just to stand there and hear Havildar Kuber Singh and see for themselves the terrain and the sacrifice of our boys standing there defending our borders so that we can pursue our lives in security. 
Many must have already visited the place and I think a lot more people should go there to get an idea of the never ending sacrifice of our soldiers.
