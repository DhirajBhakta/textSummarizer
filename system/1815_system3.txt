From K J M Varma ? Beijing, Dec 30 (PTI) A 64-year-old woman in China is believed to have become the oldest mother in the country to give birth to a baby. 
The woman and her husband declined to be interviewed, but people close to the family said the couple decided to have the baby after losing their first child, state-run China Daily reported. 
"Were keeping a close eye on the mother because women of this age can encounter cardiac failure and uncontrollable bleeding during or after a C-section, which are very dangerous," Teng said. 
Although there is no official data, including who is the oldest, anecdotal evidence suggests most of the older women had another baby after they lost their first child. 
Teng said she had a patient who gave birth two years ago at age 53 after losing a child, while in July, a 61-year-old gave birth after her only daughter died of disease at 30.
