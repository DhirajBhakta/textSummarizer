Last month, Shah Rukh Khan attended the TED 2017 conference in Vancouver, Canada and gave a fantastic speech that was tweeted about and written about by whoever was lucky enough to witness SRK speak.Yesterday, the entire filmed episode of Shah Rukh Khan's speech was uploaded on the TED website and within minutes, the video got viral. 
And for good reason.Shah Rukh Khan began by saying that he sells dreams and peddles love to millions of Indians who assume that he is the world's best lover."
