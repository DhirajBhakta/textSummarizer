Chandni Chowk MLA Alka Lamba has alleged that BJP leaders are calling Aam Aadmi Party legislators and luring them to switch sides by offering ticket in the Lok Sabha elections or coveted government posts.In a series of tweets, the AAP legislator claimed that she, too, received a call from a BJP leader. 
Speaking at a press conference at party office, AAP (Delhi) convener Dilip Pandey said party legislator from Jangpura, Praveen Deshmukh, has also been approached by the BJP leaders. 
On the question of AAP leaders being lured by offering money, I would say this has been the culture of AAP and Congress.
