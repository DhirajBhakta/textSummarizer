The name WWE Battleground is very fitting, because...it will be you and me locked in a Punjabi Prison match," he said.Up until now, there have been two Punjabi Prison matches in the history of the WWE and was introduced by The Great Khali. 
The Punjabi Prison match, very much like a steel cage match at Hell in a Cell or Elimination Chamber, is where two or more Superstars are locked inside to battle it out for supremacy without outside intervention.The difference being that there is a cage made of bamboo which is again surrounded by another octagonal bamboo structure while being? topped with a series of razor-sharp bamboo spikes.You have to escape not one, but TWO dangerous structures in a #PunjabiPrison match!
