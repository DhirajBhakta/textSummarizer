SHIV SENA THREATENS TO CREATE RUCKUSShiv Sena MP Anand Adsul, while speaking in the Zero Hour on Wednesday, said that no one was listening to his party. 
"Just because we are in the government does not imply we cannot create ruckus", he threatened.? ?Adsul will move an adjournment motion in the Lok Sabha on April 6 on the issue of blacklisting of Gaikwad by airlines and the government's alleged failure to take action against them. 
If sources are to be believed, Shiv Sena is going to raise this issue prominently once Gaikwad reaches Parliament. 
This has prompted the Sena to resort to an aggressive and unruly show of strength, and Parliament is likely to witness uproarious scenes over the issue on Thursday.Also read | Slippergate: Shiv Sena to protest in Parliament if MP Ravindra Gaikwad's flying ban is not liftedAlso read | Grounded MP Gaikwad tweaked name 4 times to book Air India tickets
