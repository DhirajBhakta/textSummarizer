Kadipur, a small village in northwest Delhi, has free WiFi facility with 25 servers providing 24-hour internet connectivity. 
Saurav Verma, 18, a student of Delhi University and resident of Kadipur village, has to wake up at 5 in the morning every alternate day, and wait an hour till the water tank is filled up. 
Verma said.It takes Verma at least two hours to reach Delhi University (North Campus) as connectivity to different parts of the city from the village is poor. 
He said improved connectivity will create better employment opportunities for the village youth, he said.Area councillor Urmila Rana said she has written to the Delhi government several times for improving the water supply but nothing has happened. ?
