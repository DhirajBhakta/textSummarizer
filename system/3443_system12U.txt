Amidst reports that Pakistani and Saudi Arabian channels are being shown on TV channels in Jammu and Kashmir, the Centre today asked the state government to take immediate steps to stop unauthorised broadcast.Information and Broadcasting Minister M Venkaiah Naidu expressed concern over reports that these channels are being broadcast in Jammu and Kashmir without permission and spoke with the state chief secretary on the issue.He also sought a compliance report at the earliest, official sources said.There have reports that over 50 Saudi and Pakistani channels besides Zakir Naik's banned Peace TV and others indulging in "anti-India" propaganda were allegedly running without necessary clearances via private cable networks in Kashmir.Earlier in the day, Naidu's deputy in the ministry, Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore, had said the local administration in the state has right to confiscate the equipment of cable operators allegedly airing unauthorised channels.Noting that the government has sent an advisory to the state, Rathore said such communications are regularly sent by the Centre on unauthorised channels."
