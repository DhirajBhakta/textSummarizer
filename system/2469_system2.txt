The website of the municipal committee in Uttar Pradesh?
The hacking was first noticed by municipal officials while uploading new tenders.?
The message was being flashed each time we visited the website and unlike floating advertisements, it was blocking the entire homepage,? 
said Ashwini Tripathi, an IT specialist who handles the website.According to Tripathi, the website was developed two years ago by a Noida-based company which was informed about the messages. ?
The website lacked security features and was easily hacked into. 
We have cleared the glitch and advised the municipal committee to buy additional security features for the website,? 
The officials of the municipal committee decided not to register a police complaint regarding the matter.Police officials said they were not aware of the hacking. ?
