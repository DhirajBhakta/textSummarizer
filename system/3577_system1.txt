India's top cueist Pankaj Advani lost to China's Lv Haotian in the summit clash of Asian Snooker Championship here today, as he failed in his bid to win the continental double of billiards and snooker titles in the same year.Advani lost 3-6 in the final to his Chinese opponent and it meant that he could not become the first player to win both Asian titles in Billiards and Snooker in same calendar year.The defeat in the final also meant that Advani could not complete a career Grand Slam in cue sport.Having won all the major events -- Nationals, Asian and World Championships in both Billiards and Snooker and in both the long and short formats, this is the one title (15-red Asian Snooker) that has eluded Advani.A victory will make Advani only player in history to win all Majors in two sports at all levels and across all formats.The Chinese player took the first frame before Advani drew parity.
