The European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, has given this statement:It was with great sadness and profound shock that I learnt of the brutal attack that struck Manchester.It breaks my heart to think that, once again, terrorism has sought to instil fear where there should be joy, to sow division where young people and families should be coming together in celebration.I would like to convey my deepest sympathies to Prime Minister May and to the British people.Today we mourn with you.
