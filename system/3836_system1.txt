This includes deployment of Border Security Force (BSF), construction of border fence and border roads, installation of floodlights and construction of border outposts (BOPs), introduction of hi-tech surveillance equipment and providing weapons and specialised vehicles to security forces.In another statement, MHA informed Parliament that approximately 250 km of India-Pakistan border has not been covered under fencing primarily due to riverines, ditches and marshy terrain, and in some cases due to pending land acquisition.The MHA said India has sanctioned a pilot project for deployment of technological solutions and force multipliers, physical patrolling, laying of concertina wires, laser infra-red system, among several other measures along the border.
