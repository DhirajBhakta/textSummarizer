It all began when a picture of a man checking out Disha's cleavage during the awards show went viral. 
But she gave it back to her haters with an epic response, and said that she is "not going to be anybody's idea of an Indian girl." 
She added, "It's easier to judge a woman on the basis of how much they cover up their skin, but it's hard to accept your own cheap mentality where you can't stop staring at those inappropriate areas which you are asking her to cover!"
thanks to my fan clubs friends and family for always giving me the strength i hope we all can find this strength from within each other and stop suffering ????
