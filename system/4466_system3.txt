The partys Delhi in-charge Sanjay Jha announced it an event where few district-level Aam Aadmi Party workers, mainly from east Delhi, joined JD(U), accusing the AAP of neglecting Poorvanchalis in MCD ticket distribution. 
He said the Poorvanchalis here have been "let down" by the Arvind Kejriwal government despite having extended every possible backing to it over the last two years. 
The Delhi unit of JD(U) was constituted during Kumars visit here on December 3 last year.
