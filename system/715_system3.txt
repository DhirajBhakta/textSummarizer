Or an acronym.So though Atletico Madrid wont partner anymore, the Kolkata franchise of the Indian Super League (ISL) will continue to be known as ATK, said its principal owner Sanjiv Goenka.And would ATK continue to stand for what is was over the past three years The name of the team is the name of the team and it is ATK. 
Translated from Bengali, that would mean the team for every Kolkatan.Speaking after the media conference where Goenka said this, a team official said it is premature to say that henceforth ATK would stand for something apart from what was coined three years ago after the La Liga giants came on board with a 25% stake in the ownership.ATM (Atletico de Madrid) will sell their stake to me, said Goenka. 
We have not let our fans down in the last three years, said Goenka.Babes compared to Bagan, EBGoenka said even though the I-League and the ISL would be held simultaneously this season, there is no competition between ATK and Mohun Bagan and East Bengal in terms of garnering support.
