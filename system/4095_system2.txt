The Jammu and Kashmir government has decided to say goodbye to the practice of asking government teachers to be part of election duties. 
While announcing this, Education Minister Altaf Bukhari said, "We want to provide teachers a congenial atmosphere and minimize disruption of academic activities. 
The state of Jammu and Kashmir has taken a lead in this direction. 
"Exempting us from all non-academic assignments including election duties to help them focus on their prime task of teaching is a great step.
