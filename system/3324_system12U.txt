Koirala in an interview to Mid-Day opened up on signing the film and playing Nargis Dutt on screen. 
She told the daily, "When casting agent Mukesh Chabbra called me for it, my first reaction was, 'What I have to play Baba's (Sanjay Dutt) mother now' We have done several films (Yalgaar, 1991; Sanam, 1997; Kartoos, 1999). 
I had my reservations as I would end up playing mother's roles.
