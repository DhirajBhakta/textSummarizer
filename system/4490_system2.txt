Modi ji, you very rightly said that you indeed work like a donkey," he tweeted.His dig at the Prime Minister came a day after Modi said he takes inspiration from the "loyal" and "hard working" animal and was amused that UP Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav was "afraid" of Gujarat's donkeys.Modi said the criticism of donkeys by Akhilesh only reflected his "casteist mentality" and "the feeling of hatred does not suit him"."
Modi had said, addressing an election rally in poll-bound UP.Modi had said,"The people of this country are my masters, I take inspiration from the donkey because I work for people day and night...donkeys are loyal to their master."
Addressing a poll rally in Rae Bareli three days ago, Akhilesh Yadav had said, "There comes an advertisement on Television that features donkeys. 
I will ask the megastar of this century (Amitabh Bachchan) to stop campaigning for donkeys."
