Houston, Dec 20 (PTI) Scientists have developed the first vaccine for chikungunya fever made from an insect-specific virus that does not have any effect on people, making it safe and effective. 
"This vaccine offers efficient, safe and affordable protection against chikungunya and builds the foundation for using viruses that only infect insects to develop vaccines against other insect-borne diseases," said Scott Weaver, professor at The University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston (UTMB) in the US.
