The Supreme Court today stayed the government's order to make Aadhaar card mandatory for PAN holders and said it can't be made mandatory for filing Income Tax returns. 
However, the apex court added that those who have Aadhaar must provide its details while filing Income Tax returns. 
The top court was hearing a batch of petitions challenging the constitutional validity of a provision in the Income Tax Act making Aadhaar mandatory for filing income tax returns and allotment of PAN."
