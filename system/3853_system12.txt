leaders From K J M Varma Beijing, Apr 11 (PTI) In an unusual move, China has demoted a ruling Communist party official in the volatile Uygur Muslim majority Xinjiang province for not "daring" to smoke in front of local religious leaders, regarding it as a sign of timidity in fighting against extremism. 
Jelil Matniyaz, the party chief of a village in Hotan, Xinjiang was demoted from "senior staff member" to "staff member" on March 25 for his "infirm political stands...and for being afraid to smoke in front of religious figures," a notice posted on the Hotan Dailys social media WeChat account said.
