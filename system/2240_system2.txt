Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST)s plan to procure 100 new mini buses, including 50 air-conditioned ones under Maharashtra governments Tajaswini scheme for women, may run into a delay. 
Also, the mini buses wont serve any purpose and adversely affect the efficiency of the BEST engineering department, they said.Suhas Samant, a Sena member on the committee said that the buses, which have a steel body will corrode fast like JCBLbuses. 
He suggested buying 50 buses from Tata.Under its recently launched Tejaswini scheme, the Maharashtra government has allotted Rs90 crore for 300 new buses in cities like Pune, Nagpur, Kalyan-Dombivli. 
We do not want people to unnecessarily blame our party for buying these buses, he said.A BEST official said that they were going for mini buses because they were faster on congested roads.
