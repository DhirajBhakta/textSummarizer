But..when Sheena and I tried to tell Peter about this lie, he asked Indrani and she strongly refuted it, insisting this was not true and that they were in fact her siblings and not her children.Indrani would have then been extremely angry with Sheena for disobeying her most important instruction and undermining her.Peter didn't know the truth of Sheena and Indrani's relationship.
