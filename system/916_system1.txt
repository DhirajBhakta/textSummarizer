Its an understatement to say it wasnt a great situation  The problem was I couldnt move to get out of there.I had a phone with me but I fell from such a height into the water it was unretrievable.Nicholls said his kneecap was destroyed in the fall and would need a complete reconstruction.It took two hours for emergency services to get him to International Koh Samui hospital, the Sun reported, adding that Nicholls medical bills will run into tens of thousands of pounds.Last month American tourist Geoffrey Maui, 28, died after falling at the same waterfall.Nicholls debuted in EastEnders in 1996 as Joe Wicks.
