Mumbai, Jun 21 (PTI) Actor Arjun Rampal, whose film "Daddy" is based on the life of Arun Gawli, says the movie is not an attempt to glorify the life of the gangster-turned- politician. 
The 44-year-old actor insists that it should be left to the audience to form an opinion about Gawli after watching the biopic, directed by Ashim Ahluwalia of "Miss Lovely" fame. 
Its not that we are making a propaganda film about him... 
The actor does not believe that he has taken a risk by making a biopic on a gangster rather than opting for an achievers life as is the norm in Bollywood.
