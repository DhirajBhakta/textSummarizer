Residents of Khar, Santacruz and Bandra have been protesting since July 7 to demand that the  Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) solve complaints they have filed in the public grievance registration system over the past 18  months. 
ALM president Aftab Siddique said 192 complaints by citizens about civic issues in the past 18 months have not been resolved. 
A few protesters sit outside the ward office and at Linking Road alternatively to avoid the BMC from taking action against them. 
complaints include illegal encroachments, drainage issues, potholes, tree cutting and other common problems faced by residents and shopkeepers of Shirley, Khar, Chuim, Santacruz and Bandra areas.
