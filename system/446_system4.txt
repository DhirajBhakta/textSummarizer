goes the Socialist Party-sanctioned remix of the catchy dance song, which was played during Maduro?
a grinning and clapping Maduro called out to the crowd, which roared back in approval. 
At no point was I asked, nor did I authorize, the use or the change in lyrics of Despacito for political ambitions, and much less in the middle of a deplorable situation that Venezuela, a country I love so much, is living,? 
Critics say Maduro is trying to cement a dictatorship by pushing forward with the Constituent Assembly this Sunday. 
He says it is the only way to bring peace back to the convulsed nation.
