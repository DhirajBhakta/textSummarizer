Delhi could soon lose all its seven elephants with the state forest department planning to shift them to a sanctuary outside the national capital. ?
The report has been submitted to the high court earlier this month.The city has seven domesticated elephants owned by four people. 
While six are kept at Sangam Vihar in Wazirabad, one is kept at a JJ cluster in Laxmi Nagar.The owners of the elephants have requested the forest officials not to separate them from the elephants as the animals would die without them. 
The committee, after inspecting the animals, found that not only the elephants were kept in poor conditions but it was also risky to keep the elephants in crowded localities.
