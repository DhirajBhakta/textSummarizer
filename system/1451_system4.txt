Smartphones can now help you finish your math homework by giving step-by-step solutions to hard-to-crack algebra equations, thanks to a new artificial intelligence (AI) app developed by engineers including one of Indian origin. 
Every student takes math, often for multiple years, and it can be hard to get help from parents and friends," said Shreyans Bhansali, Head of Engineering at Socratic. 
The app reads math questions - even handwritten ones - and gives students step-by-step solutions and explanations that teach them the underlying concepts and help answer all types of math problems. 
To build the app, the team looked through countless math questions asked by students and categorised them by the steps required to solve them.
