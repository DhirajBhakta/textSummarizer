He has been away from the hullabaloo of Indian cricket for the last six months but former BCCI president Anurag Thakur said if required, he wont shy away from accepting responsibility.The Supreme Court recently dropped perjury charges against Thakur after he tendered an unconditional apology. 
I feel humbled when a former India captain says something like that. 
I have not decided anything but if Indian cricket requires me, I will be always available.
