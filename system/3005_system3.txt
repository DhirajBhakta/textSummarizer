The Aam Aadmi Party has landed in a fresh controversy related to its party office. 
The Delhi government's PWD department has served a notice on the political group to pay Rs 27 lakh as fine for having failed to vacate its Rouse Avenue office within the stipulated time.Mail Today is in possession of a copy of the notice served to the Aam Aadmi Party.The notice was served on Tuesday in reply to the party's plea in which party requested to continue its operations from the 206, Rouse Avenue address. 
It was addressed to the Aam Aadmi Party's national secretary Pankaj Kumar Gupta.The letter written by deputy secretary, Debasis Biswal mentions that there is no provision under the rules to extend the "illegal occupation". 
Hence, the party is liable to pay a penal rent for the period of unauthorised occupation, says the notice.RS 27 LAKH FINE The amount which has been calculated by the department up to May 31 amounts to Rs 27,73,802, says the letter. 
The letter further says that the dues will further accrue up to the date the premises are finally vacated.In another notice, the government also turned down the proposal of party in which it asked for an alternative accommodation before vacating the Rouse Avenue office.Delhi Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal, in early April, had cancelled the allotment of 206, Rouse Avenue premises as the party office of AAP. 
The bungalow was allocated through a state cabinet decision of the Aam Aadmi Party last year.In an earlier communication to the government, L-G Anil Baijal had communicated to the government that he was within his right to cancel the allocation of the office as it had been usurped by violating the rules.In a note written to the Government which has challenged LG order Baijal has written that it is a clear case of conflict of interest as Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal is also the convenor of Aam Aadmi Party and hence action can be taken on that front as well.
