The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said his party would not frustrate the process for invoking article 50 but would seek to amend the governments bill. 
The president of the supreme court, Lord Neuberger of Abbotsbury, delivered a summary of the decision, which has far-reaching constitutional implications.Reading the summary, Neuberger said: By a majority of eight to three, the supreme court rules that the government cannot trigger article 50 without an act of parliament authorising it to do so.Section 2 of the 1972 [European Communities] Act provides that, whenever EU institutions make new laws, those new laws become part of UK law.
