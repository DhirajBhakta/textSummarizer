Nawaz Sharif, still smarting from the shock disqualification by the Supreme Court for dishonesty, wants to know if everyone else in Pakistan was Sadiq and Ameen or honest and righteous.The apex court on Friday disqualified 67-year-old Sharif for dishonesty and ruled that corruption cases be filed against him and his children over the Panama Papers scandal, forcing him to resign from premiership.The courts ruling stated that Sharif had been dishonest in not disclosing his earnings from a Dubai-based company of his son in his nomination papers during the 2013 general election.One of the apex court judges, Justice Ejaz Afzal Khan, said that Sharif was no longer eligible to be an honest member of the parliament.Addressing leaders of his Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) on Saturday, Sharif said, You should be proud that your leader doesnt have a stain of corruption on him.I am proud that I have not been declared ineligible over charges of corruption, he said at the PML-Ns parliamentary meeting that approved his brother and Punjab chief minister Shehbaz Sharif as his successor.The former premier claimed he did not receive any kickbacks or commissions and never compromised on principles.When I never took a salary, what would I declare, he said, referring to the Supreme Court judgement that led to his ouster.
