An H/West ward official said 40 stalls that were blocking traffic were demolished at Tilak Road, MG Road and Kanubai Desai Road in Santacruz (west). 
The action is part of a BMC drive against establishments setting up sheds and stalls that encroach onto public spaces  meant to be kept free and open for easy access by fire engines in case of an emergency.
