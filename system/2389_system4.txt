t get that missed break point out of his mind. 15-30 on his serve, and he looks annoyed. 
s still 5-2 ahead and he now has two points on his serve ... a gasp as Federer loses the point for 5-3 ... but a cheer and standing ovation as he brings up three set points at 6-3 ... 
Another punishing return, 30-40, the first break point of this second set. 
Second set: *Federer 7-6, 1-1 Berdych (*denotes next server)Federer looks like he may carve out the chance for an early break in the second set at 30-all. 
ll now have two points on his serve to take the first set ... 6-4 Federer, two set points ... and one will do!
