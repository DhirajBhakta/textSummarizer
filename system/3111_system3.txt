But credulity peaks when it comes to religion and religious beliefs.The Telangana man who dug up a national highway hoping to find Shiva ling is the latest example for devout belief in religion.? The incident happened near Pembarthy village in Jangaon district of Telangana after a self-proclaimed godman -- Lakhan Manoj -- informed the villagers that Lord Shiva appeared in his dream, asked him to build a gigantic Shiva temple for him at a certain location and said that a Shiva ling is hiding underneath.Adding insult to injury, hundreds of villagers who believed the lunatic gathered and dug up the national highway to have a 'darshan' of Lord Shiva's ling.Special prayers were conducted before unearthing of the national highway began.
