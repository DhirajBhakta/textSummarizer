New Delhi, Jul 28 (PTI) No proposal is under consideration to scrap the Sahayak system in the Army, the government today said, notwithstanding rising cases of jawans coming out openly against the colonial-era provision. 
"No proposal for scrapping the Sahayak system, presently in place in the Army, is under consideration in the Ministry at present," he said, in a brief written reply. 
Last month, a senior Army official had said that the force is actively considering recruiting civilian staff in peace stations to do away with the Sakayak system. 
To a separate question, Bhamre said complaints by serving soldiers are dealt with by authorities concerned according to existing rules and policies. 
He said a study conducted by the Defence Institute of Psychological Research concluded that the major causes of suicides in the Army are domestic problems, marital discord, stress and financial problems.
