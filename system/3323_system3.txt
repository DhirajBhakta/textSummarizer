Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has ruled himself out of the PM race in 2019. 
Speaking to reporters on the sideline of an event in Patna, Nitish said he has no interest in taking the top post."
I was elected as party (JD-U) president as Sharadji (Yadav) couldn't continue on the post. 
But this was seen as my aspiration for a national role...which is wrong," he said. 
"It will be great if President Pranab Mukherjee is given a second term. 
I will support the move, but the final decision has to be taken by the Centre," he said. 
Nitish also sought to divert the issue, saying matters concerning company laws come under the Centre's purview. 
"There is an attempt to divert people's attention towards such issues. 
This is happening in a well planned manner," the Bihar chief minister said.ON EVM CONTROVERSYNitish Kumar also rejected claims by parties like the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and Mayawati's BSP that the Electronic Voting Machines (EVM) could be tampered with to favour a particular party."
I believe there is no issue with EVM but if questions are being raised...it would be good if they are answered comprehensively,"? he said.
