While BJP legislator Raj Purohit demanded that students in schools and colleges made to compulsorily sing the national song, Waris Pathan of the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) and Abu Asim Azmi of Samajwadi Party (SP) said such a move was against their religion. 
He said the demand would be raised in the Assembly, too, at an appropriate time. 
Our religion does not allow us to worship anything else but Allah. 
We respect the Constitution of India, which does not have any compulsory provision of singing the national song,he told mediapersons. 
Pathan found support from Azmi. 
It is against the teaching of our religion and no Muslim will sing it, said AzmiRaote waded into the controversy, saying those who do not want to worship their motherland should shift to Pakistan. 
Vande Mataram denotes independence of the country, and if anybody has issues with it, they should shift to Pakistan. 
I do not understand why they have such affection for Pakistan, he told mediapersons.
