Abhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan are set to come together after seven years in Anurag Kashyap's Gulab Jamun, if reports are to be believed. 
Buzz is that Amitabh Bachchan might also play a pivotal role in the film.In fact, speculation suggests that Abhishek is dropping a major hint through his throwback post on Instagram last week, where he shared a photo with Aishwarya from the sets of Raavan, that their jodi is ready to return on screen.
