She will essay the role of Sanjay's mother Nargis Dutt in the biopic directed by Rajkumar Hirani. 
But it's not easy to play Dutt's mother when she has worked with Sanju baba in a handful of films in the 90s. 
Koirala in an interview to Mid-Day opened up on signing the film and playing Nargis Dutt on screen. 
I have to play Baba's (Sanjay Dutt) mother now?' 
I had my reservations as I would end up playing mother's roles. 
I thought to myself, when will I get to play Nargis Dutt again. 
When I told my mother, she was excited about it. 
I am looking forward to the film," she added.
