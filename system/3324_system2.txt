Koirala in an interview to Mid-Day opened up on signing the film and playing Nargis Dutt on screen. 
I had my reservations as I would end up playing mother's roles. 
I thought to myself, when will I get to play Nargis Dutt again. 
Directed by Rajkumar Hirani, the film also stars Ranbir Kapoor, Sonam Kapoor, Paresh Rawal, Vicky Kaushal and Karishma Tanna.
