The Padmini palace, located inside the historical Chittorgarh Fort, was at the receiving end of an act of vandalism by some men who broke the mirror work there. 
The Fort, situated in Rajasthan's Chittorgarh district and the folklore surrounding it, had been at the centre of attention after the attack on film director Sanjay Leela Bhansali and his unit during the making of the movie Padmavati in Jaipur and the subsequent brouhaha.A few days back, Karni Sena had issued a warning seeking the removal of the mirrors there. 
The fringe outfit claimed Padmavati had committed Jauhar (an act of killing self) to protect the Rajput honour and vehemently refuted that Allaudin Khilji had seen Padmavati's face through a mirror or there was any romantic liaison between the two .
