A group of men allegedly broke into the house of Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari and assaulted his staff shortly after midnight on Sunday in retaliation to a road rage dispute in central Delhi. 
The group assaulted Tiwaris personal assistant and a cook, said Singh, adding that a police team reached after Tiwaris staff called the police control room. 
My staff members were so terrified that they had to hide in my bedroom and other parts of the house, said Tiwari.
