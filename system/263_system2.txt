A court order protecting them and several reports pointing out their importance notwithstanding, wetlands across the state continue to be destroyed. 
Between 2012 and 2017 alone, 523 cases of wetland destruction were reported, a report compiled by the Mumbai-based NGO Vanashakti revealed at the National Mangrove Conference in Dona Paula, Goa, on Thursday. 
In 2014, the Bombay HC banned reclamation and construction on wetlands after Vanashakti filed a PIL to protect them. 
Stalin said even during the wetland grievance redressal committee meetings (formed by the state as per HC directions), corporations and revenue departments refused to restore degraded wetlands citing poor funds and lack of places to dump debris from wetlands. ?
The Vanashakti data comes a week after HT reported the state had directed every district to document wetlands larger than 2.25 hectares by September, to protect them. 
Beefing up security and tightening laws were the only ways to protect wetlands, experts said. ?
