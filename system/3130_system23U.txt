In what could be a first, MoS for Finance Arjun Ram Meghwal on Sunday instructed authorities to help villagers in his constituency - Rajasthan's Bikaner - after climbing a tree.A bad cellphone signal forced the MP to take desperate measures, and a special ladder was ordered to help him. 
Meghwal's visit came after residents of Bikaner's Dholiya village complained that the local hospital wasn't staffed with nurses.
