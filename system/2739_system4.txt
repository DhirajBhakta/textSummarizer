After a few hours of treatment, the baby was declared dead.Responding to the incident, the doctors said ECG machines were not working in the morning.Last month, a similar case of negligence took place at Delhi's Safdarjung hospital, when the maternity ward attendants at the hospital told 27-year-old Rohit Tandon that his wife Shanti had given birth to a stillborn baby.The doctor and the nursing staff sealed the body in a packet, labelled it and gave it to the father. 
It was at home when Rohit unfolded the sheet to take a last look at his 'lost' son, he felt signs of life in the frail body.However, the case took a tragic turn as the newborn died after struggling to survive for 30 hours.
