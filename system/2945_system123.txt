Rashid Latif has extended a hand of friendship towards Virender Sehwag after his tirade on social media created a storm in India. 
In the course of the Champions Trophy, Latif had used derogatory language over Sehwag's witty remarks on social media. 
However, Pakistan came back strongly from their dismal start to first storm into the final and then defeating India, the pre-tournament favourites.
