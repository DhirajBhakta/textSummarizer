This was said as part of Taapsees anecdote about her first film, but this got angry fan reactions like ungrateful, a hypocrite and a backstabber for supposedly forgetting her roots and taking a dig at such a veteran.Talking to Hindustan Times, Taapsee says, Er, what did I take a dig at Hes known for that. 
She says, Trust me, him or me, both of us are really unperturbed by whatever I have said, because Ive seen the video and he has seen it, too, along with his family, and we are all laughing at it.Maintaining that she didnt say anything disrespectful about anyone, Taapsee quips that the only person she disrespected or made fun of in the entire chat video was herself.
