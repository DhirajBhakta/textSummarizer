Minister Thiruvananthapuram, Jan 3 (PTI) Keralas tourism sector has registered an estimated loss of about Rs 1,000 crore, following a dip in the arrival of foreign and domestic tourists since the Centre announced demonetisation of high-value currencies, the state government said today. 
"The currency crunch arose during the tourism season itself and so, things went wrong to a great extent," Surendran said, adding that foreign tourists were not getting enough cash at airports on their arrival.
