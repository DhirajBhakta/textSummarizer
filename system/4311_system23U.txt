WhatsApp may soon bring your good old status. 
The chat app recently killed the old status to launch a new Facebook-like Status tab to its interface. 
The update received mixed reactions from the users with many backlashing the company for removing the old status and turning the app into Facebook. 
The new update which bumps the version up to 2.17.95 allows beta testers to put up a status text message, which is reflected on their profile page.
