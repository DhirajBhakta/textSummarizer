"Bowlers are pretty much second-class citizens in white-ball cricket," says former New Zealand pacer Shane Bond, who feels odds are stacked heavily against them in the limited-overs format.Writing for the International Cricket Council ahead of the upcoming Champions Trophy in England starting June 1, Bond said limited-overs cricket is "a batsman's game"."
The change in fielding restrictions in the last 10 overs of a one-day international has eased the pressure on the bowlers a little bit, but only a little bit," he said."...but for the most part, the bowlers are pretty much second-class citizens in white-ball cricket," he added.Bond said it is this imbalance which has led to spinners using negative tactics."
