At a meeting here, Khattar said the tagging of 89.3 per cent of cattle in gaushalas and nandishalas (shelters for bovine animals) has been completed and Haryana would be made stray cattle-free by August 15, 2017. 
The work to rehabilitate abandoned cattle is being undertaken in a mission mode and 27,000 animals have already been accommodated in gaushalas, he said. 
The districts of Nuh, Yamunanagar and Fatehabad have already been declared stray cattle-free and the other districts would achieve this target by June 30, he said.
