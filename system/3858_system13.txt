AAP found ammunition to gun for the BJP on Monday after it emerged that the saffron party's Inderpuri candidate for this month's municipal polls, who was touted as a slum dweller and the face of the city's urban poor, happens to be a millionaire. 
Tiwari, who was on a visit to the Inderpuri slums this New Year's Eve, met the woman who came to the BJP president alleging that "politicians never listened to the problems of the poor". straight talk, Tiwari assured her of a "solution" and it surprised many when he declared Kaushik as the BJP's candidate from the local municipal ward.
