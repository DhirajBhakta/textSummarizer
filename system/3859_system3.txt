Peshawar, Apr 9 (PTI) Pakistan is planning to sell donkeys to China after an investment of Rs 1 billion in its Donkey Development Programme, in a bid to attract Chinese investors in the northwestern Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province. 
Steps are being initiated to increase the population of donkeys in the province as the animals are highly valued in China for their hides which are used to manufacture medicines among other things, according to an official document. 
The donkey export proposal would be presented to investors during a two-day road show in China this month, it said. 
"The proposed project will help improve the socio-economic status of donkey-rearing communities by improving the health and production of local donkeys. 
The Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa government will "develop linkages in order to improve prices of donkeys and enhance the income of breeders and traders," it added. 
The proposed cost of the project is Rs 1 billion, but the document insisted the scheme will meet "not only its investment cost but also generate a good amount of revenue".
