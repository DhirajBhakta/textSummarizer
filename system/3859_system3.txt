Peshawar, Apr 9 (PTI) Pakistan is planning to sell donkeys to China after an investment of Rs 1 billion in its Donkey Development Programme, in a bid to attract Chinese investors in the northwestern Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province. 
Steps are being initiated to increase the population of donkeys in the province as the animals are highly valued in China for their hides which are used to manufacture medicines among other things, according to an official document. 
The Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa-China Sustainable Donkey Development Programme worth Rs 1 billion (USD 9.5 million) is one of the many investment portfolios prepared by the province to attract Chinese investment in its agriculture sector under the ambitious USD 46 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, the Express Tribune reported.
