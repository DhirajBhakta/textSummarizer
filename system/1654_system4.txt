about the proposed expansion, arguing that allowing 16 more countries to qualify would reduce the quality of the football.Referring to his election last February on a proposal to expand the World Cup to 40 teams, Infantino said the prime objection from European clubs had been to increasing the number of matches played, and the tournament?
He said Fifa administrators had since examined four different formats and found that the 48-team expansion could address those concerns.The immediate move to a 32-team knockout competition after the two matches played by each country in the first round of 16 groups, means the finalists will have played seven games, the same as in the current format.
