Samajwadi Party leader and former chief minister Akhilesh Yadav's uncle Ram Gopal Yadav said one should give Yogi Adityanath at least six months to start work and deliver on the BJP's promises to people in Uttar Pradesh."
There is no need to start attacking him from the first day," said Ram Gopal Yadav as Gorakhpur MP Adityanath spent his first day in the chief minister's office today.WHAT RAM GOPAL YADAV HAD TO SAY ABOUT ADITYANATHRajya Sabha MP Ram Gopal Yadav, who helped nephew Akhilesh Yadav dethrone father Mulayam Singh Yadav from the SP president's post, said there was nothing objectionable in Yogi Adityanath holding a puja at his house before moving in."
Doing puja is a normal practice in Hindu tradition before starting on a new project," Ram Gopal Yadav said, reacting to reports on Yogi Adityanath getting a team of seven priests from Gorakhpur to perform puja at the CM's official residence at 5, Kalidas Marg in Lucknow.The Samajwadi Party leader also lauded Adityanath's directive to his ministers to declare their source of income and assets to the party and the chief minister's office within 15 days. 
FINGER-POINTING STARTS IN SAMAJWADI PARTYFollowing the Samajwadi Party's humiliating loss in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly election, finger pointing has begun and Ram Gopal Yadav could face some tough questions from party seniors. 
However, once the election results were announced, father Mulayam Singh had defended son Akhilesh and said the responsibility for the defeat should not entirely fall on the young Yadav's shoulders.As father and son try to put up a united face after election, many expect the party to take some tough decisions to put the house in order.
