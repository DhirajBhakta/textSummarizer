New Delhi, Feb 13 (PTI) Vishal Sikka, the embattled chief of Infosys, today said he has always shared a "heartfelt, warm relationship" with the companys co-founder N R Narayana Murthy. 
The comments come at a time when there has been a lot of buzz around some of the founders flagging concerns about governance lapses at Infosys and issues like hike in Sikkas compensation to USD 11 million and huge severance pay doled out to former executives, Rajiv Bansal and David Kennedy. 
Describing Murthy as an "incredible man", Sikka said the two usually discussed topics like quantum physics and technology whenever they met.
