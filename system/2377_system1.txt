Kabir Khan and Salman Khan duo gave the year 2015 its most successful Bollywood movie-- Bajrangi Bhaijaan. 
This year, audience was expecting a similar kind of collaboration between the two, when their film, Tubelight, arrived in cinema halls on June 25.But it all turned out exactly the opposite. 
The film failed to impress the critics and the audience, so much so that some of them even dubbed it as Salman?
