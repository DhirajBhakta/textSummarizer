New Delhi, Feb 21 (PTI) The Jet Airways aircraft flying from London, which lost contact with the ATC over European airspace while on its way to Mumbai, was a training flight for the pilot-in-command at the time of the incident, sources said. 
The incident happened on February 16 when the Mumbai- London flight 9W-118, carrying 330 passengers and 15 crew members, lost contact with the Air Traffic Control (ATC) reportedly for almost 33 minutes. 
Though, the Czech aviation authorities tried contacting the pilot of the flight 9W-118 on emergency frequency, the pilot missed it due to howling noise," airline sources said.
