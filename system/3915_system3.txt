As reports came in that the fly ban on Shiv Sena MP Ravindra Gaikwad, who was blacklisted by airlines after he assaulted an Air India staffer at New Delhi airport last month, may be lifted soon, the party questioned the 'aukat' of Air India's Chairman and Managing Director (CMD)."
Shiv Sena MP Anandrao Adsul gave the adjournment notice stating that decision taken by Air India and other private airlines is a violation of fundamental rights.Home Minister Rajnath Singh assured that discussions will be held with the stakeholders to find an "amicable solution" at the earliest.Gaikwad tendered an apology to Parliament but insisted that he owed no apology to the airline officials as he sought removal of the ban imposed on him by domestic airlines."
