I thought it would be great to use a brain-computer instrument to enable patients to play music again without requiring movement.Deuel originally developed the Encephalophone (patent pending) in his own independent laboratory, in collaboration with Felix Darvas, a physicist at the University of Washington.  
The Encephalophone can be controlled via two independent types of brain signals: either those associated with the visual cortex (ie closing ones eyes), or those associated with thinking about movementThe Encephalophone is based on brain-computer interfaces using an old method, called electroencephalography, which measures electrical signals in the brain.
