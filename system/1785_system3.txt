Islamic State wants to carry out a mass casualty attack in Britain and has no moral barrier to using chemical weapons, a minister has said.The security minister Ben Wallace said there were reports of Isis using chemical weapons in Syria and Iraq, where it controls large areas, and that Moroccan authorities had apprehended a cell in February which was harbouring substances that could be used to make either a bomb or a deadly toxin.He also pointed to a recent Europol report that warned of the chemical threat and the potential realisation of everybodys worst fear.He told the Sunday Times that the groups ambition was definitely mass casualty attacks. 
We have to be on our guard for the enemy within, he said.The insider threat, as we would call it, is real and it can be exploited and there are people trying to do that as we speak.THis comment comes after a year in which Europe suffered a spate of terror attacks using less sophisticated means.In two of the most high-profile attacks in Nice and Berlin, lone attackers drove lorries through crowds of people celebrating Bastille Day and browsing a Christmas market.
