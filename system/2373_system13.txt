Police said  an inmate who was lodged in Bhondsi jail sought the help of gangster Manjeet Mahal to threaten the other group lead by Rakesh, which had claimed the plot on the upscale Golf Course Road. 
However, as the phone call was made from jail, the police got active after getting the complaint and booked the inmate as well as ASI Raj Singh of the crime branch, and took him into custody for further questioning.
