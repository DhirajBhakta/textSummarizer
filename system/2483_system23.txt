Talking to us exclusively on these cuts, CBFC chairperson, Pahlaj Nihalani argues that the mere deletion or beeping of six words is no reason to feel creatively smothered when those words indicate a clear contempt for Indian culture and democracy.Says Nihalani, I have been flooded with calls from print and television channels asking why weve beeped six words in the documentary. 
At another point in the documentary, there is a reference to the enemy in India being religious leadership.Weve asked for India to be removed here.The third word weve ordered cut is when Prof Sen speaks of India being interpreted as Hindu.
