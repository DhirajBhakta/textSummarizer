A six-month-old medical report from a mohalla clinic in Delhi showing an abnormally high blood sugar level of 9,481.7 mg/dl for a patient, has gone viral on social media.The normal level is usually less than 140 mg/dl, post meals.The AAP government, which runs the clinics, has however dismissed the report as forged, saying such messages are being spread to discredit the mohalla clinic system.The HbA1c test result, which measures the average blood glucose level over a period of time, shows the glucose levels of the patient are 332%, whereas a healthy person should have below 6%.This report resurfaced on Twitter on Friday, days after Delhis vigilance team started investigation into mohalla clinic doctors, calling patients for unnecessary follow-ups.Twitterati went berserk with comments, blaming doctors and the labs for botched tests and treatment.OMG!!!
