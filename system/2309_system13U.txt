But not anymore.Ever since the Mumbai-based comedy group All India Bakchod (AIB) used his photograph alongside a morphed picture of Modi with dogs ears and a snout superimposed, triggering a controversy, Ramachandran, 61, has grown tired of his resemblance with the prime minister.I will shave off my beard next week, he said on Saturday. 
With his grey hair and beard, he looked uncannily similar to the prime minister and the photograph went viral on social media.The photograph was picked up thereafter by the AIB for taking a crack at the prime minister.
