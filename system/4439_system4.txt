New Delhi, Feb 28 (PTI) MPs and MLAs should be recalled within two years from being elected if 75 per cent of those who voted for them are not satisfied with their performance, according to a bill moved by BJP MP Varun Gandhi. 
If three-fourth of the votes that member was polled in his election, go in favour of the recall process, the member will be recalled, the bill proposes. 
"A free and fair election is the right of the citizens of the country and in the event of their elected representatives no longer enjoying their confidence, the people must have a right to remove them," Varun said.
