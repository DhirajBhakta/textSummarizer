In a setback to the minority Hindu and Sikh communities in Jammu and Kashmir, the Mehbooba Mufti-led PDP-BJP government in the state, through an affidavit filed in the Supreme Court, has opposed creation of a minority commission in the state.The state government was responding to a PIL filed by a Jammu-based lawyer Ankur Sharma, seeking a direction to set up a minority commission in the state to safeguard the interests of religious and linguistic minorities. 
"In the absence of a minority commission, the benefits exclusively meant for the minority communities including crores worth aid are being given away to a certain community, which is the majority Muslim community, in an illegal and arbitrary manner," Sharma had submitted.Jammu and Kashmir law secretary Abdul Majid Bhat contended that Sharma's view, saying, "Assertion of the petitioner for setting up a state minority commission in Jammu and Kashmir through proper legislation including time-bound identification and notification of religious and linguistic minorities by the state is legally not maintainable.
