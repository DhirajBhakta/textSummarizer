He also said that She (Gurmehar) is being made a pawn.But Bollywood lyricist and poet Javed Akhtar hit out at Union minister of state for home affairs Kiren Rijiju on Tuesday for hinting that Kaur was being influenced by political rivals.I don't about her but Mr Minister I know who is polluting your mind .
