scrapped New Delhi, May 4 (PTI) An RSS affiliate today sought the sports ministrys intervention for annulment of BCCIs contract with Chinese firm Oppo for sponsoring the Indian cricket team. 
The SJM said Indian cricket team members should not wear clothes bearing the logo of Oppo. 
"This would not only misguide our youth in blindly going for buying Chinese brands but would also place us in a very awkward position and our campaign is likely to get badly affected by this," SJMs national co-convener Ashwani Mahajan said in the letter.
