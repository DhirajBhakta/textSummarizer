This was comparatively far less in Chande village that has among the lowest compensations in Shahapur, said a Thane district collectorate official.The Thane collectorate has also worked out rates for Kalyan taluka, which are far lower than Shahapur, with the highest compensation being Rs1.50 crore for an hectare of land or Rs62 lakh for an acre of land. 
The lowest compensation here is around Rs61.14 lakh for an hectare of land or Rs25.47 lakh for an acre of land.The district administration may revise the land rates for Kalyan taluka given that farmers are likely to react negatively given the high rates offered  in neighbouring Shahapur taluka.
