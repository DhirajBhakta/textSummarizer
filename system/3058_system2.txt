Kolkata will soon have an underwater Metro which will pass through tunnels several feet under the Hooghly. 
The first underwater transportation tunnel of India is ready with the second one nearing completion. 
The Kolkata Metro transportation tunnel is unique to India because never before in the history of the country has a tunnel been made under a flowing river.The tunnel has been constructed 30 metres below riverbed, just a few metres away from the famous Howrah Bridge, built in the last century to connect Howrah and Kolkata. 
There aren't even roads that are under a river in India making the Kolkata Metro tunnel a complete technology marvel which will see trains will chugging through it every two and a half minutes."
These type of tunnel-boring machines, which we call 'earth pressure balancing tunnel boring machines', have been used for the first time in Eastern India," said Satish Kumar, Managing Director of Kolkata Metro Rail Corporation Ltd.Another interesting point is that more than 10 lakh tonne of mud has been dug out for the construction of this tunnel. 
The tunnel-boring machines were used for the first time in eastern India.The entire 16.6-kilometre stretch of the first tunnel is ready.
