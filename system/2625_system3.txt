But a few days before its release, the makers were in for a shock when the Central Board of Film Certification decided to give it a U/A certificate. 
But according to a report in DNA, CBFC did find something objectionable and has asked parents to accompany their kids during the film. 
This decision has made the makers quite unhappy. 
The film revolves around the story of a boy in search of his father. 
However, Censor Board chief Pahlaj Nihalani had this to say in his defense, "Let the film release. 
The world will see why we think it is necessary for children to be accompanied by an adult."
Directed by Anurag Basu, Jagga Jasoos also stars Saurabh Shukla and Sayani Gupta.
