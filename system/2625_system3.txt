Ever since Ranbir and Katrina began the promotion of the film, Jagga Jasoos is touted to be a fantasy film meant for the children. 
But according to a report in DNA, CBFC did find something objectionable and has asked parents to accompany their kids during the film. 
A source close to director Anurag Basu was quoted as telling the daily, "We wonder what the censor board saw in Jagga Jasoos that made it suitable for children only accompanied by an adult."
