After Governor Ch Vidyasagar Rao, who also serves as chancellor of the public universities in the state, took cognisance of the issue and asked the MU to declare results by July 30, the university tried to speed up the process. 
Letters were issued to more than 1,000 teachers, who didnt show up to assess papers, warning them of the consequences of skipping the assessment work.However, the teachers have  asked the varsity to revoke the letter. 
Many of us are yet to be allotted CAP centres, said Balasaheb Salve, a teacher from BNN College, Bhiwandi, and a member of BUCTU.The protestors have suggested that delaying the results amounts to blocking job and higher education opportunities to the students.
