The rift in Bihars ruling grand alliance appeared to have widened as the Janata Dal (United) said on Friday that deputy chief minister Tejashwi Yadav should resign if his family fails to explain the source of funding for properties mired in an alleged scam.The JD(U)s demand, dismissed by RJD chief Lalu Prasad, followed efforts by Congress chief Sonia Gandhi to broker truce among the two allies.Chief minister Nitish Kumars JD(U) rules the state with the RJD and Congress, which together defeated the BJP in the 2015 assembly election.But RJD-JD(U) ties were strained after Prasad and his 26-year-old younger son, Tejashwi, were named in a land-for-hotels scandal, and the CBI raided their homes and other properties last week.
