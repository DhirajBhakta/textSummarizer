The actor said that growing up, her family was poor and she could not afford a car to go to school. 
Parineeti talked about being eve-teased as she cycled to school every day, and how she has become a stronger person as a result of facing such struggles very early in her life.However, if a guy supposedly from Parineeti's school, is to be believed, the actor's rags-to-riches story is a lie. 
Create a fabricated sob story of no money no car etc etc (sic)," he wrote.He added, "Coming from the same school I probably also remember the car her father used to have. 
My friends from CJM (Convent of Jesus and Mary) would probably understand the lies a bit better (sic)."
