By Komal Panchmatia New York, Jul 14 (PTI) Salman Khan has never been a favourite at award shows but the superstar has no complains as he said he prefers performing at such ceremonies over receiving an honour. 
The actor joked that even though he was not the best dancer, organisers are always ready to pay him a fat cheque. 
Shahid Kapoor, Alia Bhatt, Varun Dhawan, Kriti Sanon, Sushant Singh Rajput, Anupam Kher, Nawazuddin Siddiqui and cricketer-singer Dwayne Bravo were also in attendance at the press meet. 
I was a background dancer in 2006 and in 2013 I made my debut as a performer and in 2017, I got nominated."
