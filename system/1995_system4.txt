The courts remarks came as it dealt with a plea filed by Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) against the Delhi High Courts August 2014 judgement directing reinstatement of a constable, Abrar Ali, who was dismissed from service due to his alleged acts of indiscipline and misconduct. 
In its verdict, the apex court held that though Ali was found guilty of deserting the force for a period of five days and not improving his conduct in spite of penalties imposed on him on three earlier occasions, the penalty of dismissal from service is "excessive and harsh" and "in our view, the penalty of compulsory retirement would meet the ends of justice".
