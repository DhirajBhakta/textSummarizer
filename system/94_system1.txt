The MU had recently shifted to an online system for assessment of answer papers, which caused a delay in completing the assessment work. 
The NCP leader said the university had failed to meet the July 31 deadline given by the governor Ch Vidysagar Rao for completing assessment work. 
The government will make sure that the system is implemented smoothly in phases, he said.
