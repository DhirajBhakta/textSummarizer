He said, "I came to the programme a bit late. 
Just as I sat down, the anchor asked me the question, I answered without applying my mind to it. 
"Rao defended his statements saying, "But I was angry when they asked me if 'girls are harmful'. 
That's why I said woman are harmless and that's why we sleep with them.
