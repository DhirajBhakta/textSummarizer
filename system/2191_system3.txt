South Korea has offered to hold rare military talks with the North to ease tensions after Pyongyangs first intercontinental ballistic missile test earlier this month.Mondays offer, the first since South Korea elected the moderate Moon Jae-In as president, came as the Red Cross in Seoul proposed a separate meeting to discuss the reunion of families separated by the 1950-53 Korean war.The Souths defence ministry proposed a meeting on Friday at the border truce village of Panmunjom, while the Red Cross offered to hold talks on 1 August at the same venue.If the government meeting goes ahead, it will be the first official inter-Korea talks since December 2015. 
[NEW]The European Union offered European support for South Korean efforts to negotiate with North Korea, but said it was also considering tougher sanctions on Pyongyang following its first intercontinental ballistic missile test.In a statement Monday, the EUs executive arm condemned the test earlier this month as a serious threat to international peace and security and urged an end to such actions.The latest missile test  which Kim described as a gift to the Americans  was seen as a milestone in Pyongyangs quest to build a missile capable of carrying a nuclear warhead that can hit the US mainland.The proposed meetings, if realised, would be a rare opportunity to ease tension that has built up for 10 years, said Cheong Seong-chang, analyst at the Sejong Institute, a thinktank.It would at least help let off some steam out of the current crisis, although the North would still maintain that it would not give up its weapons programmes, he said.
