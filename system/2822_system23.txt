Offering a solution to hapless parents who are unable to bring up their newborns, the women and child development (WCD) ministry will now keep cradles at government hospitals, orphanages and police stations across the country where one can leave their child behind for adoption. 
"This will prove to be a safe place for orphaned, abandoned and surrendered children," said a senior ministry official.After a hospital or orphanage is notified by the ringing bell, officials will take the child into custody and he or she will handed over to the area's child welfare committee. 
The panel will further screen the child and decide if the baby is fit for adoption.REASONS FOR ABANDONMENTThe reasons for abandonment vary: an unwed mother facing social stigma; parents unable to look after their child, often because it is mentally or physically ill; or simply not wanting a girl. 
While critics argue it could create more problems than it solves, such as increase abandonment, other analysts maintain that forcing parents to keep unwanted children can lead to abuse and infanticide.The WCD ministry has identified private and government hospitals and orphanages as prime locations to place the cradles.
