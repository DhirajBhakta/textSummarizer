The Aussies, led by Steve Waugh, steamrolled India in Mumbai to extend their winning streak.Things looked just as bleak in the next Test at the Eden Gardens. 
Australia had piled up 445 and India were knocked out for 171 and following on, were tottering at 115/3 when Rahul Dravid joined VVS Laxman in the middle. 
The Eden crowd was aghast. 
Dravid was considered to be extremely talented but India had yet to see the flair they would go on to produce for the next decade.March 14, 2001 was when they first saw what these two could do. 
They were 254/4 at stumps on day 3. 
When the duo resumed proceedings on the fourth day, Australia would have hoped to wrap things up quickly.
