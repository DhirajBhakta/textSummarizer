By Yoshita Singh New York, Jun 18 (PTI) Leading online lodging service Airbnb is buying a California-based background-check startup founded by three Indian-origin entrepreneurs in 2014 as it seeks to protect its users and hosts from undesirable and fraudulent people. 
A report in Fortune magazine said Airbnb is buying Trooly, a startup that specialises in technology that helps conduct background checks.
