Imphal, Mar 24 (PTI) The newly elected BJP-led Manipur government today decided to do away with the process of interview in direct recruitment for junior level posts in all departments. 
It also decided to amend the existing recruitment rules for Grade III and IV posts accordingly, it added. 
The step will help government curb corruption, assist in more objective selection in a transparent manner and ease the problems of poor people, it said.
