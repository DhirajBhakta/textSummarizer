Many cricket fans blamed the al-rounder for the eventual loss. 
"Honestly the true followers of the game understand that such things (run out) happen sometimes. 
No one does it intentionally," Ravindra Jadeja told India Today. 
?"Everyone wants to represents the country and everyone has big dreams. 
There have been so many run outs in cricket, but it is part of the game and I don't think I need to worry so much about it," he added. 
?India has played a lot of cricket since then. 
Up next a Sri Lanka who will be trying to bounce back after an humiliating loss to Zimbabwe in the ODI series.? ?"Critics change their views after every series. 
I don't play the game for critics. 
I play for myself. 
I always aim to give my best in whatever conditions that I play in," he said on his critics questioning his overseas record. 
Jadeja is excited for a long and challenging tour of the island nation. 
India will play three Tests, five ODIs and a lone T20 international in Sri Lanka starting July 26"I like to perform when there are challenges. 
It was a special feeling. 
I don't realise anything now but as I spend more time with the baby, then I will get more attached.
