New Delhi, Apr 29 (PTI) The local pilots body of Jet Airways has deferred its decision to not fly with foreign pilots from next month. 
The National Aviators Guild, representing local pilots of Jet Airways, had earlier this month issued a directive to its members not to fly with expatriate commanders from May 1 after one of the foreign pilots allegedly assaulted a trainer in Bengaluru. 
The NAG had also alleged that the Jet Airways management treats its local pilots in a "step motherly" manner. 
At a meeting of NAG representatives, it has been decided to give Jet Airways time to address the issue, the source added. 
The meeting is now likely to happen next week.
