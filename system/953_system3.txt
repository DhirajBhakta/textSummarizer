China today called for an "immediate withdrawal" of Indian troops at Doklam "to avoid escalation", even as Beijing briefed foreign diplomatic missions in China on the stand-off at the trijunction."
"We hope the Indian side can get a clear understanding of the current situation and take immediate measures to bring back the personnel that illegally crossed the boundary so as to avoid escalation."
On the briefing with the foreign diplomatic missions in Beijing, Lu said: "The illegal trespass by the Indian border personnel has drawn extensive attention from the international community.""
Many foreign diplomatic missions in China said they were shocked by this and wanted to confirm whether it was true with the Chinese side," he said. 
The Sikkim section is mutually recognised by two sides and this time Indian border personnel illegally trespassed the boundary into China's territory," he said.
