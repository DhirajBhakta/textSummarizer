A Dewas court in Madhya Pradesh today acquitted Sadhvi Pragya Singh and seven others in former RSS pracharak Sunil Joshi murder case. 
Joshi, who had worked as an RSS pracharak for a significant part of his life, was shot dead a few hundred meters from his rented house in Chuna Khadan area of Dewas on December 29, 2007.Only the next day on December 30, a particular community was targeted and four members of a family were killed as Joshi's associates tried to give the murder a communal colour.Later it was suspected that Joshi was eliminated by his own associates so that the police could not track down the saffron terror trail that was allegedly involved in several blasts, including the Samjhauta blasts.
