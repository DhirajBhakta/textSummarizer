India today reacted sharply to The New York Times editorial criticising Prime Minister Narendra Modis choice of Aditya Nath Yogi as the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, and said the papers wisdom to write such a piece was "questionable". 
The NYT in the highly critical editorial, titled Modi's Perilous Embrace of Hindu Extremists, said since he was elected in 2014, Modi has played a "cagey game, appeasing his party's hard-line Hindu base while promoting secular goals of development and economic growth".
