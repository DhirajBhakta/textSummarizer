Ranbir Kapoor's new look from Sanjay Dutt's biopic has gone viral online but his onscreen wife Dia Mirza feels it should not have been leaked. 
I will admit it was upsetting that the look was out as we were saving the look to reveal much later. 
We are enthused with the response from the public but we wish the media had respected the privacy of the film and not revealed the look," Dia told reporters here. 
Rajkumar Hirani had directed me in Lage Raho Munnabhai and it was great to be working with him again," she said, adding, "Right now we all are tight-lipped about the film but we can't wait to reveal things."
