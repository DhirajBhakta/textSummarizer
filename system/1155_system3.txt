 A gang of four alleged carjackers, who learnt how to rob cars while playing their favourite game, Grand Theft Auto, on Playstation, was on Tuesday busted by Delhi Police crime branch. 
The gang members robbed cars and high-end mobile phones and used to thrash the occupants if they resisted. 
The four said while playing the Grand Theft Auto games, they hit upon the idea that they could get hold of luxury cars easily like the characters in the games by thrashing the occupants,? 
They used to target a particular car, followed it closely and at a convenient place, deliberately banged the car with their car, compelling the driver to stop. ?
