New Delhi, Jul 12 (PTI) The BJP today hit out at Rahul Gandhi for attacking Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and "not terrorism", after his return from "vacation", hours after the Congress vice president said Modis policies had created space for terrorists in Kashmir. 
I want to ask when Mani Shankar Aiyar (Congress leader) sought Pakistans help in removing Modi from power and bring in the Congress, was it Rahuls personal agenda or political agenda" she asked.
