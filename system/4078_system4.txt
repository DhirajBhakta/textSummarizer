Speaking at the MAIL TODAY Culture Conclave, he announced that both Romeo and Juliet are welcome in the city and there would be no Mogambo to object, referring to one of Hindi cinema's best-known villains.His remarks came against the backdrop of the UP government's controversial anti-Romeo drive, described as a crackdown on people harassing women in public places. 
One symbolises divine love and the other material love," the city's tourism and culture minister said.Indian culture is known to embrace dissenting voices, he pointed out.
