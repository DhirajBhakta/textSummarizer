The malice intention of Lashkar came under the radar of security agencies through a video, where its cofounder Amir Hamza is seen instigating his cadre to spread violence in Northeast, including Darjeeling and Sikkim.A recent video, believed to be shot in Lahore on July 19, has left security agencies in a tizzy. 
"if India will send its army in Bhutan to counter China, then along with Pakistan, Chinese troop will enter Srinagar," Hamza said in the video.Hamza was designated global terrorist by US in 2012 and is wanted by India for the November 2008 terror attacks in Mumbai that claimed over 160 lives and left more than 300 injured.
