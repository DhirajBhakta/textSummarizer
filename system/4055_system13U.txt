BT has been fined ?42m, the largest penalty imposed by regulator Ofcom, and will have to pay an estimated ?300m in compensation to rival telecoms companies over delays installing high-speed internet connections.Ofcom found that BT broke rules put in place to stop Openreach, its subsidiary that controls the UK broadband infrastructure network, abusing its significant market power by cutting compensation payments to rivals, blaming installation delays on factors beyond its control when this was not the case.BT said it expected to pay out ?300m in compensation to rivals including Sky, Vodafone and TalkTalk for the serious breach of Ofcoms rules.The size of our fine reflects how important these rules are to protect competition and, ultimately, consumers and businesses, said Gaucho Rasmussen, investigations director at Ofcom.
