Those who successfully complete the training but cannot be found a role within 90 days also receive the training free of charge.Further revelations about the Capita scheme come as it emerges that one of Capitas rivals, FDM Group, a FTSE-listed company which works with the Home Office and Ministry of Justice, also demands graduates sign up to months of unpaid training in order to secure jobs.The groups graduate programme includes up to 14 weeks of unpaid training, after which it says 99% of attendees are placed in a job.The company also demands that trainees pay up to ?20,000 if they leave during the training or the first two years of work.A spokeswoman for FDM said: The professional training we provide is a major financial investment in our people and in line with employers who invest in their people, we have clauses in our contracts that look to recoup the cost of training with a cap of ?20,000 if a person leaves during training or the first two years of consulting.
