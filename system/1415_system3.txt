Japans long wait for a homegrown sumo grand champion has ended after Kisenosato became the first Japanese wrestler to reach the ancient sports pinnacle in almost two decades.The 30-year-old became the sports 72nd yokozuna, or grand champion, after Japans sumo association approved his promotion on Wednesday in a move purists hope will mark the start of a challenge to years of dominance by overseas wrestlers.The last Japan-born wrestler to reach the top rank was Wakanohana in 1998.The 178kg Kisenosato  who has been criticised for letting several tournament titles slip through his hands  became a serious contender for promotion after winning the new years contest in Tokyo with a record of 14 victories and one defeat.At a ceremony at his stable on Wednesday morning, Kisenosato said he accepted his promotion with great humility. 
He added: I will show devotion and try not to disgrace the title of yokozuna.In recent years sumo has been dominated by wrestlers from Mongolia, Hawaii and Samoa.Earlier this week, with his promotion all but a formality, Kisenosato told reporters that the rank of yokozuna came with a special responsibility. 
I have nothing but gratitude.Kisenosatos ascent to sumos summit did not come easily: his historic victory on Sunday came at the end of his 73rd tournament as a professional, which is more than it has taken any other wrestler since 1926 to reach the top rank.His addition to the yokozuna ranks is also expected to help improve sumos image, after a decade in which it has been rocked by a series of scandals, including bullying, drug taking and allegations of match fixing.Kisenosato joins three other wrestlers at the rank of yokozuna, all of whom were born in Mongolia: Kakuryu, Harumafuji and Hakuho.
