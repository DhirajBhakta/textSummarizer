Our message is clear  we will not tolerate this sort of behaviour. 
Millions of people rely on BTs network for the phone and broadband services they use every day.Compensation must be paid to affected providers within 12 months, Ofcom said.The record ?42m penalty, which was reduced from ?60m after BT admitted full liability and agreed to pay back rivals, is more than 11 times greater than the previous largest fine levied on a telecoms operator by Ofcom. 
Last year, Vodafone was fined ?3.7m for taking pay-as-you-go customers money without providing a service. 
BTs fine is more than seven times that of the second largest penalty handed down, the ?5.7m ITV had to pay in 2008 over the abuse of premium-rate phone lines in a number of hit shows.Ofcoms investigation into BT focused on the installation of high-speed business lines, known as ethernet services, which provide connections for big businesses as well as organisations including schools, hospitals and libraries, between January 2013 and December 2014. 
It was instigated after a complaint from Vodafone, which relies on BT ethernet services to transmit data between its mobile masts. 
Vodafone accused Openreach of failing to meet its 30-day installation guarantee but then reclassifying the delay as having been agreed by rivals which allowed it to avoid paying compensation.These high-speed lines are a vital part of this countrys digital backbone, said Rasmussen. 
This shouldnt have happened and we fully accept Ofcoms findings. 
We take this issue very seriously and we have put in place measures, controls and people to prevent it happening again. 
My management team and I are determined that BT applies the highest standards when serving our customers.This month BT, which is to introduce inflation-busting price rises for its customers, denied it was forcing them to foot the bill to pay for its new ?1.2bn Champions League football rights deal.
