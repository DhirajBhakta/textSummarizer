If you thought that cops lack sense of humour, Delhi Police?
, Delhi Police is using funny, creative memes to counter social problems. 
These memes are helpful in establishing a connect with young people and they also popularise our on-ground campaigns to counter drug addiction, ragging and cyber crimes,? 
says Madhur Verma, DCP (Crime) and PRO, Delhi Police.  
Inspired by Bhaag Milkha Bhaag, this creative aims to sensitise youngsters on drug addiction. 
For example, drug consumers are often young people and to sensitise them, we have used Bollywood movie titles, as they are relatable. 
Our campaign hashtags are also inspired by Bollywood. 
What do young people think about the funny creatives?
