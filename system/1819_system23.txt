Jaipur/Srinagar, Dec 29 (PTI) Congress today demanded that Prime Minister Narendra Modi apologise to the nation for the "suffering" caused to the people by note-ban when he speaks on New Years eve and vowed to hold country-wide protests from January 6. 
Attacking Modi, who is set to address the nation after end of the 50-day period he had sought from the people to ease their problems due to cash crunch, Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said that the Prime Minister is good at making announcements that are far from reality.
