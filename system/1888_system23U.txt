Tokyo, Dec 26 (PTI) Scientists in Japan have developed a new urine-powered sensor that can alert caregivers when a diaper is wet and ready to be changed. 
Producing a sensor suitable for a diaper proved to be a challenge, researchers said. 
They first developed a urine sensor too rigid to embed into a diaper. 
Flexible embeddable battery and sensor contain a chemical potentially unsafe for humans and their charging times varied.
