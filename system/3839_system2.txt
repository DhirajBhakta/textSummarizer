New Delhi, Apr 11 (PTI) After regulator TRAI nixed its complimentary offer, Reliance Jio today announced a new plan of 1GB 4G data daily for 3 months at Rs 309 for its Prime members but rival Airtel dubbed the offer as a case of "old wine in a new bottle". 
"Considering the special benefits that are available to Jio Prime members, customers who were unable to subscribe to Jio Prime for any reason, can continue to do so by paying Rs?408 or Rs?608 (Jio Prime + recharge price) to avail these benefits," the statement added.
