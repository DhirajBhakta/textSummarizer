Shraddha Kapoors ambitious project Haseena Parker has been postponed again and the reason being cited is upcoming big releases in August. 
Anil Thadani (the films distributor), the producers and director Apoorva Lakhia realised that August was cluttered with too many releases. 
They realised that Haseena will have to compete with two biggies that are releasing in the weeks before  Shah Rukh Khans Jab Harry Met Sejal (August 4) and Akshay Kumars Toilet: Ek Prem Katha (August 11). 
What makes it worse is that besides Haseena Parkar, there are three releases lined up for August 18  Bareilly Ki Barfi, Newton and Partition 1947, it quoted a source as saying.The Apoorva Lakhia directed film also stars Rajesh Tailang, Ankur Bhatia and Sunil Upadhyay.
