Born of humble parentage - a Kannadiga from Bijapur district - Modi threw away a lucrative career in private practice after attending Gandhiji's historic prayer meeting at Bombay on August 8, 1942 where the Quit India resolution was passed. 
This tragic fact of rural India spurred Modi to pioneer the concept of mass eye camps.In an assembly line fashion, Modi operates 40 patients an hour, attending to four patients at a time.
