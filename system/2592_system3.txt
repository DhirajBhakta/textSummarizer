 Come July 15, no e-attendance would mean no salary for officials from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). 
Civic officials said of the 1.07 lakh employees in BMC, almost 70,000 have been brought under the biometric attendance, the rest will also be incorporated by July 15. 
The tough stance is against employees who benefit from administrative leniency and skip work by just signing on the register. 
Sudhir Naik, deputy municipal commissioner of the general administration department in BMC, confirmed the development. 
The organisation is undergoing a structural revamp by changing official duty hours and being stricter about attendance. 
The BMC recently did away with its British-era regime of spending close to 10 to 11 hours in office where officials would take routine breaks.
