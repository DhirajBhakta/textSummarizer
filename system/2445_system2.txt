PATNA: A poor mason with just four LED bulbs, a TV and a ceiling fan in a one-room house in Bihars Samastipur district, was served an energy bill of Rs 13 lakh, only to be corrected to Rs 2,992 after the power firm realised its folly on Thursday.Having received the bill in March, Manoj Kumar had struggled to get it rectified till the media got a whiff of it.
