The court was hearing a petition filed by Dhoni seeking initiation of contempt proceedings against the companys CMD Ajjay Agarwal for defying its November 17, 2014 direction asking Maxx Mobilink to "refrain from selling any products" which uses the name of the cricketer in commercials. 
The court had also passed a similar order on April 21 last year asking Agarwal to inform about the steps taken to comply with the 2014 direction asking the firm to refrain from selling any product, claiming to be endorsed by Dhoni.
