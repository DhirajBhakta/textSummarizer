The Delhi government has released Rs100 crore for the Signature Bridge project, which was hit by a fund crunch slowing down its last phase of construction.Delhi tourism minister Rajendra Gautam said, on Monday, that the finance department has sanctioned the amount after examining the contractors demand for an additional Rs250 crore. 
For the construction of the bridge, which was supposed to be ready for the 2010 Commonwealth Games, a budget of Rs1,131 crore was sanctioned but till now Rs1,575 crore have been spent. 
This bridge was conceptualised by the Sheila Dikshit government in 2004. 
Gautam, who had inspected the bridge earlier, had written to the chief secretary, saying that the work should not go on beyond December 31, this year, under any circumstances.This fresh infusion of funds will ensure that work, which had considerably slowed down, resumes. 
Around 92% of the project is completed. 
We might release more depending on the justification of the demand, he said.Located over the Yamuna in Wazirabad, this bridge with a bow-shaped steel pylon of the bridge will be twice as high as the Qutub Minar. 
Being built on the lines of the London Bridge, it was meant to be showcased during the 2010 Commonwealth Games. 
In January, lieutenant governor Anil Baijal had directed the authorities concerned to send to him a monthly progress report of the project.
