Steps and railings will make the beach accessible for senior citizens, said an official.
?While activists were unhappy with the plan to set up multi-coloured lights on the beach, they appreciated the BMC's effort to make the beach more accessible. 
Redeveloping the entrances is a good move but any beautification should not take away the natural feel of the beach, said Ashoke Pandit, convener, NGO Save Open Spaces.
