Green activists say that the trees to be felled are mostly more than 60 years old.Tree activist Radhika Bhagat, who has started the petition on change.org, says it is a plea to the Union ministry of environment, forests and climate change, Delhi chief minister, environment and forest minister, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the state level Environment Impact Assessment Authority and India Trade Promotion Organization (ITPO) to stall the felling of trees.This petition is helping bring social recognition on the Pragati Maidan tree cutting issue.
