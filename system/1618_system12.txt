Days after the Supreme Court sacked Board of Control of Cricket in India (BCCI) secretary Ajay Shirke, it has emerged that the Pune-based administrator made several phone calls to England and Wales Cricket Board's (ECB) president Giles Clarke telling him that the limited-overs series could be in jeopardy. 
Can you please confirm to me that the England team will continue to be looked after by the BCCI in the usual fashion, with proper security, player daily allowance payments, hotel bills covered and the like, with transport organised at all times"Obviously it is entirely a matter for BCCI where matches are played,but please advise soonest that the schedule will be adhered to, or any changes," Clarke wrote in the mail.Johri replied to Clarke the same day and assured to him that the series would go ahead as planned.
