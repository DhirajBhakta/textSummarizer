 Health services were crippled at the district hospital in Sector 30 for four hours on Monday as contractual doctors and paramedical staff went on a strike and protested against the hospital administration for not paying them salaries for the last three months. 
The wages of the contractual staff are provided by the Noida authority, which are later disbursed by the hospital administration.
