Javed Miandad has blamed foreign coaches employed by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) for bringing the national team on the brink of disaster.He also lashed out at the PCB's announcement that it would hold a two-day round table conference in Lahore in March with leading former captains and stalwarts to discuss and find solutions to Pakistan's cricket problems."
So what is the purpose of now consulting local players," he said.Miandad, who also remained coach of the Pakistan team thrice in 1999, 2000 and 2003/04 after an illustrious career spanning 124 Tests and 233 one-day internationals felt the conference is being called just to fool the angry and upset fans and critics."
