In defense of his father and former television head honcho Peter Mukerjea, Rahul Mukerjea, a prime witness of the case today wrote an open letter defending his father again.Tweeting the letter, Rahul reiterated that his dad believed every word his wife told him.Although this is not the first time he has come out in his father's defense while putting the entire blame of Sheena's murder in 2012 on Indrani, the timing of this longish letter assumes importance.The charges against Peter, Indrani and her ex-husband Sanjeev Khanna were filed this month.
