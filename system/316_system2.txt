The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Thursday again alleged that the Delhi police was filing ?
The cases, they said, were failing to stand under the court?
Still the police invoked section 354 (molestation) deliberately, which was later struck down by the court while granting anticipatory bail to Prakash Jarwal,? 
The AAP leader argued that the police in the past have repeatedly invoked ?
in complaints against other AAP legislators as well, and the cases could not stand court scrutiny. 
The complaint to the police for registration of FIR says that the accused touched the dupatta of the complainant and had a scuffle with her. 
The complaint itself suggests that the applicant came to the house of the complainant along with 40-50 other persons and started threatening her and her husband and in these facts it is very difficult to assume that the applicant had any intention to outrage the modesty of complainant or had any lust in his mind,?
