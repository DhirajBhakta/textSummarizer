From Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Lil Champs to The Voice, Sabse Bada Kalakaar to Junior Masterchef India and Super Dancer, reality shows featuring children are a common feature on Indian television.Last week, filmmaker Shoojit Sircar, known for films like Piku, Pink and Madras Caf?, tweeted that authorities should ban reality television shows for children. 
Other voices joined the debate, including filmmaker Amol Gupte, who worked with child artistes in Taare Zameen Par, and protested against the long working hours and exploitative conditions.Humble request to authorities to urgently ban all reality shows involving children.it's actually destroying them emotionally & their purity.? 
For Shekhar Ravjiani, one half of the music composer duo Vishal-Shekar, and a judge on Indian Idol Junior Season one (2013) and The Voice India Kids (2016), singing show Sa Re Ga Ma Pa back in 1997 was his first break.
