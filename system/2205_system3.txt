My production of Seeta Bagri was extremely well perceived and people in Pakistan supported its message of tolerance and brotherhood.How did you decide to work in Mom And was it difficult to shoot for the film with growing political hostilities between the two countriesOnce I got the offer, I couldnt resist myself from saying yes since, I knew, I would be playing a role against Sridevi and I was also aware that Sajal Aly from Pakistan, who is a beautiful actor, is part of the cast.
