Sofi had on April 20 reported to the chief warden of his hostel that someone had written objectionable comments on the door of his hostel room. 
The Chief Warden got in touch with the Associate Dean, Students' Welfare and they inquired the matter from the hostel Superintendent and the Warden, got in touch with the Chief Security Officer and called a meeting of all the people.
