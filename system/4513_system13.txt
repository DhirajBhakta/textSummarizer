At least 400 Indian languages are at the risk of dying in coming 50 years," GN Devy, the chairman of PSLI, said.Each time a language is lost, the corresponding culture is killed, Devy said, adding that India had already lost 250 languages in last five decades.The group of scholars and teachers at PSLI documents Indian regional languages in order to conserve cultural heritage and diversity.Most at risk are marginal tribal communities whose children receive no education or, if they do go to school, are taught in one of India's 22 officially recognised languages."
