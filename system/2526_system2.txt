Are you upset with the cleanliness of public toilets in Delhi? 
s three civic agencies will launch a mobile app, which will help users give a feedback about the toilet?
MCD officials said once they receive a feedback, teams will be sent to check the public utilities and they would inform private concessionaires managing the toilet.
