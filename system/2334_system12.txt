During much of the groups 53 years as an armed insurgency, it financed its fight through the drug trade.Former combatants have committed to work with the government to convince farmers to replace coca crops with another way to make a living.The history of drug crops is divided in two: before and after the beginning of the post-conflict period, said Enrique Gil Botero, the justice minister.Already 40% of the goal of forced eradication has been met, and 86,000 families  who account for as much as 76,000 hectares of coca  have signed on to crop substitution programs in exchange for subsidies of about $11,000 per farmer over the course of two years, according to the government.Having the Farc on the side of substitution and not on the other side makes a difference, said Rodrigo Pardo, who heads the government agency in charge of implementing the peace agreement.But the deal on crop substitution with the Farc, announced before the final peace deal was finalized last year, also provided a perverse incentive for farmers to grow coca, knowing they would later be awarded subsidies.
