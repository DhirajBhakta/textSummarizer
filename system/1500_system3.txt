In 2016, Rishi Kapoor had confessed to The Quint that he bought his Filmfare Best Actor award for his 1973 film Bobby.Now, in a recent interview with India Today Television, Rishi Kapoor admitted that he paid Rs 30,000 to get the award.Yes, I bought a film award for RS 30,000 in 1973; I am ashamed of what I did but was young and rich! 
@chintskap tells me @IndiaToday tvRishi Kapoor's Bollywood debut as a male lead was in the 1973 film Bobby for which he received the Filmfare Award for Best Actor in 1974.So, hypothetically, if a Filmfare Best Actor can still be (is still being) bought today, it would cost around Rs 6.19 lakh.The new amount, adjusted to inflation, can be simply calculated using the CPI (Consumer Price Index), the variable officially used by the RBI (Reserve Bank of India) to measure inflation.The formula to calculate the inflated amount is:(Average Consumer Price Index in Year 1 (in this case, 1974) / Average Consumer Price Index in Year 2) x Rs 30,000 (money Rishi Kapoor claims to have paid for his Filmfare Best Actor award)ALSO READ: 10 interesting facts from Rishi Kapoor's autobiography Khullam Khulla: UncensoredALSO READ: Rishi revealing dad's affairs and 5 other times Chintuji shocked the worldALSO READ: Rishi Kapoor had tea with Dawood Ibrahim and was offered 'everything'ALSO WATCH: The divas who ruled the red carpet at Filmfare Awards 2017That Filmfare Awards, or for that matter any film award televised for entertainment, can be bought with money, has been a timeless conspiracy theory.It snowballed when this year, Manoj Bajpayee (Aligarh) and Akshay Kumar (Airlift) were not nominated for the Best Actor award at the 74th Filmfare Awards ceremony.
