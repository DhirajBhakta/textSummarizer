The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) proposes to hold the finals for classes 10 and 12 on same dates in two shifts, a move that will reduce the examination period and give teachers extra time to check answer-scripts more thoroughly.The new plan was designed after the board met principals of some of the top schools in New Delhi and its satellite cities. 
a senior board official said.The CBSE has drawn criticism for its evaluation system as several students complained of variation in marks after asking the board for a relook.The board said it took extra care to cut faults, but the possibility of human error cannot be ruled out in calculating the marks, putting them on answer-scripts and feeding them manually in computers.?
