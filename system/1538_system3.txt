National Award-winning filmmaker Vetrimaaran on Monday came out in support of jallikattu saying that before asking for a ban on the traditional and ancient bull-taming sport, people should think about banning crackers on Diwali and immersing Lord Ganesh idols in water during Ganesh Chaturthi which disturbs the eco-system."
The main reason why PETA and others want to put a ban on this traditional practice (jallikattu) is that they say it's cruelty to animals," said Vetrimaaran. 
If this is the priority to stop this practice, then I think they are misinformed; as every year, because of India's biggest festival, not just one breed called bulls, but every living creature is killed and lost... and that's Diwali. 
If they are really concerned about the eco-system, then they should know that every year so much of toxic material is dumped into the sea during Ganesh Chaturthi, so they should stop that," he added.ALSO READ: Kamal Haasan asks Tamils not to hurt Trisha over jallikattu ALSO READ: After Kamal Haasan, Rajinikanth backs jallikattuVetrimaaran went on to add that people are "just responding to what they see on some video clips, where someone is torturing the bulls"."
