A nine-year-old boys nude body, marked with deep cuts and possible burns, was found in a public park in south Delhis Pul Prahladpur on Tuesday.The boys family alleged that he was tortured before being murdered as there were burn marks on his body. 
They suspect that the killer had stubbed burning cigarettes on his body before killing him.Romil Baaniya, DCP (south-east), said he wanted to wait for the autopsy report to confirm if the boy was tortured or sexually abused before being murdered.The nature of the injuries on the body has led the boys family to allege that an object like a screw driver or an ice-prick was used to kill him.
