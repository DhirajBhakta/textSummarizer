A high-profile nursery school in Delhi landed in soup recently for organising a monkey dance for the entertainment of its students. 
The Cambridge Montessori Preschool in Ashoka Niketan, Anand Vihar, apparently fetched a madari to cheer its kids, and had to pay for it by removing its principal after Union Minister Maneka Gandhi intervened. 
It seems the principal didn't know it is illegal to hold monkey dance shows.
