By Prasoon Srivastava New Delhi, May 1 (PTI) In a new face-off, telecom operator Reliance Jio has alleged that Bharti Airtel is violating tariff rules by issuing misleading offers and arbitrarily discriminating among its own customers subscribing to the same plan. 
"However, the subscribers who do not satisfy Airtels dual criteria, will be provisioned only 50 MB data and post that, they will be charged the exorbitant data tariff of Rs 4,000 per GB," Jio said. 
Under the said plans, Airtel is offering unlimited local and STD calls along with 1 GB of mobile internet per day for 70 days to customers with 4G handsets and 4G SIM. 
Other Airtel customers availing these plans get only 50 MB of data usage per day for 35 days. 
Jio said that Airtel is offering these recharges "in a grossly discriminating basis by providing the headline data benefits of 1 GB data per day for 70 days only to the new subscribers holding a 4G handset in conjunction with a 4G compatible SIM card. 
"These allegations are nothing but a continuation of Reliance Jios standard ploy of blaming others for all its problems, including network deficiencies," the Airtel spokesperson said.
