When Sridevi said in an interview that she would be happier to see her elder daughter Jhanvi get married than act, she faced backlash as some people took it to mean that the actor was against her daughter having a career. 
Sridevi added, "It's very important to me that young girls understand that the end goal of their life is not to get married and have babies and they have every right to make something of themselves if they wish to. 
What I meant to say initially was that I would prefer if my daughters didn't lead the kind of hectic life that comes with this business and instead have a relatively stable and relaxed life.
