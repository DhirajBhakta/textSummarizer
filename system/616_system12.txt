Kolkata, Jul 23 (PTI) Central Board of Excise and Customs (CBEC), the nodal national agency for administering customs and GST, was unhappy with West Bengals introduction of e-way bill system without waiting for it being launched by the Centre across the country. 
We have urged the state to keep the procedure on hold until it is rolled out by the Centre and across the states," a CBEC official told PTI. 
The e-way bill system is creating problems to the trade for being a process working in isolation, he said.
