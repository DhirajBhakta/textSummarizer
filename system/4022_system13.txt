Mumbai, Mar 29 (PTI) Reversing its earlier order, the Reserve Bank today said the bank branches dealing in government businesses need not remain open on April 1 in view of the annual closing business. 
In its revised instructions issued today, RBI said, "On reconsideration, it has been decided that these branches need not be opened on April 1, 2017." 
In a letter to the Indian Banks Association, unions AIBEA and AIBOA today said the RBI issued the directive "very late, causing huge resentment" among bank employees.
