Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday launched BHIM-Aadhar pay app, that will allow people to make payments without using a smartphone. 
Instead, the app will enable payments through the fingerprint scanner, by authenticating the biometric details of a user with Aadhaar database. 
To enable the transactions through BHIM-Aadhar, merchants will have to purchase fingerprint scanners.With the implementation of the new system, all you will need is your fingerprint to make a payment. 
Using the Aadhaar number linked to your bank account, the payment for your purchase will be requested by the merchant but is finalised only when you keep your finger on the biometric machine connected to the app through the smartphone.
