Los Angeles, Jan 8 (PTI) In a bizarre incident, an American woman living near an airport thought a massive bird had splattered her car with droppings only to realise that it was a plane that had dumped human waste on her property. 
Bethany Bowker, from West Jordan, Utah, left to pick up her children from school when she noticed the foul-smelling feces scattered all over her driveway and her car. 
She quickly realised she was not dealing with fecal matter of the bird variety. 
Bowker believes it came from a commercial aircraft releasing the waste from the air at the wrong time. 
She lives in West Jordan south of Salt Lake International airport, and it is not uncommon for her to see dozens of airplanes fly over her house daily.
