t raise doubts on Jaya?
s death when he was CM: DMK.
In a scathing attack, DMK's working president MK Stalin alleged that former Tamil Nadu chief minister O Panneerselvam was using former chief minister J Jayalalithaa's name for gaining political mileage. 
Taking on Panneerselvam for criticising his demand that Jayalalithaa's name be removed from government schemes, Stalin said OPS had never raised doubts about the mystery behind the death of Jayalalithaa when he was chief minister. 
Stalin's remark demanding removal of Jayalalithaa's photo from government installations and her name from government funded public welfare schemes has stirred a new controversy in the state. 
Both VK Sasikala and O Panneerselvam camps have taken extreme offense to Stalin's statement.Stalin, still holding his stand claimed that it is illegal and unconstitutional to depict pictures of Jayalalithaa on government funded programs.
