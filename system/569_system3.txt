Actor-singer Suchitra Krishnamoorthi, who finds herself in an eye of a storm over her tweet about the "aggressive/ ear shattering call of azaan", defended herself saying she doesn't have a problem the call but just wants the "loud sound" to be dealt with. 
Krishnamoorthi raked up controversy on Sunday after posting an early-morning tweet that read, "came (sic) home at 4.45 am 2 (to) most aggressive/ ear shattering call of azaan. 
Some, like AIMIM MLA Waaris Pathan indulged in taking personal potshots, calling her a "cheap singer" who tweeted what she tweeted for "publicity." 
They should shut their mouth and stop dividing people," Azmi said while demanding action against Krishnamoorthi for her tweets.
