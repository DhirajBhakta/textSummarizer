Actor-singer Suchitra Krishnamoorthi, who finds herself in an eye of a storm over her tweet about the "aggressive/ ear shattering call of azaan", defended herself saying she doesn't have a problem the call but just wants the "loud sound" to be dealt with. 
Samajwadi Party leader Abu Azmi was even more personal in his attack, saying how "these type of women" have "made Indian culture a laughing stock". 
They should shut their mouth and stop dividing people," Azmi said while demanding action against Krishnamoorthi for her tweets. 
She also defended her tweet saying that she is not against the concept of azaan.
