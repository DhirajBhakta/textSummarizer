Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday launched BHIM-Aadhar pay app, that will allow people to make payments without using a smartphone. 
The app, which will be available for download to merchants across the country, will link your Aadhaar number and biometric fingerprint to complete a transaction. 
This will not only make cashless payment more prevalent but also possibly more easy and hassle-free.
