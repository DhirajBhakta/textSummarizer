The beautiful combination of the alcoholic beverage and the energy-boosting stimulant has been brought forth by Napa Valley's Molinari Private Reserve. 
So, how do they achieve the to-die-for combination According to Time.com, they've worked for over two years to perfect the combination of a house-made red wine and "carefully selected" coffee beans. 
The beans "relax" in the "artisan-crafted" wine to absorb its flavors, then get dried and hand-roasted, resulting in rich coffee with a blueberry note, according to Molinari.
