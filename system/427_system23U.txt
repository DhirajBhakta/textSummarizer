Wild haired with a bushy moustache and his tongue sticking out, the photograph revealing Albert Einstein as something of a prankster is one of the most recognisable images of the physicist. 
Now a signed and dated copy is about to be auctioned.Snapped by United Press International photographer Arthur Sasse as Einstein departed in the back of car following his 72nd birthday celebrations in 1951, the image shot into the public consciousness after publishers overcame their initial qualms and printed the jovial image.Even the Nobel laureate himself was amused at the photo, requesting cropped copies which he then signed and gave to friends.
