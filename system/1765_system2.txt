Fake accounts in the name of L-G Anil Baijal surfaced on Sunday and Monday, after an account was created by the L-G House on Sunday. 
We received several complaints and alerts from the general public about some fake Twitter accounts. 
Police said they would look into allegations that the fake account users had posed as L-G Baijal and tagged other politicians, including chief minister Arvind Kejriwal. 
Many Twitter users communicated with the fake handles, assuming them to be the real L-G. 
Police said two fake accounts have been closed since the matter was reported. 
On Saturday, former home secretary Baijal joined as the 20th L-G of Delhi after Najeeb Jung resigned.
