New Delhi, Jul 7 (PTI) US fast food chain McDonalds 43 outlets in the national capital operated without valid health licences for nearly three months from April 1, its estranged India partner Vikram Bakshi has alleged. 
Bakshi said: "In early March before the licences were to go for renewal, I have clearly stated that because of issues of food safety and because of us not actually providing quality and safe food to customers, I no longer intend to sign (to apply for renewal of) the licences."
