A Democratic congressman has become the first US lawmaker to formally file an article of impeachment against President Donald Trump, but the effort is likely to stall in the Republican-controlled Congress.Democrat Brad Sherman of California followed through on a threat he made last month to seek to remove the president from office, filing a four-page resolution aimed at impeaching Donald John Trump, President of the United States, for high crimes and misdemeanours.Sherman in a statement said Trumps apparent effort to quash a probe into his campaigns ties to Russia and an investigation of a senior aide amounted to obstruction of justice.Recent disclosures by Donald Trump Jr indicate that Trumps campaign was eager to receive assistance from Russia, Sherman said.
