Over time the sport will get better.I said a couple of years ago it had to get really bad, when theres nowhere else to go but up. 
But at some point the close net of people I was with said: Listen to us, Usain, I know it is hard but you need to get back training because Germaine would have wanted it  he was looking forward to coming to your last race and seeing you compete and finishing off your legacy.That really helped me get going again.
