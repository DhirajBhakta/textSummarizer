Mumbai motorists paid Rs10.4 crore as fine for traffic violations in the first five months of 2017. 
Of the 6.31 lakh cases filed, the most (1.92 lakh) were for not halting at pedestrian crossing, followed by flouting of parking norms (1.16 lakh). 
Parking norm violators, however, topped the fine collection chart with Rs2 crore till May. 
Last year, the authorities increased the penalty for parking-related offences to Rs200 from Rs100. 
We have to identify the problem. 
Even while manning the junction, we walk down the road to issue challans for parking in no-parking zones or double parking. 
The personnel at Worli traffic headquarters scan the live CCTV footage to identify violators across the city. 
The police deploy constables on bike at junctions where motorists are likely to flout rules.
