In a major drug bust, the Baramulla Police today seized 66.5 kilograms of suspected heroin worth Rs 300 crore from a truck that originated from Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.The truck was purportedly carrying boxes full of garments, but hidden among the boxes were packets of narcotics. 
Officials posted at the LoC Trade Centre in Salamabad, Uri, who were already on the lookout for such a truck after receiving intelligence inputs about the movement of drugs, stopped the lorry and carried out a search, which led to the recovery of the narcotics.The driver of the truck - a PoK man named Syed Yousuf - has been arrested, but officials believe he is just a small-time operative.
