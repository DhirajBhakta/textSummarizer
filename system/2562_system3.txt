 Having secured a Union government clearance to handover forest land for the proposed Navi Mumbai airport after much delay, the state government has formally set aside 250 hectares of forest land in Raigad district to the City and Industrial Development Corporation (Cidco) for the project.A delay in getting the forest land had held up crucial pre-development works for the Rs16,000-crore Navi Mumbai airport project. 
Verma, joint managing director at Cidco, said, In the absence of a clearance for the forest land, we had started basic surveys and soil investigations as part of the pre-development work.
