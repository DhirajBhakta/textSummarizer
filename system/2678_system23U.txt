Pakistan Cricket Board chief Shaharyar Khan has said India are scared of playing Pakistan after losing the Champions Trophy final at The Oval on June 18. 
India and Pakistan have not played bilateral cricket since 2012 when the latter travelled across the border for a short limited-overs tour. 
That was the only series between the arch-rivals since the 2008 terror attacks in Mumbai.However, the two countries have continued to play at ICC events with India enjoying a clear upper-hand.
