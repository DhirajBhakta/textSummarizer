The widow of an ace Air Force pilot, who died in a plane crash in service, had to wait over five decades after her husband's death to get the pension due to her, in an incident underscoring government apathy towards families of martyred soldiers.Kamla Lowe, now 95, was fighting for the special family pension, which is given to widows of officers and men who died in service while carrying out their duties. 
Despite the fact that the officer's widow is entitled to special family pension, the government in September 2004 rejected her appeal by giving an illogical reason that under the terms of deputation the applicant had already availed the benefits of insurance," Lowe's counsel Wing Commander Ajay Bhalla told Mail Today.Kamla Lowe also had to wait nine years for getting the ordinary pension and had to suffer a lot because of the lack of it, her husband's case revealed.The lady had also been fruitlessly writing letters to various authorities concerned to get her dues from the government.The government countered her by saying that she could not be given the special pension as her husband had opted for an insurance scheme before his death and also opposed the plea in the Armed Forces Tribunal, saying that she had come for justice after 55 years and her plea should dismissed on the basis of delay in approaching the court.The government also told the court that finding papers of the family pension granted to the widow of the officer and documents related to his deputation to HAL also could not be found as the matter was very old."
The chairperson in his order said the terms and conditions of that insurance (opted for by the martyred pilot) "are not before us"."
