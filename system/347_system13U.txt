We have also heard the stories of three decorated officers of the INA, Shah Nawaz Khan (Kunal Kapoor), Prem Sehgal (Mohit Marwah) and Gurbaksh Dhillon (Amit Sadh), and how they turned into the symbol of unity in diversity during a court case against the British government two years before the Indian independence. 
An Indian officer, Mohan Singh, was appointed the incharge of this troop, but later Subhash Chandra Bose (played by Kenny Basumatary) took control and gave birth to the INA.The actual film begins when trials start and the British regime decides to handle it with an iron fist.
