COAI Director General Rajan S Mathews said the Jios announcement is a bundled offer and the plan to sell it at an "effective zero price" is a "clever marketing position" as the move will help the company save licence fee and other government levies. 
In such cases, there will be dilution for Jio from customers paying Rs 303 moving to Rs 153," Mathews said.
