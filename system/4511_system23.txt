So, Secret Superstar is another film based on empowerment of the girl child, Aamir said here when asked about the message that Secret Superstar carries for the society.The actor was present at the trailer launch of the film on Wednesday.Aamir, a father of three, feels the Indian film industry must make more films for children.We should make more films for children. 
So it proved to be a challenge for me as an actor to make the audience believe in the character.Kiran, who has co-producer the film, also spoke about not wanting Aamir to play the role.I told him not to do this role as (I felt) he wont be able to do it.
