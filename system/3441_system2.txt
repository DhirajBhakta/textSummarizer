From Lalit K Jha Washington, May 6 (PTI) The standard of drinking water in India has improved in the last five years but a lot of work still remains to be done, the head of the World Water Council has said. 
As per the survey, more than one-third of Indians think that not enough is being done to achieve the UNs Sustainable Development Goals to make water and sanitation for all a reality by 2030, World Water Council president Benedito Braga said. 
"There has been some work done in the past five years to improve the drinking water standards in India. 
Braga said more than three quarters of the Asians were convinced that governments need to lead the fight to make global access to safe drinking water and sanitation reality. 
According to the survey, 31 per cent of Indians said they had been in a situation where it was unsafe to drink water but they had no other choice and suffered from diseases like diarrhoea and gastroenteritis. 
The survey stated that 62 per cent of the Indians said they believed that the government was doing enough to support access to safe drinking water. 
Referring to the Swachha Bharat Campaign, Braga praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his efforts towards clean drinking water and sanitation.
