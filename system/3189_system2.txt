By Shirish B Pradhan Kathmandu, May 30 (PTI) The pilot of a small cargo plane of the Nepal Army was killed and two crew members injured when the aircraft overshot the runway during an emergency landing in western Nepal today, the second accident involving a cargo aircraft in less than a week in the Himalayan nation. 
The injured have been admitted to a hospital. 
The plane was to land at the Simikot airport in Humla district. 
But, due to bad weather it was flown to Bajura where the pilot tried to force-land it resulting in the accident.
