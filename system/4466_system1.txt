New Delhi, Feb 26 (PTI) Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar will address two rallies in the national capital ahead of the municipal polls, where JD(U) will contest all the 272 seats, taking on the AAP on its home turf. 
The partys Delhi in-charge Sanjay Jha announced it an event where few district-level Aam Aadmi Party workers, mainly from east Delhi, joined JD(U), accusing the AAP of neglecting Poorvanchalis in MCD ticket distribution. 
He said the Poorvanchalis here have been "let down" by the Arvind Kejriwal government despite having extended every possible backing to it over the last two years. 
Jha brushed aside Kumars perceived closeness with Kejriwal, saying JD(U) will work for expanding its base and work towards ensuring "fair" representation of the Poorvanchali population.
