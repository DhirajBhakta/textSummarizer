The bungalow was allocated through a state cabinet decision of the Aam Aadmi Party last year.In an earlier communication to the government, L-G Anil Baijal had communicated to the government that he was within his right to cancel the allocation of the office as it had been usurped by violating the rules.In a note written to the Government which has challenged LG order Baijal has written that it is a clear case of conflict of interest as Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal is also the convenor of Aam Aadmi Party and hence action can be taken on that front as well.
