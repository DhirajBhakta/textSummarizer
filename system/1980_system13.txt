All the injured people were admitted to the hospital and are out of danger now.The last rites of the 66-year-old man turned into a disaster when Laxmidhar, Gouranga Sahu's son lit the pyre, sparking a fire to a nearby tree which was home to a swarm of bees.The spark compelled the honeybees to move out of the beehive and the bees attacked whoever they could find there, police said.
