Mumbai, Apr 16 (PTI) From "Tanu Weds Manu" to "Anaarkali Of Aarah", Swara Bhaskar has given many critically acclaimed performances but the actress says she still feels like an outsider in Bollywood as it is tough to make a mark in the industry so soon. 
"It is not easy for anyone to make a mark in this industry. 
I struggle each day to do the work that I am doing. 
It is extremely difficult, as difficult as it could be in any profession. 
"I dont think I have still made a mark for myself. 
Box office success in a way encourages good content, good cinema."
