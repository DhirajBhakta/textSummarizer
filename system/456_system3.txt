Unhappy with the compensation being offered, farmer leaders of Greater Noida have decided to start a campaign in Jewars villages asking other farmers not to give their land for the proposed airport project.Their opposition may impact the airport project for which the state government needs 5,000 hectares in around 40 villages along the Yamuna Expressway. 
The Yamuna Expressway industrial development authority (YEIDA) is likely to begin land acquisition as the Centre has given its nod for the project.We will not let the land acquisition take place for the airport project because the state government is cheating farmers by giving them only Rs3,500 per square metre (psm) for land. 
We are likely to start a campaign telling all villagers along the expressway not to give their land for the project until the UP government gives better compensation, said Ajaypal Sharma, district president, Bharatiya Kisan Union.The Greater Noida and Yamuna Expressway authorities are buying land from farmers through direct purchase for Rs3,000 to Rs5,000 psm. 
Direct purchase means that if a farmer is willing to sell land, the authority will buy it instead of acquiring it through the Land Acquisition Act, 2013.We dont acquire land through the act because it takes a long time to make land available. 
Procuring it through direct purchase is quicker and easier, said a YEIDA official.Farmers said that if the government tries to forcefully acquires the land, they will hold an agitation.If the UP government does not increase land compensation, we will agitate. 
What we can do if it wants to repeat the Bhatta Parsaul agitation We will educate farmers who give up land for the airport project and start a big protest soon as all farmer unions are together on this issue, said Sunil Fauji, a farmer leader.The state government gave Rs17,000 psm for land in Ghaziabad. 
Farmers are happy to give their land for the project and we hope there will be no problem, said Abhay Singh, the YEIDA-appointed for land acquisition for the project.
