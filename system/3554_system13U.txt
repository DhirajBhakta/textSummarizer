Rana Daggubati, who made his acting debut with the political drama Leader, won international acclaim after playing the eponymous character Bhallala Deva in SS Rajamouli's Baahubali: The Beginning. 
Speaking about his childhood, Rana said, "Should I tell you one thing, I am blind from my right eye. 
I see only from my left eye. 
The one you see is someone else's eye which was donated to me after his death.
