On the night of December 16, 2012, when a young woman was brutally gang raped by six men in a bus in and left to die, the moment was described as one that would change Delhi?
from 747 out of 2166 cases in 2014 to 645 out of 2199 in 2015.All this, in spite of a series of reforms put in place since 2012, and six fast-track courts set up to handle rape cases. 
Out of the 2199 rape cases last year, 295 cases were those of incest, friends and family friends were involved in 816 cases and neighbours in 345 cases.?
