The biggest take away of this election is that the popularity of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has increased from what it was in May 2014 but at the same time we can see that that there is no Opposition. 
These election results have shown that we have reached a position which the Congress had occupied for a long time after the Bangladesh war of liberation but at that time we were a strong Opposition and provided the glue around which all opposition parties stuck.
