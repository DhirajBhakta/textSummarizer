The government of Maharashtra on Monday announced it would provide appropriate security to filmmaker Madhur Bhandarkar in the wake of the criticism he has attracted for making his latest movie Indu Sarkar.The security has been provided after a scheduled press conference of Bhandarkar in Nagpur was cancelled when Congress activists did not allow him to come out of his hotel. 
In Pune too, the management of the hotel where the director had put up advised him not to go outside.On the charge that the film maligns the image of Indira Gandhi and other Congress leaders of the past, Bhandarkar said, I have not made the film to malign anyone.
