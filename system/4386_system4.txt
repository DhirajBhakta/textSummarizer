With the two Metro stations and a railway line and major traffic crossings within one km, the Public Works Department (PWD) wants to have the longest skywalk of the capital at ITO. 
It will connect offices and entry/exit points of Metro stations. 
PWD said one foot overbridge (FOB) should connect the footpath of Sikandra Road (towards Tilak Marg) to the parking lot near Pragati Maidan Metro station across Mathura Road. 
One ramp may also be provided for access to Tilak Marg footpath near Supreme Court.Read: Kejriwal says no more odd-even in Delhi, focus now on public transport system?
