Funny as it may sound, this temple is offering a pen set that can solve all life's problem for students in distress.A shabbily designed hand bill issued by the Kashthabhanjan Temple in Gujarat's Panchmahal district has gone viral on social media raising many eyebrows as well as triggering mirthful comments.Dushyant Bapuji, who identifies himself as a Hanuman sevak, has said in the handbill that this pen was made using the divinity acquired by performing a Hanuman Saraswati Yagya.Comments ranged from calling it farce to youth self-assured posts like, "brilliant, now play and have fun throughout the year and by Bapuji's pen for exams."
The handbill with all its loud typography also attempts to capitalise on the sentiments of parents by asking pertinent questions like - Do you want your child to pass his exams Are you worried that your child may lose a year due to poor results Do you wish your child passes his Class 8,9, SSC, HSC or College examsWell, the magic pen set, that is believed to relieve stress and push young prodigies to threshold of success, comes at a whopping price of Rs 1,900.The makers of the pen sets also assure a payback if the student fails his examination. 
"If your student does not pass his examinations even after using our pen set, then we will return the entire amount," read a note in Gujarati in the handbill. 
A note in the handbill also mentions a mobile number, exam receipt, a photocopy of hall ticket and copy of school/college ID as prerequisites to buy the pen set.Also read:CBSE Board Exam 2017 begins today: Mobile app launched to locate exam centreCBSE Class 10 Board Exam: Assessment scheme revised
