By Ashwini Shrivastava New Delhi, Jun 26 (PTI) The Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) can now probe allegations of corruption in private sector banks and against their employees. 
Vigilance Commissioner T M Bhasin told PTI the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has given the necessary approval to the CVC on this. 
The move comes after the Supreme Court last year ruled that the chairman, managing directors and other officers of a private bank could be seen as public servants when it came to the Prevention of Corruption (PC) Act, 1988.
