Houston, Dec 20 (PTI) Scientists have developed the first vaccine for chikungunya fever made from an insect-specific virus that does not have any effect on people, making it safe and effective. 
"This vaccine offers efficient, safe and affordable protection against chikungunya and builds the foundation for using viruses that only infect insects to develop vaccines against other insect-borne diseases," said Scott Weaver, professor at The University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston (UTMB) in the US. 
Live-attenuated vaccines that are made from weakened versions of a live pathogen typically offer rapid and durable immunity but reduced safety. 
There may be a risk of disease with both of these vaccine types, either from incomplete inactivation of the virus or from incomplete or unstable weakening of the live virus that is only recognised when rare vulnerable individuals develop disease.
