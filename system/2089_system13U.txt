We wrote to different states corporations such as Haryana, UP, HP and Andhra Pradesh for providing monkey catchers but failed to get any reply, said RBS Tyagi, director veterinary department, SDMC.According to him, there are multiple reasons responsible for existing shortage of workforce.The monkeys are protected under the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972. 
So ideally it should be the departments responsibility to catch the monkeys, said Tyagi.The SDMC claimed it shared the facts with the wildlife department and but didnt get any reply.
