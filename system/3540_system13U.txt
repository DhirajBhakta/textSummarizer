A group of men allegedly broke into the house of Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari and assaulted his staff shortly after midnight on Sunday in retaliation to a road rage dispute in central Delhi. 
According to Braja Kishore Singh, deputy commissioner of police (New Delhi), Tiwaris driver, while driving a Scorpio, allegedly hit the WagonR car while taking a turn towards the service lane some 10 metres before the MPs residence.
