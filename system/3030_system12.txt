Popular Punjabi singers Diljit Dosanjh and Kamal Grewal may find themselves in trouble for 'glorifying dog fights' in their latest album videos and songs.Animal rights activists have set up a page on Facebook called 'Exposing Animal Fights in India', whereby they have uploaded more than 100 secretly-captured videos of the 'canine blood sport.'
Breeds such as pittbulls, bull dogs, Indian mastiffs and other pedigree dogs are especially bred and trained to be ferocious to the point of being lethal and kill other dogs in wrestling-kind of rings.Alongside, the dog lovers have also uploaded a song each of Diljit Dosanjh called 'Pitbull' and Kamal Grewal's 'Sarkari Ban' where both seem to be promoting the illegal activity.While Dosanjh, who is himself seen handling pitbulls in the video, says, "Rakhe fight nu vi Pitbull chaar ni" (Have kept four pitbulls for fighting), Grewal in his song called 'Sarkari Ban' says, "Petbull'an da chalaya yaaran ne hai daur ni" (Friends have begun the trend of pitbull fighting)."
