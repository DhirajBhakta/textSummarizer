Ward number 220 of Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has perhaps turned out to be the most keenly contested seat between BJP and Shiv Sena anywhere in Maharashtra in the just-concluded civic elections. 
Atul Shah, the BJP candidate, was a former MLA contesting against Shiv Sena's Surendra Bagalkar. 
So it came as a shock that the MLA had lost the municipal corporation election.? After the counting was over, the Sena's Bagalkar was declared the winner. 
But that was not to be.Atul Shah challenged the result. 
He demanded recounting of votes.Recounting was done not once but for three times. 
And in all the three rounds, there was a tie between Shah and Bagalkar. 
They had garnered equal number of votes.Finally, it was decided that the winner should be decided by lottery. 
Chits were drawn.Lo and behold! 
Luck favoured BJP's Shah and he was declared winner.Shah was one of the biggest names contesting from BJP. 
It is now behind Shiv Sena by just two seats. 
Shiv Sena has bagged 84 of the total 227 seats. 
BJP's spectacular performance is being credited to Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis.
