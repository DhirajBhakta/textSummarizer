It takes guts to interrupt a wedding. 
But when the groom has been in love with you for the past six years, and he promised to have his happily-ever-after moment with you, it probably makes it just a bit easier.That's exactly why 21-year-old Archana tried to stop a wedding ceremony in Vikravandi in Tamil Nadu's Villupuram district, and insisted that the groom - Gopalakrishnan - tie the knot with her instead, a report in the Tamil daily Thina Thanthi said.When Gopalakrishnan's family asked her to leave, she staged a dharna protest right there at the venue, the report added.It's already sounds like a script ripped out from a Kollywood screenwriter's notebook, but there's more.The Vikravandi police got involved, and Gopalakrishnan confessed to being in a relationship with Archana and agreed to marry her, the report said.Archana certainly got what she wanted, but spare a thought for the poor woman who was left at the altar so theatrically!
As for Gopalakrishnan, all he seems to have suffered was a few hours of embarrassment. 
But some grooms in Bihar, who're kidnapped and forced to get married at gunpoint, aren't quite so lucky.
