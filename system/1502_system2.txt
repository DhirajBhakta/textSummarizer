The Congress party may have opposed jalikattu with its full force but today it stands a divided house. 
Even as party chief spokesman Randeep Surjewala walks a cautious line there are leaders like Digvijaya Singh who outrightly support it. 
Dr Singh didn't stop there but went on to "wish you all success in achieving your objective" of getting bull fight which is popularly known as jalikattu banned.This letter is in sync with the views expressed by many ministers in the UPA regime like Jairam Ramesh. 
A popular uprising along the Marina Beach of Chennai in demand of the sport that Tamils call an inherent part of their culture has forced many political parties to modulate their views. 
Congress' Chief Spokesman? Randeep Surjewala in a tweet put the onus on the centre and taking a neutral view much away from Manmohan Singh's militant opinion on jalikattu said, "Congress respects people of Tamil Nadu in preserving the culture & tradition of Jallikattu more so as adequate safety precautions is taken. 
And amid all these the letter bomb is surely going to put the grand old party in an even more uncomfortable spot.
