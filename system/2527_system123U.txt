Third set tie-break: Federer 1-3 Raonic* (*denotes server): Federer gets back one mini-break with a fine forehand down the line that Raonic cant handle at the net.
Tomas Berdych looks rather sheepish after, er, claiming his, er, third ever win over Novak Djokovic. 
Back on Centre Court, Milos Raonic has held and lost three break points in the eighth game of the third set.
