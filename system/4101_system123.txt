The Indian Medical Association (IMA) has called off doctor's strike in Maharashtra after a meeting with Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis.

Fadnavis told IMA representatives that more security has been provided in 16 hospitals since Thursday, and the government will make more arrangements in next 10 days.Fadnavis, who on Thursday appealed resident doctors to call off their strike, had said in the Assembly today that 'enough was enough' and that continuing the strike despite assurances was totally insensitive."
