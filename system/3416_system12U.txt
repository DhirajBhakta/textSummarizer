But seldom do we hear of laymen going out of their way for the country's jawans. 
Janardan Bhatt, an 84-year-old retired State Bank of India employee, is one such layman. 
Bhatt and his wife recently donated Rs 1 crore to the National Defence Fund.Bhatt, who hails from Gujarat's Bhavnagar, used his entire life savings to make the donation. 
The former SBI clerk was prompted to do his bit for the Indian Army after he saw reports of martyred jawans and the challenging conditions that soldiers fight in to combat terrorism.
