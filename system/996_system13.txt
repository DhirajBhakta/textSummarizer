It was once a thriving school with more than 50 students, but things changed a few years ago, Sanwarmal, the schools head teacher, told HT.The school, which was established in 1998 attracted children from the neighbouring villages. 
We even encourage the village elders to come and chat with us so that we are able to pass the time, Krishna Verma, who is the sole female teacher, said.A retired army man, Kashiram and a farmer, Ghanshyam Singh, are regular visitors.The teachers have approached the education department in Jaipur to shift them on deputation to other nearby schools where there is vacancy for Sanskrit teachers.
