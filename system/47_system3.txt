What the films success has done is that it has shown [the Censor Board] up, and what they thought about the film. 
This has been one of the most high-profile tussles between the Censor Board and film teams in recent memory.With Lipsticks release stalled for almost six months, director Alankrita Shrivastava and her team fought to get a clean chit, and finally received it from the Film Certification Appellate Tribunal, which asked for 16 cuts in the film. 
But the success of such films prove that no one is bothered about what the Censor Board or the doubters think about [these] films.Shah also criticises the Censor Board for being dictatorial.
