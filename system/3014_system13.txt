At 1 pm today, New Delhi's Jantar Mantar will witness a big birthday bash thrown by the right-wing group Hindu Sena in honour of United States President Donald Trump, or as they like to call him, the "Saviour of Humanity."
But, the invite does promise a photo exhibition, presumably on the life and times of President Trump.Also, if the Hindu Sena's Trump birthday celebration from last year is to be considered, there will be a decorative cake involved.
