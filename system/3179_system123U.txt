London, May 29 (PTI) Scientists are building the worlds first wind farm powered by giant kites in Britain that could generate enough electricity to run 5,500 homes. 
As many as twenty kites flying higher than Britains tallest building will work in pairs to generate electricity. 
Their movement will pull on a tether wrapped around a rotating drum on the ground linked to a generator.
