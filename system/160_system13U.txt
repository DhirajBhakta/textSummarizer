Pakistans opposition leader, Imran Khan, has called for a future of real democracy in the country, following the dismissal of Nawaz Sharif as prime minister over corruption charges.We are thankful to the judiciary because with their judgment, they brought us a new hope, Khan told a gathering of thousands of supporters on Sunday.The rally in Islamabad was a triumphant celebration for the heartthrob-cricketer-turned-populist-politician, who, since last year, has led a campaign to oust Sharif.Fridays ruling by Pakistans highest court disrupted what had otherwise looked like a smooth path to next years election for Sharifs PML-N party.Former oil minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi will most likely be approved as interim prime minister on Tuesday, at a special session in the 342-member parliament, where the ruling PML-N party holds a strong majority.Abbasi will hold the position for less than two months, until Shahbaz Sharif, younger brother of the ousted prime minister, is confirmed in parliament and can take over.Thousands of supporters from Khans Pakistan Tehreek-e Insaf (PTI) party congregated at Islamabads parade ground on Sunday for what had been termed a thanksgiving day, the latest of Khans signature rallies that have helped him drum up popular support.In front of flag-flying party cadres dressed in the red and green colours of PTI, among towers of loudspeakers blasting music, Khan likened Pakistans rulers to mafia who safeguard personal interests at any cost.When we decided to move against Nawaz in the Panama case, everyone said it was a mistake because in the past, the powerful and mighty ones have been protected.
