Struggling to find people willing to work as monkey catchers, the South Delhi Municipal Corporation has decided to hire them on contract. 
So far, SDMC pays Rs1,200 for catching and relocation of one monkey.?
For the past three years, the corporation has written letters to the state governments asking for help in procuring services of monkey catchers. ?
We wrote to different states corporations such as Haryana, UP, HP and Andhra Pradesh for providing monkey catchers but failed to get any reply,? 
SDMC will soon file an affidavit in the Delhi high court, asking that the responsibility of catching and relocating monkeys be shifted to the Delhi government?
Besides, the animal lovers also add to the problem by filing police complaints against corporations and monkey catchers when the simians are caught in ones and twos, not troops.?
