New Delhi, Jun 2 (PTI) Ahead of Raymonds AGM next week to consider sale of JK House to its promoters and extended family at throwaway prices, its CMD Gautam Hari Singhania today said his personal opinion would be to vote against the resolution. 
Last week, proxy advisory firm Institutional Investor Advisory Services (IiAS) had red-flagged the proposal saying Raymonds promoters and their extended family are trying to buy the premium property in Mumbai from the company at throwaway rates which will result in loss of over Rs 650 crore to the company and its shareholders. "...As a related party I am required to abstain from voting on this resolution.
