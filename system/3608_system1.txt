"The deep biosphere where the fossils were found represents a significant portion of the Earth, but we know very little about its biology and even less about its evolutionary history," said Stefan Bengtson of the Swedish Museum of Natural History in Sweden who led the research team. 
There is a "clear possibility" that they are the worlds oldest fossil fungi - twice as old as generally accepted in the fossil record, Bengtson was quoted as saying by the BBC News.
