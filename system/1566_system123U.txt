Washington, Jan 15 (PTI) At least 18 Democratic lawmakers have said they will boycott US President-elect Donald Trumps inauguration this week, after disclosure of Russias alleged meddling in the 2016 election and his rebuke of civil rights icon John Lewis, according to a media report today. 
Democratic Representative Lewis blasted Trump in an interview to a news channel, saying he would boycott the ceremony for the first time since he arrived in Congress in 1987 because he doesnt see Trump as a "legitimate" president in light of Russian interference, CNN reported.
