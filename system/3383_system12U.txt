The jailing of Jakartas Christian governor on blasphemy charges has sparked outrage from his supporters in Indonesia, rights organisations and the EU.On Tuesday, a court in the capital of the worlds largest Muslim-majority country found Basuki Tjahaja Purnama  better known by his nickname Ahok  guilty of blasphemy, sentencing him to two years in prison.The EU has consistently stated that laws that criminalise blasphemy when applied in a discriminatory manner can have a serious inhibiting effect on freedom of expression and on freedom of religion or belief, the EU delegation to Indonesia and Brunei Darussalam said in a statement posted on its website.
