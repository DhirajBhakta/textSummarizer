India on Thursday snubbed Chinas offer to mediate to resolve the Kashmir issue, saying New Delhi was willing to hold negotiations with Islamabad.The external affairs ministry maintained that cross-border terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir was at the heart of the matter as it threatened peace and stability in the region.The ministrys strong reaction to Beijing came a day after its foreign ministry put out Chinas offer to play a constructive role in improving the Indo-Pak ties, especially after the increased hostility along the Line of Control (LoC).We have been ready to have dialogues with Pakistan in a bilateral framework. 
That position of addressing all issues, including the Kashmir issue, in a bilateral framework has not changed, MEA spokesperson Gopal Baglay told reporters.
(But) at the heart of the matter is really the issue of cross-border terrorism perpetrated on India, including on the people of Jammu and Kashmir. 
So, the matter is that cross-border terrorism in our region emanating from a particular source is threatening peace and stability not only in India but in other neighbouring countries, he said.Baglay also rejected allegations by Pakistan that India was using chemical weapons in Kashmir, saying the country is against the use of chemical weapon anywhere by anyone in any situation.
