Mumbai Congress has come up with a unique way to protest against government's decision of demonetisation. 
About 50 Congress workers in Mumbai got a tattoo on their hand which reads "huamara pradhan mantri rishwatkhor hain." 
We wanted to question PM Modi on Saturday when he was on a visit to Mumbai about the allegations levelled against him by Rahul Gandhi, but police kept us under house arrest.
