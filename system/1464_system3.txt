Congratulations to Akshay Kumar's Jolly LLB 2 for joining the list of films to have offended people in this country.Advocate Ajaykumar S Waghmare has filed a petition at the Bombay High Court, asking that the word 'LLB' should be deleted from the Jolly LLB 2, the title of Akshay Kumar's upcoming film.According to a report in The Hindu, advocate Waghmare has stated in his petition that using the word LLB is a "deliberate attempt to malign the reputation of the Indian legal profession."
The film is scheduled to release on February 10.Jolly LLB 2 is the second Akshay film from 2017 after Toilet: Ek Prem Katha which has offended somebody.In November last year, a group of saints in Mathura objected to the shooting of Toilet: Ek Prem Katha as the film's content was allegedly hurting the sentiments of the people of two villages Nandgaon and Barsana, where the film was being shot.
