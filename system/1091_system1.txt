Mumbai, Feb 19 (PTI) Tech Mahindra sees the proposed merger of Vodafone and Idea as a "seismic" event that will impact the IT sector, but asserted that it will benefit from such a deal. 
Clearly, it means that certain part of the IT spend will either come down or get re-directed," Tech Mahindra MD and CEO CP Gurnani told PTI here over the weekend. 
"The reason it may not have any impact on us, as a matter of fact it will get better for us, because for both the companies our primary focus is on customer service management." 
Since I am working more on change and customer experience management, my pie should grow," Gurnani said.
