The Mumbai Police arrested two senior officers posted at the Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport for allegedly letting people pass through immigration without due process. 
Mumbai Police's Sahar unit made the arrest. 
According to police officials, they uncovered the racket after arresting a woman who was travelling to Vancouver, Canada under a fake name and passport. 
During interrogation, the woman provided information on the racket and named three men believed to be the masterminds. 
Mumbai police then arrested the three men - Gaurav Singh, Mukadam Gulam Ali and Mustakil Hussain. 
The three used to arrange the illegal passage of people out of the country. 
They would not check whether (the) passport is legal or not, all details are right or not." 
The officer said that senior airport officials have launched a separate inquiry into the matter. 
A senior officer said, "This is a very serious and dangerous incident. 
The security of the Mumbai international airport is on risk (sic). 
I am shocked."
