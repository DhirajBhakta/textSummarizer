The Indian batsmen cashed in on a flat track at the Galle International stadium and made the Sri Lankan bowlers toil hard throughout day 1 after winning the toss and opting to bat in the first Test on Wednesday.Centuries from opener Shikhar Dhawan (190) and Cheteshwar Pujara (144 not out) helped India reach 399/3 at stumps with Ajinkya Rahane also batting on 39.India rode on a 253-run second wicket effort between Dhawan and Pujara to surpass the highest ever first day's total of 351 runs in Sri Lanka.Later, Pujara and Rahane added another 113 runs for the fourth-wicket to take the visitors to their second ever highest opening day's total.Abhinav Mukund (12) and captain Virat Kohli (3) were the only two batsmen who failed to get going on a pitch which had no assistance whatsoever for the bowlers - pacers or spinners.As a result, India broke quite a few records during the day.
