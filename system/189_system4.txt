Ridhima Pandit, who shot to fame with the portrayal of a humanoid robot on TV show Bahu Hamari Rajni Kant, is sure that she will never do small roles in films. 
I am not getting any good offers, and frankly, I will never play crappy roles like [the] heroine?
She is currently seen in the comedy show The Drama Company,which stars comedians such as Krushna Abhishek, Sudesh Lahri, and Sanket Bhosale. 
Happy that she got a chance to explore the physical comedy space, Ridhima says, ?
Ridhima adds that she does not want to be a part of any saas-bahu shows. ?
Before Bahu Hamari..., I had rejected a lot of offers for such shows.
