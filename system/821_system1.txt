The film is a subdued conversation starter - let us talk about womens desires as well as their rights, let women open up about their dreams.Lipstick under my Burkha brings in a lot of issues - from dictates on womens clothing to forced sex in a marriage, it addresses all of them boldly. 
This is a bold film not because it talks of womens sexuality but because it draws attention to their desires and problems and does so in the most glaring colours.
