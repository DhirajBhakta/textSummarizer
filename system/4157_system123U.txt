Two Sufi clerics of the Hazrat Nizamuddin Dargah in Delhi, who had gone missing in Pakistan last week, blamed a Pakistani newspaper for publishing a misleading article that had led to their ordeal. 
The duo arrived at the Indira Gandhi International Airport on Monday and went to pay obeisance at the shrine where they spoke to media. 
Officials of home ministry met the two clerics after they returned to Delhi on Monday.
