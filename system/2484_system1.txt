Former Indian captain Sourav Ganguly on Saturday regretted taking off his shirt on the Lord's balcony after India's win in the NatWest triangular series in 2002 in England, calling it a mistake.When reminded of the incident, Ganguly said it was only a way of "relieving the pressure". 
But we were on the winning side," he said at Salaam Cricket Conclave 2014, a day-long event organised by the India Today Group in New Delhi.On being asked what has been his best mistake, Ganguly quipped, "When I got married." 
When asked if marriage is akin to captaining India since the first five years are tough, Ganguly quoted actor Shah Rukh Khan, "As SRK says, end mein sab theek ho jaata hai," bringing the house down.The former Indian skipper also said a resurgent Team India will not buckle pressure anymore.
