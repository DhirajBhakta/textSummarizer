The election commission (EC) has cleared Delhis deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia and party colleague Surinder Singh of allegations of holding an office of profit, a charge that could have disqualified them as legislators. 
The complaint against Sisodia and Aam Aadmi Party MLA Singh was forwarded to the poll panel by the presidents office but was found to be untenable, sources said.The poll panels findings have been sent to President Pranab Mukherjees office . 
Sources said the President has to accept the ECs recommendations.The decision comes at a time when the election commission is hearing a similar complaint against 21 AAP legislators, who were appointed parliamentary secretaries to assist various ministers of the Arvind Kejriwal government. 
The appointments were struck down by the Delhi high court.The poll panels decision, which can have a bearing on the stability of the government, is likely to be announced by May 15.BJP leader Vivek Garg wrote to Mukherjee, demanding Sisodias membership of the Delhi assembly be cancelled as there was no provision for the post of deputy chief minister in the NCT of Delhi act, which deals with government formation, assembly and other such subjects. 
Members of Parliament and state assemblies cant accept government positions that offer money or other benefit such as office space or even a car. 
A violation can lead to the disqualification of a lawmaker under the office of profit rules that are meant to ensure independence of legislature and guard legislators from executives inducements.Singh was accused of benefitting from his membership of the New Delhi Municipal Corporation by illegally occupying four government flats.Delhis ruling party has been at loggerheads with the poll panel. 
Rawat has recused himself from hearing all cases and complaints related to the AAP, saying it was important to protect ECs credibility.In 2006, Congress president Sonia Gandhi quit her Lok Sabha membership after the Opposition accused her of holding an office of profit when she was appointed the chairperson of the national advisory council, a body set up in 2004 to advise prime minister Manmohan Singh.
