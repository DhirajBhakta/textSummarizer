New Delhi, May 17 (PTI) Air travellers have voiced concerns over what they call lopsided measures in the no-fly list for unruly passengers and demanded airlines should also be held equally accountable for misbehaviour of their crew. 
"There have been a lot of feedback and concern from the public that while there are penal actions recommended against unruly passengers, how will misbehaviour on the part of airlines be dealt with," said a senior ministry official. 
The official said the governments intention is to have a balance, but added that those who gave feedback felt the draft rules were "tilted towards airlines". 
The first level of misdemeanor, which includes verbal harassment or physical gesture, carries a flying ban of three months. 
The second level comprises physically abusive behaviour and will carry a ban of six months.
