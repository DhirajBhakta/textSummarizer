Now, the corporation proposes to pay them a regular salary, even if they dont catch any monkey. 
Thats the last thing we can do to attract monkey catchers, said a senior SDMC official. 
For the past three years, the corporation has written letters to the state governments asking for help in procuring services of monkey catchers. 
Besides, the animal lovers also add to the problem by filing police complaints against corporations and monkey catchers when the simians are caught in ones and twos, not troops.Such an incident happened in Nizamuddin and our staff was harassed unnecessarily. 
In fact, it is a major reason why monkey catchers dont want to work in Delhi, said an official.
