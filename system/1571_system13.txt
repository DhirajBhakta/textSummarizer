The Middle East Airlines flight from Beirut was forced to make the emergency landing in Istanbuls Ataturk Airport after the argument broke out. 
Cabin crew rushed to break up the fight, but the man "violently" shoved one of them away and punched another, The Mirror reported. 
The planes captain then decided to make an emergency landing in Istanbul and the older man was dragged off the flight by four security guards.
