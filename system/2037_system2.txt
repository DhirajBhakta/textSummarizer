During the hearing, Advocate Shrinivas Patwardhan, representing the other district banks in Maharashtra, alleged the RBI had only released funds to the Sholapur bank while others in Thane and Nashik were left high and dry with no money to pay teachers' salaries.Dhond, however, countered the allegation and said, "Now nurses will say why only teachers are getting salaries. 
There is no cash in rural areas".Justice Oka advised the district banks to approach the district co-ordinators of the SBI.
