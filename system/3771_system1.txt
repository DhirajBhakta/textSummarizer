The video that was put on YouTube two days ago has since been shared widely on social media.All political parties and their leader should keep India first, says 47-year-old Vishwas, who is also a poet.If you form government in Delhi on an anti-corruption plank and fall silent when some of your own come under scanner, people have the right to question you, he says.Recently, some AAP leaders have been accused of corruption and nepotism by a panel that looked into a string of decisions taken by the Kejriwal government.The CBI is examining accusations of money laundering against Delhi health minister Satyendra Jain.In his India first message, Vishwas also questions the personality cult and goes on to draw a parallel between Narendra Modi, Rahul Gandhi, Arvind Kejriwal and Yogi Adityanath.Whether it is Modi, Rahul, Yogi or Kejriwal...it is about five years, 10 years or 25 years.
