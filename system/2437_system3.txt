 Of all the rules at Wimbledon  and there are many  surely none is more outdated than one referring to players clothing. 
Yesterday I wore black pants and nobody said anything and today I wore blue and suddenly its a problem, he said. 
Rodionov said Wimbledon provided him with two white pairs. 
One was a little bit too big but these ones were OK, he said. 
Asked if the rule was outdated, he said: Wimbledon is always special. 
Maybe its a little bit too much but I like that the players only have to wear white. 
At the same time the nine-times champion Martina Navratilova, wearing a hat, was chased down the street outside Wimbledon by two people who had not fallen for the (slim) disguise.
