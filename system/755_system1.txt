A 10-year boy has accidentally discovered a rare, mostly intact 1.2 million year-old skull of stegomastodon - a prehistoric ancestor of elephants - while hiking in the Las Cruces desert in the US.?
I was running farther up and I tripped on part of the tusk,? 
said Jude Sparks, who had been hiking in the desert with his parents.?
My face landed next to the bottom jaw. 
I looked farther up and there was another tusk,? 
said Sparks.The Sparks family contacted Peter Houde, a professor at the New Mexico State University (NMSU) in the US.?
A stegomastodon would look to any of us like an elephant,?
