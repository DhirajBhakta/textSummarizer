Private law colleges in Maharashtra have been allowed to hike their fees for the first time in nine years.Fees for both three-year and five-year LLB courses are being revised by the Fee Regulating Authority (FRA). 
However, after the state categorised law programmes as professional courses, they were brought under the FRAs ambit, making them eligible for fee revision.The law colleges were brought under the FRAs control, as the universities dont have a mechanism to monitor the finances of individual colleges.
