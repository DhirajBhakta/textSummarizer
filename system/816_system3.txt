Despite the four votes from the BJP that went to Kovind, the former governor of Bihar who won with a landslide victory in the Presidential elections on Thursday, got a total of six votes --- which means that two AAP MLAs had cross-voted. 
While we know for sure Kapil Mishra voted for Kovind, the other one must be some suspended MLA only, said Saurabh Bhardwaj, AAP spokesperson and MLA from Greater Kailash.
