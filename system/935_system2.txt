A Somerset cheesemaker has offered a ?500 reward after two of its finest vintage cheddars were stolen during a prestigious show. 
The cheesemakers at Wyke Farms in Bruton, Somerset, were devastated that two of the best blocks they had ever produced have vanished. 
Rich Clothier, a third generation cheesemaker and the managing director of Wyke Farms, said he believed the thieves had targeted the prize-winning cheddars and may have been stealing to order.
