It appears that they are worried more about the RK Nagar bypolls as the party's deputy general secretary TTV Dinakaran is contesting from the constituency.Irked by the state government's attitude, Stalin said, "The state government is worried more on how to distribute money to gain votes for the RK Nagar polls than about the farmers' protest in Delhi."
He is only concerned about segregating votes for a Foreign Exchange Regulation Act (FERA) convict in RK Nagar," Stalin said.Many even questioned how the ministers of the state had time to stay in Delhi to attain the twin leaf symbol but couldn't take time out to meet the farmers.
