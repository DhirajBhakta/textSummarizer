A visit to The Wine Company at DLF Cyber Hub, Gurgaon, turned foul for three young men, who now claim they were brutally thrashed by the bouncers here for no good reason.Suryansh Jalan wrote a review on Zomato saying that three of his friends had gone to The Wine Company on Monday night at around 10pm. 
From here, as Jalan claims, things started going south: "Seems like there was a misconception in the company staff, as the Manager tried to stop one of the friends by grabbing their arm, and when the individual tried to release himself from the strong grip of the Manager, around 8-10 highly aggressive, seemingly uneducated and brutish bouncers, decide to take matters into their own hands, and viciously jumped them NOT with the intent to restrict them, but rather to cause heavy and grievous harm."
