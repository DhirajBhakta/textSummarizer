The Indian Army, after consultations with the Defence Ministry, is considering cutting down the numbers of its sahayaks or 'buddies' by 25 percent. 
This would translate to around 10,000 jawans as there are currently about 40,000 sahayaks in the Indian Army. 
The move would come in the wake of the controversy over the tasks Indian Army sahayaks perform for officers and junior commissioned officers.Under the army's 'buddy's system, sahayak jawans are attached to officers and junior commissioned officers. 
The Indian Navy and the Indian Air Force do not have such a system in place.The age-old system recently came into the spotlight after a few jawans posted grievance-filled videos on social media.
