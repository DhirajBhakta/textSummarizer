Hearing a petition filed by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), the top court said it was ready for day-to-day hearing in the case after the central investigation agency pleaded the court that conspiracy charges against top BJP leaders, including Advani, Joshi, Union Minister Uma Bharti be revived. 
Senior advocate K K Venugopal, appearing for the BJP leaders, told the Supreme Court that his clients were ready to face conspiracy charges if the CBI can adduce evidence against them in Raebareli. 
"Why should my right to appeal be taken to a sessions court," Venugopal said. 
The CBI had booked several BJP leaders including Advani, Joshi, Uma Bharti, Kalyan Singh and Vinay Katiyar but they were freed by a court in Raebareli of conspiracy charges.
