Amid a heightened security threat, the Delhi airport security has new Explosive Trace Detectors (ETD) that can trace if any item in the bag was in contact with any explosive in the past 24 hours. 
While our staff is highly trained, through better use of technology we try to minimise terror-related incident, said an official of the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF).Officials said there will be some trace of the explosive on a persons hand if he has touched it before coming to the airport.
