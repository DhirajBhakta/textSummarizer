So she took to Twitter to vent her grievances against what she called a 'disappointment'.Now that every other individual in distress is making it a point to reach out to Sushma Swaraj, Lilly too followed the same, directing a series of tweets at the foreign minister and Prime Minister, Narendra Modi.Love india but gotta say that the consulate of India in Toronto is literally the worst place on earth. 
Such a disappointment.For travel to India, the consulate makes acquiring a visa the most difficult task. 
@SushmaSwaraj just a kind note to make you aware that the Consulate of India in Toronto is extremely difficult and unprofessional. ????
