They starred in the British-made sci-fi series Space: 1999 from 1975 to 1977.Academy award winning actor Martin Landau sits on his new star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, as he poses for photographers during ceremonies to honour him, in Hollywood, December 17, 2001.
Instead, he chose Mission: Impossible, and Leonard Nimoy went on to everlasting fame as Spock.Ironically, Nimoy replaced Landau on Mission: Impossible.After a brief but impressive Broadway career, Landau had made an auspicious film debut in the late 1950s, playing a soldier in Pork Chop Hill and a villain in the Alfred Hitchcock classic North By Northwest.He enjoyed far less success after Mission: Impossible, however, finding he had been typecast as Rollin Hand, the top-secret mission teams disguise wizard. 
His film career languished for more than a decade, reaching its nadir with his appearance in the 1981 TV movie The Harlem Globetrotters on Gilligans Island.Actor Martin Landau holds the Screen Actors Guild Award he won for outstanding performance by a male actor in a supporting role for his role in the film Ed Wood at the first-ever televised awards show for the organization in Los Angeles.
						He began to find redemption with a sympathetic role in Tucker: The Man and his Dream, the 1988 Francis Ford Coppola film that garnered Landau his first Oscar nomination.He was nominated again the next year for his turn as the adulterous husband in Woody Allens Crimes and Misdemeanors.His third nomination was for Ed Wood, director Tim Burtons affectionate tribute to a man widely viewed as the worst Hollywood filmmaker of all time.There was a 10-year period when everything I did was bad. 
Id like to go back and turn all those films into guitar picks, Landau said after accepting his Oscar.In Ed Wood, he portrayed Lugosi during his final years, when the Hungarian-born actor who had become famous as Count Dracula was ill, addicted to drugs and forced to make films with Ed Wood just to pay his bills. 
Despite the trash, he had a certain dignity about him, whatever the role.So did the New York-born Landau, who had studied drawing at the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn and worked for a time as a New York Daily News cartoonist before switching careers at age 22.He had dabbled in acting before the switch, making his stage debut in 1951 at a Maine summer theatre in Detective Story and off-Broadway in First Love.In 1955, he was among hundreds who applied to study at the prestigious Actors Studio and one of only two selected.
