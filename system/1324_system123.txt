It was the second major honour of his career, following on from the League Cup triumph in February of that year and Lampard would go on to claim 11 of them  all with his beloved Chelsea, the club he joined from West Ham United in 2001. 
He never got to play for England schoolboys and I can remember Harry Redknapp, the West Ham manager, asking me why Frank wasnt playing for England youth, when he was a youth-team player at the club.Harry rang the England coach, who was Dave Burnside, and Dave said: We know about him but we think weve got better.
