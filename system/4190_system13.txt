Aptly called WOW-Fi, the service offers a top speed of up to 100 megabits per second (mbps), about ten times faster than what many internet users would get at home in the UAE. 
The launch of the service follows Dubai Airports launch of an upgraded free unlimited high-speed Wi-Fi connection across Dubai International (DXB) and Dubai World Central (DWC) in December last year.
