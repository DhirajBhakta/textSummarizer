About 24 miles (38 km) of the border in Arizona is marked by the Colorado river.Trump also said the wall needs transparency.You have to be able to see through it, Trump said, adding that border agents need to know what or who is on the other side of the fence to avoid being hit by sacks of drugs and other contraband.As horrible as it sounds, when they throw the large sacks of drugs over, and if you have people on the other side of the wall, you dont see them.
