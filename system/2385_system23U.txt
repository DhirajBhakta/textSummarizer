Donald Trump doesnt see the need for a proposed border wall to stretch the length of the roughly 2,000-mile (3,218 km) frontier with Mexico.Instead, he envisions anywhere from 700 (1,126 km) to 900 miles (1,448 km) of see-through wall.Trumps comments on the wall are the most definitive description he has given on what became a primary campaign promise. 
During the campaign he vowed to oversee construction of a big beautiful wall, with a big beautiful door to let approved immigrants come into the United States.But on his way to Paris, Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One: Its a 2,000-mile border, but you dont need 2,000 miles of wall because you have a lot of natural barriers.
