The woman, identified as Sonam, was shot dead at point blank range by her sister Shazia using a country made pistol at their home on December 14. 
Both Shazia and Sonam were divorced.On Monday, the northeast district police arrested 21-year-old Shazia and recovered the weapon of offence, even as she tried convincing the police that her sister was killed by her stalker who had been harassing her for the past some months. 
Police said Shazia cooked up the stalking story to mislead the probe.A senior police officer said that during the questioning, Shazia disclosed the alleged involvement of her boyfriend Waseem. 
She said that he gave her the idea of killing Sonam. 
AK Single, deputy commissioner of police (northeast), said that last week, Shazia and Sonam entered into an argument over this. ?
