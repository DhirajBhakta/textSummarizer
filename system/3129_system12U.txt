Ever since the trailer of Salman Khan's Tubelight released, a lot has been said about how the film would probably break Baahubali 2's records at the box office. 
He told IANS, "I want Tubelight to break records of Baahubali and become a superhit film. 
In an interview to Firstpost, the Bajrangi Bhaijaan actor said, "I doubt that Tubelight will break Baahubali 2's record, because the latter is one of the most freakish films that has been made.
