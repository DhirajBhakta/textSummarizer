"On the occasion of the Spring Festival, I wish all the people of China a happy and prosperous Year of the Rooster," Modi said in his greeting posted on his Chinese social media platform, Weibo. 
Chinese lunar calendar years are grouped into a 12-year cycle, with each year assigned an animal symbol: rat, ox, tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, sheep, monkey, rooster, dog and pig. 
The Prime Minister opened an account in Weibo, a twitter like social media platform which is very popular in China during his visit here in 2015 and continued to make use of it to interact with Chinese people.
