 A day after the district administration and the police, in a joint operation, seized illegally mined sand from two villages of Sikandarpur and Murshadpur, the district magistrate said he was planning to start night patrolling on the floodplains of river Yamuna to curb sand mining. 
If the administration wants to stop sand mining, it should ensure that the police stop supporting the sand mafia, said Tikam Singh, a resident of Nagli village.
