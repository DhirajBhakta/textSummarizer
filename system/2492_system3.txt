The Bombay high court struck down criminal proceedings against a 20-year-old who was held for allegedly stalking and sexually harassing a woman, after he promised to clean, sweep and mop Padmavati Balkashram ? 
a children?
s home at Mohol in Solapur ? 
every Sunday for the next three months.The bench said it took?
Dnyneshwar Pawar?
s age and willingness to perform community service into consideration while granting him conditional relief. 
s career, especially as he and the woman had settled the matter amicably.?
Keeping the FIR alive has no purpose. 
It will only burden criminal courts, which are currently overburdened,? 
they added.?
Continuing the case will only amount to abuse of the court?
s processes and it is thus necessary to quash the FIR to secure justice,? 
said the bench.The bench said that if Pawar failed to produce a certificate issued by head of Padmavati Balkashram within four months, proceedings against him will restart.
