Lauding the NDA government for coordinated efforts of the Prime Ministers Office with various ministries and departments on the Housing for All by 2022 mission, Parekh said this has been one of the main promises made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and several steps have been taken, especially this year, to achieve this goal. 
Speaking in detail about various schemes and measures, Parekh said the government has extended the 100 per cent tax deduction scheme for affordable housing projects approved between June 2016 and March 2019, by two more years till 2021. 
Parekh also said that a clear carpet area definition has been put in place for affordable housing units -- 30 sq meters in four metros and 60 square meters for rest of the country. 
The business leader said the infrastructure status to affordable housing is another major benefit that builders have been given by the government and this will help lenders too.
