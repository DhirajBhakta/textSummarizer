A five-year-old girl was left in tears after being fined ?150 for running a stall selling cups of homemade lemonade to passersby.The schoolgirl was accused of trading without a licence by a council enforcement officer last Saturday, her father, Andre Spicer, said. 
It was a way to entertain her on a summers day. 
We set up the stand and people started buying the lemonade. 
They were on the way to a concert and she brought a smile to their faces, he said.But he said that, after about half an hour, an enforcement official approached them and immediately launched into a legalistic script. 
But the academic, who has also written for the Guardian, said it was one thing for someone in such a privileged position as his to be able to fight back  and quite another for someone without such a platform.If there are other people who have been fined in a similar way, then this is kind of worrying. 
We are shooting down opportunities for kids to learn, he said.A Tower Hamlets council spokesperson said: We are very sorry that this has happened. 
We expect our enforcement officers to show common sense, and to use their powers sensibly. 
This clearly did not happen.The fine will be cancelled immediately and we have contacted Prof Spicer and his daughter to apologise.
