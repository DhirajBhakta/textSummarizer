The Delhi Assembly on Tuesday adopted a resolution directing the AAP government to constitute a fact-finding committee to probe the financial condition of cash-strapped East and North MCDs. 
The development comes in the backdrop of the recent strike by the municipal staff of the east MCD over non-payment of salaries and the political slugfest over the issue. 
While the Delhi government accused the BJP-led municipal corporations of becoming the den of corruption, the political leadership in the BJP ruled civic bodies alleged that the AAP government deliberately stalled disbursal of due funds.
