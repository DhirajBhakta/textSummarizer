If Salman Khan indulged in some daredevil stunts in the 2012 film Ek Tha Tiger, Katrina Kaif is set to give him some serious competition in the sequel. 
With the next schedule of Tiger Zinda Hai to begin soon, Katrina is busy training hard for high-octane action sequences.

A source was quoted as telling the daily, "Director Ali Abbas Zafar has committed to deliver action, stunts and fight sequences that will compete with global standards with Tiger Zinda Hai. 
To shoot for Katrina's action scenes, Tom Struthers, the action and stunts director of the film worked with her. 
Buster Reeves, the fight coordinator of many Hollywood films, also worked with Katrina on this portion. 
Given Struthers shot for certain action sequences for Christopher Nolan's Batman films including the Dark Knight Rises, expect the absolute best from these scenes.
