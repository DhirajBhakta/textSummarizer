One wouldn't have thought that a plus-size model could feature in advertisements, let alone the cover page of leading fashion magazines, even a decade back. 
The March 2017 issue of the magazine is celebrating beauty in all its forms. 
Fashion's Fearless Female', the issue features Ashley Graham, Gigi Hadid, Kendall Jenner, Adwoa Aboah, Liu Wen, Vittoria Ceretti, and Imaan Hammam--all of them in black turtleneck tops, and multi-coloured, high-waist beach shorts.
