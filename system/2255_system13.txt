However, the petitioner gave replies to all the charges and he also tried to support his defence by introducing a large number of documents and a list of students who would appear as witnesses in the inquiry in support of his defence, he said.The student claimed that the findings of the Internal Complaints Committee were also not made available to him by the Womens Cell.He said that the report of the Womens Cell together with the minutes of the meeting of the Senate Students Affairs Committee of March 30, 2016 were placed before the Academic Senate for its consideration on April 5, 2016 and were ratified and he was terminated.The Academic Senate did not give a copy of the report to the petitioner and it also did not give him any show-cause notice asking him to appear before the Senate for hearing.No opportunity of hearing of any kind whatsoever was afforded to the petitioner either by the Senate Students Affairs Committee or by the Academic Senate before the aforesaid decision of terminating the academic programme of the petitioner was taken by them, he said.The student claimed that his defence was not considered at all by the authorities at any stage of the proceedings and there was sufficient material supplied by the petitioner so as to demonstrate that the complaint that was made against him by the female student was malicious.He said that single judge bench of the Allahabad High Court had ordered that the petitioner will submit a written unconditional apology before the institution and had directed the IIT to declare the petitioners result, if he has passed the examination.IIT Kanpur, however, challenged the order of the single- judge bench which the division bench on February 3, set aside.
