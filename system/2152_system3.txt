Pope Francis has lambasted media organisations that focus on scandals and smears and promote fake news as a means of discrediting people in public life. 
It is a sin to defame people, he added.Using striking terminology, Francis said journalists and the media must avoid falling into coprophilia  an abnormal interest in excrement. 
And since people have a tendency towards the sickness of coprophagia, a lot of damage can be done.He also spoke of the danger of using the media to slander political rivals. 
It is a sin and it is hurtful.Disinformation was the greatest potential harm the media could cause, he said, because it directs opinion in only one direction and omits the other part of the truth. 
A year before being elected pope, he told the Italian newspaper La Stampa: Journalists sometimes risk becoming ill from coprophilia and thus fomenting coprophagia, which is a sin that taints all men and women  that is, the tendency to focus on the negative rather than the positive aspects.The popes latest comments on disinformation were made against a backdrop of a global debate over the proliferation of fake news websites and stories that present events through a highly partisan lens.In the US, some observers have suggested that fake news could have swayed the presidential election in favour of Donald Trump.
