The Delhi government has stopped grants to 28 Delhi University colleges funded by it on account of the university not forming governing bodies for the last 10 months.Twelve out of the 28 colleges are fully funded by the government and 16 are partially funded. 
The government had asked Delhi University to form governing bodies before making any appointments.The university is currently in the process of hiring permanent faculty.I can not allow unchecked corruption and irregularities to be sustained on Delhi govt funds in the name of Education.
