The break resulted from the attack on the Sri Lanka team bus in 2009 and has meant Pakistan, bar one series against Zimbabwe two years ago, have played home internationals at neutral venues.Details of which players will feature in the World XI are yet to be established. 
Peshawar Zalmi beat Quetta Gladiators by 58 runs.Giles Clarke, the president of the England and Wales Cricket Board, heads the ICCs Pakistan Task Force that has been looking at ways to end a drought of international cricket and stated the PSL final, while not simply a test run for the World XI series in itself, has shown cricket can be staged in Lahore.The desire is to give the cricket-starved Pakistani supporters the chance to see some of the worlds finest players in live action, Clarke said. 
The youth need inspiring, and the national teams need far more cricket played in familiar terrain. 
Furthermore, the terrorists cannot win and cricket must not give up on Pakistan.The World XI series overseas team will assemble in Dubai on 17 September, before flying to Lahore for four matches on the 22nd, 23rd, 28th and 29th, and follow a similar security plan to the PSL final, the rehearsals for which were overseen by an ICC delegation who included the ECBs security director, Reg Dickason.Malan, speaking before playing Sundays final, said he made himself available after being talked through the security plans and following guarantees over player and spectator safety.
