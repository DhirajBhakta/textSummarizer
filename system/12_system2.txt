Only 26 malls and commercial centres on Mehrauli-Gurgaon (MG) road, Golf Course Road and Sohna Road will offer free parking in their basements, the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) announced on Wednesday.The MCG had earlier said it will waive property tax on basements if the same were used to provide free parking. 
Building owners said the revenue from parking is higher than the gains from the property tax waiver.The updated list is in the public domain on the civic body?
MCG Commissioner V Umashankar said.If the sites mentioned on the list are found levying a parking fee, the public can report complaints on the MCG?
