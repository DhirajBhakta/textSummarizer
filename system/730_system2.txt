I am doing different kinds of characters and they are not chosen on the basis of a particular message to give in a film. 
t want anybody to say that I am an action or a comedy hero. 
I have gone through a lot because of image issues. 
In the first 14 years of my career, I had the image of only being an action hero. 
It came to a stage where I started hating action films. 
I have previously also experimented with different kinds of films. 
I did an off-beat film like Sangharsh (1999), which everyone called a great film, but it didn?
I did a film 8 x 10 Tasveer (2009) but not even 4 by 5 people came to see it in theatres (laughs). 
Every year I have to do 3-4 films. 
I have already signed films to shoot till the next year end.
