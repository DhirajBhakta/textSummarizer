Several eyewitnesses said the "ugly episode" took place around 1 AM when a group of four to five women, apparently working with the various pubs in the vicinity, were waiting outside Sahara Mall for transport. 
Lal said a fresh round of arguments began after which one of the men tried to pull one of the women to where his vehicle was parked.
