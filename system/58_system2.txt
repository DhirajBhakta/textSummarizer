Sana walked the red carpet at a recently held TV awards show in Mumbai, and when she spotted Salman, the two exchanged a hug. 
People just blew it out of proportion because [Salman] had a closed fist, and some dumb people even called it an awkward hug.? 
s not [as if] I went to hug him and he didn?
m not someone who makes people stand and keep talking and falling on their lap.Sana has known Salman ever since she first appeared in 2012 on the reality show Bigg Boss (which was hosted by Salman) and later worked with the actor in the 2014 film Jai Ho. 
I am on good terms with Salman; we share a rapport, I talk to him on and off, we?
