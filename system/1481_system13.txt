Jaipur, Jan 20 (PTI) Actor Rishi Kapoor has revealed he was not ready to do a scene in his father Raj Kapoors "Shree 420" and it was a chocolate bribe by Nargis Dutt that convinced him to do it. 
In that sense, I started taking bribes when I was two-year-old," Rishi said. 
Talking about his family including his wife Neetu and son Ranbir, he said that he is in Jaipur ahead of 37th marriage anniversary which falls on January 22.
