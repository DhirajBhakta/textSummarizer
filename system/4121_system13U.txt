"If India agrees to lower its tariffs on Harley Davidson motorcycles, Indian consumers will buy more Harleys and save less while Harley will sell more Harleys and invest more," Peter Navarro, Director of White House National Trade Council, said in a letter to the editor to The Wall Street Journal. 
"Truly fair and reciprocal trade between the US and its trading partners, rather than the perpetual turn of the screw we receive now, will lead to a thousand similar kinds of adjustments as our bilateral trade deficits fall and savings and investment patterns adjust," Navarro added in the letter published yesterday.
