In what could have been a repeat of last month's Arjun Bhardwaj suicide, a 32-year-old woman lawyer attempted killing herself in Mumbai while live-streaming her life's final moments on social media. 
Priyanka Jethalal Maru planned to jump off the 18th floor of an under-construction building. 
However, officials from the Mumbai Police who reached the location dissuaded her from taking her life.
