A little over four months after the New Delhi Municipal Council cancelled the licence of Le Meridien hotel over alleged non-payment of dues, the council has moved the estate officers court for an eviction order.According to a senior NDMC official, this is the next course of action under the public premises act (Eviction of Unauthorised Occupants Act) 1971.The estate officers court, which is designated by the Delhi Lieutenant Governor, will conduct the hearing that could take four to five months.They will seek the hotels comments, hear arguments and ultimately pass an order. 
If the order goes against any party (the hotel or NDMC), they can appeal within 12 days at the district court, the official said.The NDMC had earlier ordered action against four of its officials over alleged irregularities in the recovery of dues that the five-star hotel owed the civic body. 
The four officers mentioned in the report are the then director estate, one deputy director estate, a senior accounts officer and a senior assistant.
