Maharashtra has become the first state to make social boycott a crime after President Pranab Mukherjee cleared the legislation. 
The Maharashtra Prohibition of People from Social Boycott (Prevention Prohibition and Redressal) Act prescribes a maximum punishment of three year in jail and a fine of Rs1lakh. 
After the Presidents assent, the Maharashtra government published the Act in the gazette. 
The Act has been cleared by the Central government.
