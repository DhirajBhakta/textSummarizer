New Delhi, Jul 28 (PTI) No proposal is under consideration to scrap the Sahayak system in the Army, the government today said, notwithstanding rising cases of jawans coming out openly against the colonial-era provision. 
"No proposal for scrapping the Sahayak system, presently in place in the Army, is under consideration in the Ministry at present," he said, in a brief written reply. 
Last month, a senior Army official had said that the force is actively considering recruiting civilian staff in peace stations to do away with the Sakayak system.
