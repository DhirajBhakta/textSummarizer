The Delhi high court on Tuesday declined Aam Aadmi Partys request to use second-generation EVMs with paper trail in the April 23 civic polls in the national capital.Justice AK Pathak refused immediate relief to the ruling party, saying that nothing can be done at the eleventh hour. 
We cannot stay the election nor pass an order to use electronic voting machines which are not there, the court said while seeking a response from the Election Commission of India and the Delhi State Election Commission by Friday, the next date of hearing.The AAP and its candidate Mohammad Tahir Hussain have approached the high court for using second-generation EVMs attached with Voter Verified Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) in the elections to the capitals three municipal corporations.The courts order came after State Election Commission counsel Sumeet Pushkarna opposed the plea on the ground that the MCD elections are slated for April 23 and changing all EVMs with VVPAT is not feasible in four days.The counsel said the EVMs to be used in the civic polls are the same that were used in 2015 assembly elections, after which the AAP came to power.
