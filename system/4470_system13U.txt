Disclosing the "tax-related investigations" in its latest annual report published last week, HSBC further said it has set aside USD 773 million (over Rs 5,000 crore) as a provision for various tax- and money laundering-related matters. 
"Various tax administrations, regulatory and law enforcement authorities around the world, including in the US, France, Belgium, Argentina and India, are conducting investigations and reviews of HSBC Swiss Private Bank and other HSBC companies in connection with allegations of tax evasion or tax fraud, money laundering and unlawful cross- border banking solicitation," it said.
