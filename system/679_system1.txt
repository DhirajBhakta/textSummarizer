When Shahid Kapoor and Vishal Bharadwaj announced their third collaboration after Kaminey and Haider, the expectations were sky-high. 
However, Rangoon failed to set the cash registers ringing and fizzled out at the box office after earning only around Rs 20 crore.In an interview with Filmfare, Shahid talked about the debacle of his last release. 
"When a film doesn't do the kind of business or get the appreciation it should get, it's heartbreaking. 
But I am sure when we work together again we will do something great," the actor said.Shahid added that the failure of the film was not on him. 
I am happy my part was appreciated but I am sad for the film not doing well," he said.Shahid will be seen next in Sanjay Leela Bhansali's Padmavati, which also features Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh.
