National Award-winning filmmaker Vetrimaaran on Monday came out in support of jallikattu saying that before asking for a ban on the traditional and ancient bull-taming sport, people should think about banning crackers on Diwali and immersing Lord Ganesh idols in water during Ganesh Chaturthi which disturbs the eco-system."
The court also held that bulls cannot be used as performing animals either for jallikattu events or for bullock-cart races in Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra or elsewhere in the country.After that, people have been demanding that the central government should take necessary legal steps for the continued conduct of the popular sport.
