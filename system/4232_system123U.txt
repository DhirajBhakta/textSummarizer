The Vijay Hazare trophy quarter-final between Vidarbha and Jharkhand was all about one man. 
Rarely has a domestic match at this venue grabbed such attendance, but with Former India skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni at the centre, all the commotion was expected. 
With Vidarbha managing just 159, the crowd at the Air Force Sports Complex in Palam was waiting for their hero to come out to bat.
