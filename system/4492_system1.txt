Jaipur, Feb 24 (PTI) The site of an indefinite hunger strike for Special Backward Class quota turned into the marriage venue for 26-year-old Devraj Gujjar, who tied the nuptial knot here, as he chose not to leave the protest. 
But after the high court struck down the SBC quota, they, like several others, did not get appointment letters. 
He said his family members made all arrangements for the wedding.
