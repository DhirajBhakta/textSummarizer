I was very clear in my mind what my core team would be and you have just heard that," Shastri said after Choudhary announced the appointment in a press conference.His appointment marks a complete u-turn for the BCCI, which had named Zaheer as bowling consultant initially before clarifying that it was for specific overseas tours.There is also, no clarity on Rahul Dravid's position as batting consultant either."
The former India bowler was also Shastri's teammate from their Under-19 and India days.Shastri, who was in London when his appointment was announced, also thanked the Cricket Advisory Committee -- comprising Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly and VVS Laxman -- for picking him for the high-profile job."
