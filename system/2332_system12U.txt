On the third championship point, Muguruza stops mid-point and challenges, what judgment, because Williamss effort was long and Muguruza is the Wimbledon champion for the first time! 
Second set: *Williams 5-7, 0-2 Muguruza (*denotes next server)Four games ago Williams had two points for the first set but the wheels are coming off now. 15-0, 30-0, 40-0 for Muguruza. 
You feel that opening set was more important for Williams to win, can she survive another two sets of this intensity against an opponent 14 years her junior Williams has enough energy to get to 30-0, before Muguruza gets back to 30-all.
