All eyes are on the national capital today as Delhi votes for its civic bodies in the MCD election 2017. 
The polls are being closely watched in national politics, with the Bharatiya Janata Party, Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party all in fray. 
The BJP will look to continue its winning momentum, having resoundingly won Uttar Pradesh in the recent Assembly elections as well as a number of civic bodies in Maharashtra and Odisha.
