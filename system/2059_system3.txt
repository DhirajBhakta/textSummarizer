When a Flipkart delivery man arrived to deliver a smartphone to 22-year-old Varun Kumar, he was murdered. 
Nanjundaswamy, a Flipkart employee in Bengaluru, went to a gym to deliver a smartphone but Varun was apparently waiting there with a knife. 
Varun, a gym trainer, ordered the phone online and gave the gym as his address, but since he did not have Rs 11,999 for the Redmi Note 3, he decided to murder the delivery man. 
Later in the night, after the bank on the first floor and a fruit stall in the basement had shut for the night, Varun shifted the body around 11 pm to the basement. 
?Varun had asked his father to lend him the amount, but he refused and the gym trainer was desperate to get a phone.
