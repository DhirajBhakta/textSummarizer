s iPhone from the delivery truck into the modified van through a hole in its roof.Dutch police spokesman Ed Kraszewski said that officers had long been investigating thefts from trucks but had remained sceptical that such a heist could be pulled off. 
The thieves are accused of being responsible for emptying 17 trucks of expensive goods since 2015, according to local reports.Romanian police released a video, shot from a police helicopter of a similar raid from 2012, where thieves drove up behind a truck using an angle grinder to break open the doors and steal goods while other members of the gang held-back traffic in other cars.Dutch police will send the fingerprints of the suspects to colleagues around Europe to check for potential matches to previous crimes.
