Louis on Sunday.The self-proclaimed 'Modern day Maharaja' gave a 'Khallas' -- a variation of the 'Full Nelson Slam' to finish off the 14-time champion and get the three count.Orton, who was distracted by the Singh Brothers went on a rampage outside the ring as he hit them off with RKO's and made sure there's no more distraction coming his way. 
But, when he returned to the ring, Mahal hit his finisher to retain his championship.Talking about his victory at the Talking Smack -- a post match show -- he said that it was a great feeling. 
I'm only getting better every week...every week I improve in the ring and I intend on being a long time champion.
