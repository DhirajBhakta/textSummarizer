So this break that everybody has made a thing about really didn't happen. 
I pride myself for the goodwill I earned for the work I did in the first three years. 
I could hold on to that great work in the beginning and confidently come back with a film two years later.So did you use those 10 months to reassess your career and bring about a change?
Even when I watch a film, I feel like I want to wear that skirt, have that hair and have a Raj (in my life). 
Yes, I used to walk and sing on the first floor when I was working in the marketing department.
