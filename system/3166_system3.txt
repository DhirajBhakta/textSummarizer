The parents of a dead 15-year-old who appealed to Facebook to allow them access to her account to see if she was being bullied before her death have lost their claim in court.Berlin?
s court of appeal ruled on Wednesday that the parents of the teenager, who died in 2012 after falling in front of an underground train, had no claim to access her details or chat history. 
Before the ruling both Facebook and the parents of the girl, whose identity has not been made public, reserved the right in the event of a defeat to take an appeal to Germany?
The ruling on Wednesday was based on weighing up inheritance laws drawn up almost 120 years ago and the rights of parents towards minors, with the telecommunications secrecy law introduced to protect the privacy of telephone conversations which was updated by the constitutional court in 2009 to include emails.
