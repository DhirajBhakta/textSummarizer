But one of the sentries had some awkward moments as Narendra Modi's car arrived.WATCH THIS VIDEO US President @realDonaldTrump welcomes PM @narendramodi on his arrival at @WhiteHouse in Washington D.C.https://t.co/JYmHbWQhywpic.twitter.com/eN8Yb3fjg1Two Marine corps, standing on either sides of the car PM Modi was in, could be seen saluting as the car arrives. 
Was the White House ignorant of the fact that PM Modi's wife doesn't live, travel with him Or do they open the left door anyway?Not just that, the guard on the left side of the car could be seen struggling to open the door he was supposed to.
