This year's edition of the Met Gala saw a seamless blend of every fashion genre there exists. 
From outfits that were bizarre to those that left nothing to the imagination--the event grabbed eyeballs for a variety of reasons. 
But what made this year's Met Gala special for us Indians was the presence of two gorgeous Bollywood stars, Priyanka Chopra and Deepika Padukone. 
When the two ladies--flawless in their own ways--stepped on the red carpet, the comparisons knew no bounds. 
And while Priyanka's record-shattering Ralph Lauren trenchcoat-styled gown inspired a gazillion memes and took away the cake in the novelty department, Deepika's debut received a lukewarm response.Also Read: Deepika Padukone's Met Gala debut was beautiful, but out of placeBut guess what, despite making a gorgeous-yet-low key debut, Deepika Padukone's Tommy Hilfiger satin gown was one of the most Googled outfits from the Met Gala night. just wow!!
