The Women's March that followed President Donald Trump's inauguration day, caused a huge furore in its remarkable attempt to herald an end to the beginning of a new era of dictatorship.When women all across the globe and their supporters took to the streets to stand in solidarity against Trump's fascist regime, they garnered empathy indeed but was not bereft of controversy.Some have been sceptical if the march would be an end in itself. 
Some wonder if this march would rightly pave way to address not just white woman's feminism but the over-all issue of equality and human rights.We cannot certify what this would lead to but, at least, one cannot deny that such a mass uprising is commendable in its very approach of flagging issues that might impact civilisation in general.Among those numerous posters and placards that made news, what caught one's eye are women wearing colourful hijabs. 
And it is not just any hijab. 
Take a closer look and you will find they are made out of the American flag.Also Read: Japan threatens India with WTO on steel as Donald Trump era heralds rising tensionsEver since his election campaign days, Trump has posed himself as the new manifest of bigotry, claiming to ban Muslims and other immigrants from the country altogether.

And the American salad bowl cannot deny religious freedom to any of its residents.
