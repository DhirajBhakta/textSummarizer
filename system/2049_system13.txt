Delhi Metro stations are soon going to have giant digital walls to play video advertisements minus the audio. 
Digital walls will give us the chance to bring in multiple advertisers at the same time and in the same space, a metro official said.Moreover, it is also a lot easier to manage. 
But the size of these walls is going to get bigger at busy stations like Rajiv Chowk, Kashmere Gate, Central Secretariat and New Delhi.
