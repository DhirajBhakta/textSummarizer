 The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) is finding it tough to finalise construction of a flyover at Iffco chowk due to the presence of high tension overhead electricity wires.The flyover construction is complete except for a portion where the high tension wires are running along the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway from Shankar Chowk to Iffco Chowk. 
The construction of the U-turn flyover is disturbed but the HVPN is not ready to take a decision, said AK Sharma, project director, NHAI, adding that the HVPN might change the plan.Anil Yadav, superintending engineer (SE), HVPN, said, We hope the approval from headquarters come very soon in this regard.
