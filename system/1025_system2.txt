Nikita Razvozzhayev, a correspondent with the pro-Kremlin NTV channel, was extolling the professionalism of Russias airborne forces when a bearded man staggered up to the presenter and began an expletive-laden rant about invading Ukraine. 
Law enforcement officers detained the 32-year-old assailant and opened a criminal probe into the assault, NTV reported. 
The annual paratrooper holiday regularly brings drunken bedlam to city streets and parks around Russia as former and current members of the elite units cut loose. 
Police said that the attacker  identified as a Russian nationalist Dmitry Orlov  has never served in the paratroopers.
