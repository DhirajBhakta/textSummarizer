The Reserve Bank of India is still counting the demonetised currency returned to it and it also cant say how much black money has been recovered, governor Urjit Patel has told a parliamentary panel.Patel, who appeared before a parliamentary standing committee on finance on Wednesday, failed to give an estimate of the fake currency recovered, sources said.In a sudden decision, the Modi government had on November 8 announced scrapping of 500 and 1,000 rupee notes, taking out 86% of all cash from the economy, disrupting economic activity in Asias third-largest economy.Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said the move was aimed at weeding out black money and choking counterfeit currency that was being to fund terrorist activities.Patel couldnt provide to the panel, chaired by Congress leader M Veerappa Moily, a date by which the Reserve Bank of India would come out with the exact amount of the money deposited.Prior to November 8, the currency in circulation was Rs 17.7 lakh crore.
