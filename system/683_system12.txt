The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) has criticised the railways over cleanliness and management of linen, and suggested putting in place a mechanism to ensure strict compliance to norms.In its report tabled in Parliament on Friday, the countrys top auditor said the washing and sanitation of linen as well as blankets are not done as per the norms established by the railways.The Railway Board has instructed that washing of linen (except blankets) should be done after every single use and blankets be dry-cleaned every two months.Various zonal railways had provided periodicity of once every fortnight/month/once in two-three months for washing blankets, said the CAG report.The CAG has collected data on number of blankets in use and those washed during the review (2012-2013 to 2015-2016) period in 33 selected depots of coaches.It was found that in 14 selected depots, under nine zonal railways, no blankets had been dry-washed in the said period.
