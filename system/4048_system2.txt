An RTI activist from Punjab, Parinder Singh Kitana has accused Yoga guru Baba Ramdev of commercialising martyrs Shaheed-E-Azam Bhagat Singh, Rajguru and Sukhdev in a recent advertisement of Patanjali products.Citing print media advertisements, in which Baba Ramdev owner of Patanjali Yogpeeth and Divya Yog Mandir (both trusts) had used the photos of martyrs on martyrdom day of Bhagat Singh on March 23, Kitana in a legal notice, said that using the martyr's photos was nothing but an act of commercialisation of the supreme sacrifices made by them."
You have made no bones of your intentions by stating in the advertisement itself? that the products of Indian companies like Patanjali should be purchased by the countrymen, in preference over foreign companies, since the Martyrs had fought against the foreigners," the legal notice sent to Patanjali Yogpeeth and Divya Yog Mandir trusts said.ACTIVIST DEMANDS UNCONDITIONAL APOLOGY FROM PATANJALIThe legal notice, issued on March 25, stated that besides amounting to commercialisation of the name of martyrs, the advertisement also amounts to insulting them and the cause for which they have sacrificed their lives. 
The complainant has demanded an unconditional apology from Patanjali and also an assurance that similar things will not be repeated in the future. 
Kitara has also threatened pursue the case in the court in case the apology is not tendered and published in the newspapers which carried the controversial advertisements within a period of one month.
