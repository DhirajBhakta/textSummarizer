Madhya Pradesh Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan announced in the state assembly that the government from now on will give Rs one crore as compensation to the family members of anyone from the state who attains martyrdom for the country.Speaking on the adjournment moved by the Opposition Congress party on the Mandsaur police firing in which six farmers were killed, Chouhan said, "Opposition members are questioning me. 
Asking why I gave compensation of Rs one crore to those whose family members died in the police firing. 
I hope I never have to do this but god forbid if anyone from the state gets martyred, my government will give a compensation of Rs one crore to the family members."
We were not part of the agitation from day one but yes we stood by the farmers after six of them were killed in police firing.? We still stand with the farmers and the government should accept that it was failure on the part of its machinery," he said.Ajay Singh also raised the issue of farmers committing suicide across the state and read out names of farmers who committed suicide in the chief minister's home district after June 6.
