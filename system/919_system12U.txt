Mumbais iconic Maratha Mandir  which has been running the movie Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge (DDLJ) for the past two decades  had another first, but not the kind that would make Shah Rukh Khan fans happy. 
For the first time in 22 years, the films matinee show was cancelled for the trailer screening of Shraddha Kapoor-starrer Haseena Parkar on Tuesday. 
The film is a biopic on gangster Dawood Ibrahims sister, who is also known as Queen of Mumbai.Manoj Desai, executive director of Maratha Mandir Cinema, said the makers of the film thought of launching the trailer there as Parkar lived in Dongri, which is very close to Maratha Mandir.
