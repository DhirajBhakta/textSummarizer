The Supreme Court Bar Association and the Lahore High Court Bar Association have said they would launch a countrywide movement if Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif doesn't resign on the Panama Papers scandal in seven days. 
According to a report by The Dawn, the two bar associations in a joint declaration said that following the Supreme Court's order on the Panama Papers case, the Prime Minister should no longer hold the position and resign within seven days.This comes after the Supreme Court Bar Association and the Lahore High Court Bar Association members clashed with the lawyers supporting the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML_N) government. 
The case against Sharif emerged last year after the Panama Papers leak linked his children to offshore companies in the British Virgin Islands in relation to the purchase of upmarket property in London.Sharif and his family have denied any wrongdoing.
