Veteran actor Amol Palekar filed a PIL with Supreme Court questioning the censorship laws that have not been contested for over 47 years now. 
The 72-year-old actor has sought relaxation in the censorship of films by means of removal of pre-censorship of movies. 
According to a report in Scroll, Palekar in the petition has pointed out the absence of a member with a legal background in CBFC which often leads the board to repeatedly violate filmmakers' fundamental right to speech and expression.
