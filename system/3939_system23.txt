A woman had to give birth in the absence of a doctor in a government hospital in Bundi, and the male nurse who assisted her during the delivery told her that her child was dead and should be taken to the burial ground. 
Following the male nurse's advice, the family took the new born for the burial. 
When the deputy superintendent saw a ruckus, he went on to defend the nurse and said that since the child is born weak, there are hardly any chances of survival.
