While taking her to the hospital, her water broke and we had to get the baby delivered in the van itself, near Netaji Subhash Marg, says Inspector Rajendra Sehrawat, who was present during the incident. 
Weve briefed our staff not to disturb the cord, giving the mother her privacy and taking the mother and baby to the nearest hospital. 
But this time, the womans husband and our inspectors had to take charge.
