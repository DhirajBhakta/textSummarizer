North Delhi Mayor Preety Agarwal said the redevelopment of the Town Hall in Chandni Chowk -- the headquarters of the erstwhile unified MCD -- into a centre of cultural and social heritage would be taken up on a PPP model. 
He said if all goes well, the fresh project would be taken up in the "next nine months and is likely to be completed within two years".
