Los Angeles, Mar 1 (PTI) Singer Rihanna has been honoured with the 2017 Harvard Humanitarian of the Year award. 
"So I made it to Harvard. 
Never thought Id be able to say that in my life, but it feels good," Rihanna said as she jokingly flipped her hair. 
And I would say to myself, When I grow up and I get rich, Im gonna save kids all over the world. 
I just didnt know I would be in a position to do that by the time I was a teenager," she added explaining that she has had a passion for helping people since she was a young girl watching commercials about how a quarter could help save a childs life.
