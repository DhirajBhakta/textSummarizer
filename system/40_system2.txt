A Republican senator said Tuesday that US President Donald Trump has told him he would go to war to destroy North Korea rather than allow it to develop a long-range nuclear-armed missile.Influential lawmaker Lindsey Graham, a foreign policy hawk, told NBCs Today Show: There is a military option: To destroy North Koreas programme and North Korea itself.Last week, North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un boasted that his country could now strike any target in the United States after carrying out its latest intercontinental ballistic missile test.World powers have been trying to stifle Pyongyangs weapons programme through United Nations-backed sanctions, but have failed to daunt the regime and Washington is growing frustrated.Graham said if diplomacy, and in particular pressure from the Norths neighbour China, fails to halt the programme then the United States will have no choice but to take devastating military action.Theyve kicked the can down the road for 20 years.
