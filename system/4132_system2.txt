This time around, the filmmaker invited the wrath of a certain section of Twitter for his comments on Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath.When Yogi Adityanath was announced as the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, writer Chetan Bhagat tweeted, "#YogiAdityanath as UP CM. 
Shirish Kunder's tweets on the UP Chief Minister were probably in response to Bhagat's 'logic'.In the now-deleted tweets, Kunder wrote, "Hoping a goon will stop rioting once he's allowed to rule is like expecting a rapist to stop raping once he's allowed to rape."
And the next tweet read, "Going by the logic of making a goon as CM so that he behaves, Dawood can be CBI director. 
Even though Yogi Adityanath's appointment as the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh has raised several eyebrows, Shirish Kunder's tweets were not spared. 
And for the uninitiated, Kunder has more often than not been roasted on Twitter for his views on politics.
