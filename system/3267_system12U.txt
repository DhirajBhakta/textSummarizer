According to police, Nabi was walking along Nazimuddin Road in Sector F-8 when he was stopped at a check post. 
Police demanded to check his visa documents after he told them that he was an Indian. 
However, he could not produce any documents and was taken into police custody. 
An official of the Indian High Commission, however, said that the mission does not have any information about the arrest so far.The arrest came days after the International Court of Justice stayed the execution of Indian national Kulbhushan Jadhav, who was sentenced to death by a Pakistani military court on charges of "involvement in espionage and sabotage activities" against the country.The "suspicious person" has been booked under the Foreigners Act, 1946.
