The tax profiles of 17.92 lakh people were "not in line" with the cash deposits made by them during the 50-day demonetisation period. 
Under the Operation Clean Money launched on January 31, the I-T department sought online response on source of cash deposited by these persons. 
The verification is also closed if the cash deposit is declared under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana," Gangwar said. 
In a separate reply to a question in the Lok Sabha, Gangwar said during April 1, 2014 to December 31, 2016, the I-T department conducted searches in 1,838 groups of assessees, seizing undisclosed assets worth Rs 2,607 crore.
