At the pre-release event of the upcoming Telugu film Rarandoi Veduka Chudham, Chalapathi Rao said that women are only fit for having sex with men. 
A day after the video went viral, several celebrities including Nagarjuna, Naga Chaitanya and Rakul Preet Singh have slammed the actor for his insensitive remarks. 
I always respect women personally and in my films/I definitely do not agree wt Chalapati rao's derogatory comments/dinosaurs do not exist!!

On Wednesday, Chalapathi Rao issued a statement apologising for his anti-women remarks. 
That's why I said woman are harmless and that's why we sleep with them.
