The new helicopter that the state plans to buy for its VIPs is likely to cost nearly Rs90 crore and may take at least a year to be delivered. 
While procuring the chopper will take four months, the bidding process before and registration after it will lengthen the procedure, said an official.A committee headed by chief secretary Sumeet Mullick decided to speed up the process on Wednesday. 
Its decision comes two weeks after chief minister Devendra Fadnavis escaped a potential chopper accident while returning from Alibaug.During a meeting at Mantralaya, the committee endorsed a decision to suspend the chopper?
The state favours the advanced make of Sikorki S76, which was grounded after it crash-landed in Latur in May.
