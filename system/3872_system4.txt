Farmers from Tamil Nadu ran naked near the Prime Minister's office today, to protest against lack of government assistance in their fight for a drought relief package for a state.The farmers, who have been protesting at Jantar Mantar for 28 days, wanted to drop off their memorandum at the Prime Minister's Office.According to an Indian Express report, a delegation of seven farmers were taken to the PMO and were told that they would meet with Prime Minister Narendra Modi.When they reached there, they found PM Modi was unavailable. 
To garner attention, these farmers have resorted to all kinds of methods like cutting themselves and holding dead rats and snakes in their mouth.Late in March some farmers even wore skulls of dead Tamil Nadu farmers, symbolising the fate that awaits them if the centre does not help.Two farmers even attempted suicide at Jantar Mantar.
