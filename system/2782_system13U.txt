The last time India and China were engaged in a major military stand-off in Sikkim was in 1967.On that instance, just five years after India's traumatic 1962 war defeat, the Indian Army gave the Chinese a bloody nose, according to accounts from the time. 
More than 80 Indian soldiers were killed, while estimates say between 300 to 400 Chinese troops were killed.It was certainly a different time: One account suggests that to protest China's actions then in Sikkim, which reportedly included a Chinese complaint of a herd of sheep being stolen, a 43-year-old Member of Parliament by the name of Atal Bihari Vajpayee drove a herd of sheep to the Chinese Embassy in Shantipath in New Delhi to stage a rather colourful protest.There are fascinating parallels from the 1967 incident.
