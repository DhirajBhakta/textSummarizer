Berlin/ New Delhi, Mar 8 (PTI) Qatar Airways plans to set up an airline in India along with the Gulf nations sovereign wealth fund, its chief executive Akbar Al Baker said today. 
This will be the first of its kind airline venture in India that would be fully-owned by overseas entities and the proposal comes nearly nine months after the Indian government allowed 100 per cent foreign direct investment in the airlines segment. 
Qatar Airways, which is among the top three Gulf carriers, has been exploring investment opportunities in the fast- growing Indian aviation market. 
"We are joining hands with the investment arm of State of Qatar to start a domestic airline in India with a 100 per cent investment," Al Baker said at a press meet in Berlin. 
"We are doing this because Indian government has opened up the foreign direct investment in (setting up) an airline in India," he added. 
Currently, foreign airlines are allowed to invest only up to 49 per cent in Indian carriers.
