The crime came to light after the girls family brought her to Kalawati Hospital with injuries.The cases are a bitter reminder of the night of December 16, 2012, when the physiotherapy student was brutally gang-raped by six men on a chartered bus that she had boarded after she failed to get an auto or a public bus from south Delhis Saket to Dwarka.The crime triggered massive protests across the country as thousands of people demanded stricter laws and police patrolling to improve a shameful record of safety for female citizens in Delhi, where a woman reports a rape every four hours.The protests caused far-reaching changes in Indias rape laws and a nationwide churning that effected sensitisation programmes in police and administration.Similar to the crime four years ago, the 20-year-old woman said she got into the cab as she was getting late and no auto rickshaw had agreed to take her for the past 1.5 hours, police said.The woman said that she fought back against the driver and managed to escape from the car.
