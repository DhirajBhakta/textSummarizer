It was last week that Kriti Sanon posted a video where she is dancing to a song from Mubarakan. 
Immediately Kamaal R Khan, the serial offender, posted a tasteless comment on the actor targeting the poor box office performnce of Kriti?
s last cinematic outing, Raabta. 
Adding her voice to the chorus was actor Bhairavi Goswami who last appeared in Hate Story.Taking to Twitter, Bhairavi wrote, ?
she is really behaving like a deranged woman. 
How did she become an actress. 
No headlight, no bumper. 
Even college students look better.? 
The crass tweet soon got a serious backlash on Twitter with many questioning who Bhairavi was.But the best reaction, by far, has been that of Kriti herself.
