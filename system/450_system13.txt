Do you remember that famous night on television, November 8, where they said  these dishonest people  where they said there is no path to victory for Donald Trump  But do you remember that incredible night with the maps and the Republicans are red and the Democrats are blue, and that map was so red, it was unbelievable and they didnt know what to say And you know we have a tremendous disadvantage in the electoral college  popular vote is much easier.So I have to tell you, what we did, in all fairness, is an unbelievable tribute to you and all of the other millions and millions of people that came out and voted for Make America Great Again.And by the way, under the Trump administration, youll be saying Merry Christmas again when you go shopping.
