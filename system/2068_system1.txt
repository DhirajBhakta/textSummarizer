First India, then Venezuela and now Australia is considering the proposal to demonetise its 100 dollar currency note as the country attempts to target tax evaders.While the Narendra Modi-led government has already started its fight against black money in the country, the Australian government is setting up a task force to curb black money and will appoint representatives during its mid-year budget meeting. 
UBS had recently batted for removal of the highest-denomination currency in Australia, and said the country can follow India's example.
