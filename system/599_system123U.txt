According to officials, Delhi airport has become the transit point of drug trade as more than 19 people have been arrested from here till date, which is almost double from last year's corresponding period.Officials claim it is an indicator that the drug market is flourishing in the city and that there are good incentives given by the drug mafia which pulls so many into this risky business.Narcotics Control Bureau's (NCB) records show that 15 people were arrested in eight cases for smuggling 18.05kg of cocaine till July this year while in 2016, only two cases were registered and 215 grams of the drug was seized.
