He had also complained to then deputy commissioner Hardeep Singh on the issue.As per the project approval, the (ground-floor) areas cannot be monetised. 
No commercial activity is allowed in these areas, but no rules are being followed by the commercial units, he said.In reply to Maliks RTI query, the district town planning (DTP)department said no compiled information is available. 
Malik had asked for the number of hospitals, educational and commercial establishments making direct or indirect commercial use of areas sanctioned for service and parking purposes.We are aware of the issue and all these commercial establishments will soon be removed from malls and hospitals, said Rajender Sharma, DTP (enforcement), Huda.
