A group 50 students and teachers on Monday staged protested at the University of Mumbais (MUs) campus,Fort, against the delay in declaring degree college results. 
They also voiced opposition to what they termed as extreme harassment of examiners by issuing  threatening  letters to them.This year, the MU adopted an on-screen marking process for assessing answersheets against  the traditional pen-and-paper evaluation. 
The decision caused a delay in declaring results, as the MU could not appoint an agency to conduct on-screen marking for a long time.
