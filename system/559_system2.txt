Top players in the country at that time are likely to get those wild card entries.India's best singles players, save for Ankita Raina (262), can't get direct entry into the main draws of WTA 125K level events with their current rankings. 
I would like to request AITA to host more of these tournaments," Ankita Raina told PTI from Prague.Thandi said, "It will be great for women's tennis with that kind of event happening in India."
We have understood that proposal should be presented in a particular manner to get sponsorship," Sutar, who will be Tournament Director for both WTA and ATP World event in January, said.Sutar is hoping that Raina will be able to get a direct entry and Rutuja will be a strong contender for the singles wild card since she is a player from Maharashtra."
