They look like premium Rado watches at first glance, only they are not. 
Several first copies of the high-end watches were seized by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence  at cargo complex of Delhi?
The watches were part of a consignment coming from China. 
Though the sender had declared it as cosmetics and other daily use items, when opened, watches, shoes, pen drives, memory cards and other mobile accessories were found in huge quantities,? 
a DRI official said.The seizure was made on Thursday, but the DRI is still counting the number of watches and evaluation is on. ?
One watch can be sold from Rs 4,000 to Rs 10,000. 
Officials said other items in the consignment, including shoes and sunglasses, seem to be original but DRI is taking help of the companies to check their originality.
