Teams are on the lookout for other persons and trying to identify them through video footage, Akash Tomar, superintendent of police (city), said.A large number of locals and Congress workers started gathering outside the Haj House near river Hindon from Monday afternoon, despite prohibitory orders in place in the district. 
We will protest against the police and the administration and will also hand them a memorandum about the lathi charge carried out by police on innocent people who were staging a peaceful dharna outside the Haj House. 
The decision was taken to protect the environment and the river ecology. 
The influx of thousands of pilgrims is bound to create garbage issues in the river zone. 
This decision was taken earlier to avoid being in contempt of court, Raza had said.In the meantime, the district administration has deployed police and provincial armed constabulary personnel outside the Haj House and are keeping a tight vigil on activities that may lead to an escalation of law and order.
