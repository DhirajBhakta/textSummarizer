The message was being flashed each time we visited the website and unlike floating advertisements, it was blocking the entire homepage,? 
said Ashwini Tripathi, an IT specialist who handles the website.According to Tripathi, the website was developed two years ago by a Noida-based company which was informed about the messages. ?
We have cleared the glitch and advised the municipal committee to buy additional security features for the website,? 
The officials of the municipal committee decided not to register a police complaint regarding the matter.Police officials said they were not aware of the hacking. ?
An investigation will be ordered regarding the matter once a formal police complaint is filed by the municipal committee,?
