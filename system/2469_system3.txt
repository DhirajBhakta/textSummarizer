The website of the municipal committee in Uttar Pradeshs Rampur district was hacked by a person, who called himself a Kashmiri and posted messages demanding freedom on it on Wednesday, an official said on Thursday.The message started with Hacked by NABEEL that flashed in place of the usual homepage of the Rampur municipal committee.A single BEE is ignored but when millions come together the bravest RUN IN FEAR. 
The one thing the government fear is the day we stand together, it said.The alleged hacker wrote GO INDIA GO BACK WE WANT FREEDOM, below it and followed it an extended note regarding Kashmiris and Muslims. 
The message ended with, i am a Kashmiri, it is my crime But I am proud committing the crime.The hacking was first noticed by municipal officials while uploading new tenders.The message was being flashed each time we visited the website and unlike floating advertisements, it was blocking the entire homepage, said Ashwini Tripathi, an IT specialist who handles the website.According to Tripathi, the website was developed two years ago by a Noida-based company which was informed about the messages. 
The experts from the company cleared it hours after we informed them about it, said Tripathi adding, No harm was done to the website or any other data attached to it by the hack.The website lacked security features and was easily hacked into. 
But the hacker apparently was only an amateur and was able to alter only the homepage, said Faizan Alam, principal programmer of the company.We have cleared the glitch and advised the municipal committee to buy additional security features for the website, he added. 
The officials of the municipal committee decided not to register a police complaint regarding the matter.Police officials said they were not aware of the hacking. 
An investigation will be ordered regarding the matter once a formal police complaint is filed by the municipal committee, they said.
