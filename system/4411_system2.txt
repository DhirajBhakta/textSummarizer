She began drinking at the age of 16, but it's been 68 days since Pooja Bhatt touched a drop of alcohol. 
It was only recently that Pooja opened up about his alcohol addiction and how she overcame it. 
In an interview to Mid-Day, Bhatt girl revealed that she pulled the plug on alcohol last December and has been sober ever since. 
"Luckily, I pulled the plug before it became impossible for me to stop. 
But being the daughter of an alcoholic makes you four times more susceptible to becoming one," she added. 
But daddy Bhatt quit drinking years ago.? After being in love with her bottle for over decades, it was text message from her dad Mahesh Bhatt which made her rethink. 
During one the chats, Mahesh told Pooja that if she loves him, then she should love herself too as he lives in her. 
And this text struck a chord with Pooja and she decided to take the reigns in her hands. 
She added that even in the film industry there were people drinking copiously."
"I was 45 and if I wanted to give myself 10 years of living, I had to quit now before I drank myself to the grave. 
I had to reclaim the sharper, brighter me which had got watered down," she added.
