New Delhi, Jul 30 (PTI) Feeding or sheltering stray dogs in the common area of a private property can cause nuisance, the Delhi High Court has said, warning two south Delhi residents to ensure that the canines do not cause fear or discomfort to others. 
The court also said in a recent order that the two cannot feed the dogs or chain them in the driveway. 
The bench said it was the duty of the two "to ensure that the stray dogs do not cause any nuisance to the other residents within the same property and in the neighbourhood". 
The court noted that keeping stray dogs would "cause fear and discomfort" to others living or coming there "who are not accustomed to keeping pet dogs". 
The order came on the plea by one Om Prakash Saini, who jointly holds the property with the two respondents, claiming that keeping and feeding the stray dogs in the common driveway was "causing immense nuisance and harassment for the other residents". 
The order comes in the backdrop of a January order of the Supreme Court which categorically said "stray dogs have a right to live."
