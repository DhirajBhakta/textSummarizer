While the rollout day of July 1 will be known as GST Day, all the offices of the Central Board of Excise and Customs (CBEC) have been instructed to be open on Saturday as a trade facilitation measure. 
"Henceforth, all field offices from the Chief Commissioners office to the Range should serve as GST Seva- Kendras for effective trade facilitation," it said. 
A guidance manual for such GST Seva Kendras too has been circulated to all offices in a bid to standardise quality taxpayer services. 
CBEC also asked for strengthening of the GST Seva-Kendras to enable them discharge their functions effectively and promptly.
