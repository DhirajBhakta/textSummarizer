Ever since the trailer of Salman Khan's Tubelight released, a lot has been said about how the film would probably break Baahubali 2's records at the box office. 
In fact, Salman's not-so-good friend Vivek Oberoi in a recent interview said that he wants Tubelight to break the records of Baahubali 2. 
He told IANS, "I want Tubelight to break records of Baahubali and become a superhit film. 
I feel Tubelight has all the capacity to make Hindi cinema proud all around the world and I would like to wish all the luck for the entire team of Tubelight."
In an interview to Firstpost, the Bajrangi Bhaijaan actor said, "I doubt that Tubelight will break Baahubali 2's record, because the latter is one of the most freakish films that has been made.
