Hoisted with much fanfare, Indias tallest Tricolour which was fluttering at a height of 360 ft near the India-Pakistan border at Attari has been out of sight for the past three months. 
Amritsar deputy commissioner (DC) Kamaldeep Singh Sangha has even written to the state home department and the local bodies ministry, pointing out that every time the tallest Indian flag  visible from the Pakistan side  is torn and brought down, it brings embarrassment to all.The Punjab home department is still struggling to find out a solution for the repeated damage to the flag due to wind.
