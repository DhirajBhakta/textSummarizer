A stray dog mauled three students of the junior wing of Bal Bharti Public School in Brij Vihar, Ghaziabad, on Thursday afternoon. 
Members of the People for Animals (PFA) said they had picked up the stray dog and suspect it was suffering from rabies. 
It would be caged for a couple of days.The incident took place outside the school premises when the students were heading towards their transport vans after school. 
The dog attacked the three students and mauled them severely. 
Residents have often taken up the issue of stray dog menace with the corporation but have failed to yield desired results.
