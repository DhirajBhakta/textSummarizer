The opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) claimed on Monday that few Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) legislators cross-voted in favour of NDA candidate Ram Nath Kovind, which was a signal to the upheaval in the Arvind Kejriwal-led party. 
Gupta claimed that Kejriwal himself was annoyed with Congress and UPA leadership because they were never invited in the meetings to discuss the election.
