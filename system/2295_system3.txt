I feel humbled when a former India captain says something like that. 
I have not decided anything but if Indian cricket requires me, I will be always available. 
I have never shied away from responsibility, Thakur told PTI.Asked if he is a relieved man, Thakur said: I had complete faith in judiciary.The Hamirpur MP has been very busy with his political work as well as looking after other sporting activities.During all these months, I was busy doing what I love most -- promoting sports. 
I am also involved with Hockey Himachal as promoting Olympic sports in the state has been one of my prime endeavours, said Thakur. 
Also, I am the chairman of Parliamentary Committee on Information and Technology, my constituency work in Hamirpur -- I had a very busy six months, he said.Thakur, however, didnt wish to comment on the ongoing drama regarding appointment of chief coach and support staff.He doesnt want to talk on BCCIs internal matters and only twice has he aired his views on cricketing matters.The first time was when he supported Virat Kohli after the cheatgate incident during the home series against Australia and then when Kohli was being criticised after the infamous fallout with former coach Anil Kumble.
