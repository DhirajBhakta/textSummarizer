There is a saying in Bengali which, roughly translated, means that someone who has had a wood apple fall on their head never goes to the orchards again. 
At one point, Mannan stooped over at a green grocer's stall to check out some cucumbers when calamity fell upon him.Only the calamity here was a calf. 
A living and breathing, 85-kg calf that fell out of the sky and on Mannan while he was shopping.Well, not 'out of the sky' per say.
