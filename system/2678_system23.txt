Pakistan Cricket Board chief Shaharyar Khan has said India are scared of playing Pakistan after losing the Champions Trophy final at The Oval on June 18. 
After our win, we challenge India to come and play bilateral cricket with us. 
They say we'll play you in ICC matches but they won't play us otherwise," Shaharyar said at the Pakistani Prime Minister's reception of the Pakistan team.
