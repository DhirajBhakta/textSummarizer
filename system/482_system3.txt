You cant work alongside them if you dont talk.In his autobiography, Karan had said his nearly 25-year-long friendship with Kajol ended prior to the release of his and her actor-filmmaker husband Ajay Devgns films -- Ae Dil Hai Mushkil and Shivaay. 
Ajay had said nasty things to him before the release of films and so he vowed no matter what, shes out of my life, Karan wrote.When asked if she is open to work with Karan, Kajol says, Let me put it this way, I am not answering any questions on that particular point. 
If any of my other friends want to offer me a film Ill definitely do it.The 42-year-old actress says even now, working with people she is comfortable with plays a big part in choosing roles, and that was one of the reasons she gave her nod to upcoming Tamil film, VIP 2.
