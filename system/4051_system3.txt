DMK working president MK Stalin has alleged that the ruling AIADMK government has not shown any interest in the ongoing farmers' strike at the Jantar Mantar Delhi. 
Tamil Nadu farmers are protesting at the Jantar Mantar in the national capital from the last two weeks seeking drought-relief package. 
They also want the Centre to waive off the farmer loans.The farmers of Tamil Nadu had a rough season in 2016 and neighboring state Karnataka refused to share Cauvery river water even against the Supreme Court's orders. 
With less or no income, farmers' suicide increased and members of the farmers association went to Delhi to meet the concerned ministers with their plea. 
TWO WEEKS ON, PALANISWAMI SILENT ON FARMERS' ISSUEIt has been almost two weeks that the farmers are protesting at Jantar Manta but the state government led by Palanisamy has not yet reacted on the issue. 
It appears that they are worried more about the RK Nagar bypolls as the party's deputy general secretary TTV Dinakaran is contesting from the constituency.Irked by the state government's attitude, Stalin said, "The state government is worried more on how to distribute money to gain votes for the RK Nagar polls than about the farmers' protest in Delhi."
The DMK leader also claimed that during the budget session he had requested the 'benami' government to waive off the farmer loans citing that more than 200 farmers have died so far "but the government, running on the advise of a convict, didn't care much".UP, PUNJAB FARMERS EXTENDED SUPPORT"Farmers of Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Haryana have extended their support for Tamil farmers and met them. 
Even BJP minister from the state Pon Radhakrishnan met the farmers but our chief minister is least bothered. 
He is only concerned about segregating votes for a Foreign Exchange Regulation Act (FERA) convict in RK Nagar," Stalin said.Many even questioned how the ministers of the state had time to stay in Delhi to attain the twin leaf symbol but couldn't take time out to meet the farmers.
