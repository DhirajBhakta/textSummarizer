In a rare incident along the states coastline, a seven-and-a-half-foot-long  sperm whale washed ashore at Rajodi beach, Virar, around 3pm on Thursday.Though the state mangrove cell confirmed that it was a sperm whale, the officials are unclear whether it was a juvenile whale or a pygmy or a dwarf (subspecies). 
This species of whale has not washed ashore along the states coastline for more than a decade. 
This was the 15th case of dead marine animal carcass washing ashore along Mumbais beaches.
