Delhi Police have recovered the Nobel Peace Prize replica and other items stolen from Kailash Satyarthi's south Delhi house on February 7. 
Police recovered some stolen items from Sangam Vihar in Delhi and some from Ghaziabad's Khora colony.Three people, all from Sangam Vihar, have been arrested in connection with the robbery."
I thank the Delhi Police for the brilliant and speedy recovery of the items stolen from my residence and I hope that Nobel citation is recovered soon as well.
