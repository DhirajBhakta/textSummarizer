Although actor Kriti Sanon is just three films old, she has already been directed by some of the best filmmakers and co-starred with actors such as Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol. 
There were some low phases in my life; there were films offered by big banners, but they were not the best debut projects. 
So, I had to tell myself that I should be patient and good things will happen to me,? 
says Kriti, who was born and brought up in Delhi and shifted to Mumbai to try her luck in Bollywood.The actor, who turned 27 on Thursday, adds, ?
I think I did feel low, but at the same time, I did have people who believed in me a lot.
