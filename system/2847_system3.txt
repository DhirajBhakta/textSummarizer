The International Cricket Council (ICC) chief executives' committee has approved all recommendations made by the ICC cricket committee in May, which include the use of Decision Review System (DRS) in all T20I games and teams not losing a review when an LBW review comes back as Umpire's Call.This means that from October 1, teams will not lose a review for "umpire's call" verdicts under the DRS.The 80 over top-up of reviews in Test cricket has been removed. 
DRS, meanwhile, will now be used in the T20I format as well.The other changes approved by the committee include:- Bat size restrictionsIn order to restore the balance between bat and ball, the ICC approved recommendations relating to bat sizes.The Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) World Cricket Committee in Mumbai, which included Australian legend Ricky Ponting among other cricket luminaries and is chaired by former England captain Mike Brearley, last year suggested that size of a bat's edges and depths should be limited to 40 mm and 67 mm, respectively."
