But the Turkish president had already left and the coup attempt was eventually put down by civilians and security forces.Natos secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, used the first anniversary of Turkeys failed coup to warn that any attempt to undermine democracy in one of the blocs was unacceptable.Stoltenberg paid homage to about 250 people who lost their lives resisting the failed attempt, praising the Turkish people who took to the streets and stood up against this heinous act in defence of its elected government and democratic institutions.He said added: (I) still remember the shock I felt seeing the damage inflicted at the parliament building by the bombardments of the coup plotters.The Bosphorus Bridge, now called the 15 July Martyrs Bridge, was the scene of clashes between civilians and soldiers in tanks.
