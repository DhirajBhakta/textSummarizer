The Supreme Court on Thursday ordered one year in jail for city-based builder Gopal Ansal who with his elder brother, Sushil, owned a south Delhi cinema hall where a fire killed 59 people 20 years ago.Reviewing its 2015 judgment that saw the brothers, who owned Uphaar Cinema, being let off with a fine of Rs 30 crore each, the court said the jail term would act as a deterrent and serve larger public interest.
