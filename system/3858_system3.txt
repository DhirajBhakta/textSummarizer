AAP found ammunition to gun for the BJP on Monday after it emerged that the saffron party's Inderpuri candidate for this month's municipal polls, who was touted as a slum dweller and the face of the city's urban poor, happens to be a millionaire. 
Aam Aadmi Party spokesperson Dilip Pandey termed the BJP's support for the slum dwellers and residents of unauthorised colonies in Delhi "hypocrisy" and "fake". 
She disclosed that she owns two residential properties measuring 720 square feet and 553 square feet at Dasghara in Inderpuri whose market price is pegged at Rs 50 lakh and Rs 32 lakh, respectively. 
BJP leaders refused to comment on the assets declared by its candidate but said its pick was aimed at supporting the less-privileged. 
"While no other party has ever stood with the slum dwellers, the BJP is the only party to have chosen its candidate from the weaker sections.
