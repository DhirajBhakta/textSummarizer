Tokyo, Dec 26 (PTI) Scientists in Japan have developed a new urine-powered sensor that can alert caregivers when a diaper is wet and ready to be changed. 
A team from the Ritsumeikan University in Japan worked on the diaper for about five years, with the aim of caring for ageing patients suffering from urinary incontinence. 
They first developed a urine sensor too rigid to embed into a diaper. 
Flexible embeddable battery and sensor contain a chemical potentially unsafe for humans and their charging times varied. 
The new diaper sensors overcome all of those problems by using a urine-activated battery, Gizmodo reported.
