The International Court of Justice (ICJ) was last a battleground for India and Pakistan nearly 18 years ago when Islamabad sought its intervention over the shooting down of its naval aircraft.Tomorrow, the ICJ, which is the U.N.'
s principal judicial organ, is holding a public hearing at the Great Hall of Justice housed in the Peace Palace at The Hague in Netherlands where the two countries will be asked to present their case over the contentious Jadhav issue.India on May 8 moved a petition before the U.N. body to seek justice for Kulbhushan Jadhav, 46, alleging violation of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations by Pakistan after its 16 requests for consular access to the former naval officer was consistently denied.A Pakistani military court awarded death sentence to Jadhav last month for alleged espionage and subversive activities. 
The verdict was final and there was no appeal.The ICJ found that it has no jurisdiction to entertain the application filed by Pakistan on September 21, 1999.Public hearings in the case titled 'Aerial incident of August 10, 1999 (Pakistan vs India)' lasted four days ending April 6, 2000. 
The court has accepted all our contentions," he had said.Former supreme court judge B P Jeevan Reddy and Pakistan's former Attorney General Syed Sharifuddin Pirzada were co-opted into the bench as ad-hoc judges.ICJ RULES ON JUDGESAs per ICJ rules, when it does not include a judge possessing the nationality of the state party to a case, the state may appoint a person to sit as a judge ad-hoc for the purpose of the case.The court also recalled that its lack of jurisdiction does not relieve States of their obligation to settle their disputes by peaceful means.The choice of those means admittedly rests with the parties under Article 33 of the UN Charter, it said, adding, they are nonetheless under an obligation to seek such a settlement, and to do so in good faith in accordance with the Charter.As regards India and Pakistan, that obligation was restated more particularly in the Simla Accord of July 2, 1972.
