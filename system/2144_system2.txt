New Delhi, Dec 7 (PTI) Consumer sales have seen a 25-30 per cent hit in past few weeks due to twin impact of demonetisation and seasonal slowdown post Diwali, countrys third largest handset maker Micromax said today. 
While online sales suffered due to cash crunch in the aftermath of demonetisation, the companys supply chain saw a 15-18 per cent decline in sales in the last few weeks. 
However, Micromax said the impact on its sales was lower than that on the industry. 
Mobile phone industry body Indian Cellular Association has said sales have come down by 50 per cent due to cash crunch post demonetisation.
