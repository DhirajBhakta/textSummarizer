The Ladies Professional Golf Association (LPGA) has come in for stiff criticism after it introduced a new dress code that forbids female golfers from sporting plunging necklines, leggings or revealing skirts on the course.Initial reactions were overwhelmingly negative, with Teen Vogue accusing the governing body?
As of 17 July, the LPGA will crack down on athletic wear following a 2 July email to all players from LPGA player president Vicki Goetze-Ackerman, which detailed an extensive list of clothing that will no longer be allowed on course and at pro-am parties on the tour.Any transgression of the new code, as revealed in a report by Golf Digest, will result in a $1,000 fine for the first offence, with fines doubling for each subsequent breach.
