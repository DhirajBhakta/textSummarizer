And the veteran actor cant figure out why the film was initially denied certification by the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC), aka Censor Board. 
I think they have a problem with female sexuality being portrayed on screen. 
What the films success has done is that it has shown [the Censor Board] up, and what they thought about the film. 
I have seen the film twice, and its a wonderfully made film that talks about whats going on in society.
