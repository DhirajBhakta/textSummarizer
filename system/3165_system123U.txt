India today responded to Pakistan's provocation in Poonch and Nowshera sectors in Jammu and Kashmir by killing at least five Pakistan jawans and injuring six others in Bimber and Battal sectors. 
Sources in the Army told India Today that the firing was done in retaliation to Pakistan's constant violation of ceasefire along the Line of Control. 
Pakistan alleges that at least one civilian was killed and four others were injured in the Indian firing in Battal sector this morning.
