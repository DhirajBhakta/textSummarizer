Rumblings in the Aam Aadmi Party continue today with sacked Delhi Water Minister Kapil Mishra making a dramatic allegation, accusing Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal of corruption. 
Speaking to reporters at Rajghat today morning, Mishra claimed to have seen Kejriwal accept Rs 2 crore in cash from Delhi Health Minister Satyendra Kumar Jain. 
The allegations come just a day after Mishra was shunted out of the Arvind Kejriwal cabinet. 
?Meanwhile, the Aam Aadmi Party rubbished Mishra's claims, calling the allegations baseless and undeserving of a response.
