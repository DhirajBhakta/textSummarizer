Mumbai, Jun 5 (PTI) Tiger Shroff said if Nawazuddin Siddiqui, who is a powerhouse performer, starts dancing as well then other actors jobs will be in trouble. 
When asked how it was to dance on screen, Nawazuddin told reporters, "Initially I felt I was forced to do it, but I started enjoying dancing while doing the film... 
Nawazuddin, 43, said he has tried to match up the dancing skills of Tiger. 
"I cant be a dancing hero, but if I get a solo hero film Ill definitely do it but it shouldnt have dancing. 
I danced with a lot of difficulty and learnt a lot by observing Tigers dancing steps. 
I cant dance like him, but have tried to match him.
