The story is about a young man from the streets, called Munna, played by Tiger, who is a big fan of Michael Jackson. 
Munna teaches dancing to Mahinder Fauji, played by Nawazuddin, who is a gangster with dancing ambitions. 
Tiger, who was also present at the event, quickly added, "If he starts dancing too, humara kaam mushkil ho jayega (our jobs would be difficult). 
"I cant be a dancing hero, but if I get a solo hero film Ill definitely do it but it shouldnt have dancing. 
I danced with a lot of difficulty and learnt a lot by observing Tigers dancing steps.
