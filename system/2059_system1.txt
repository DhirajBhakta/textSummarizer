When a Flipkart delivery man arrived to deliver a smartphone to 22-year-old Varun Kumar, he was murdered. 
Nanjundaswamy, a Flipkart employee in Bengaluru, went to a gym to deliver a smartphone but Varun was apparently waiting there with a knife. 
Varun, a gym trainer, ordered the phone online and gave the gym as his address, but since he did not have Rs 11,999 for the Redmi Note 3, he decided to murder the delivery man. 
According to the police, Varun attacked 29-year-old Nanjundaswamy with an iron rod and a flower pot. 
Nanjundaswamy's family had filed a missing report after he did not return home for two days.After a few days, Bengaluru Police found the Flipkart delivery man's body in the basement of the building.
