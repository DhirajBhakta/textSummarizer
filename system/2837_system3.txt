New Delhi, Jun 26 (PTI) State-owned telecom corporation Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Ltd (MTNL) today said it expects to repay about Rs 125 crore of debt before June-end. 
The debt-laden company - which offers landline and mobile telephony services in Delhi and Mumbai areas - said it will be able to make the repayment due to "one of the public sector banks", a few days before the June-30 deadline. 
Earlier this month, Purwar - after a meeting with the IMG officials - told reporters that since government is the promoter of MTNL, it "should not be found wanting" in support with regard to its capital requirements.
