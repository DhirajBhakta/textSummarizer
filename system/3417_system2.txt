In fact, in most of the pictures, the Barfi! 
actor looks like a spitting image of Sanjay Dutt. 
However, director Rajkumar Hirani is unhappy that Ranbir's look got leaked.
?However, he is happy with the way the biopic is shaping up. 
"The pictures shouldn't have come out. 
We were shooting in Carter road (in Bandra, a suburb in Mumbai) so it came out. 
But I am very happy. 
The film is being made with a lot of happiness and when a film is made with happiness, it turns out good. 
Its a great story," he told PTI.
