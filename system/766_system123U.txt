EasyJet has opened an investigation after an unaccompanied child was removed from an overbooked flight from London Gatwick.The 15-year-old was taken from his seat on flight EZY8333 to Toulouse on Thursday morning, and left alone at the departure gate. 
Reads grandparents had already embarked on the two-hour round trip to Toulouse from their home to meet him.Eventually, Portal persuaded easyJet to allocate her son a seat on the final departure of the day to Toulouse, although she said the airlines system apparently showed all four flights on Thursday were overbooked.The final flight, scheduled to depart at 6.40pm, was delayed by almost three hours, meaning Read finally arrived in Toulouse well after midnight.Portal said: Its crazy.
