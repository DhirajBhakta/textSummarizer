Former Aam Aadmi Party leader and a close aide of partys national convener Arvind Kejriwal, Mayank Gandhi has slammed the Delhi CM in an open letter on Wednesday as the BJP looked set to complete hat-trick of its rule in the three MCDs.The results of the MCD elections were announced on Wednesday with the AAP facing a rout. 
In his place was a politician who wanted to manipulate that support to fuel his ambition to become a PM in 2019, Gandhi wrote, referring to direction AAP took after the unprecedented win in the 2015 assembly elections.We have out beaten other parties with our arrogance and internal politicking, Gandhi wrote.You took complete power by becoming convener as well as CM of Delhi. 
As Ashutosh told me  there should be one voice only in the party and anyone opposing should be dealt in a manner that would give a message that this party deals summarily with anyone who opposes the supremo.As a part of the above strategy, you began by removing Yogendra and Prashant from the party with the worst possible humiliation.When I was told that there was a gag order on informing the volunteers outside, I asked myself, What would the real Arvind Kejriwal have done He would have listened to his conscience.
