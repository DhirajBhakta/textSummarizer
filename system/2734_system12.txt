Prime Minister Narendra Modi's stern warning to self-proclaimed cow vigilantes seems to have fallen on deaf ears as a group of men attacked a truck drivers transporting cows in Guwahati. 
The men then brutally thrashed the drivers accusing them of cow smuggling.A Hindu Yuva Chhatra Parishad leader Bikash Bordoloi said, "These people smuggle cattle across the border to Bangladesh. 
PM Modi's remarks came amid a spurt of attacks by cow vigilantes and a wave of protests.Delivering a speech to mark the centenary of the Sabarmati ashram in Ahmedabad and 150th birth anniversary of Shrimad Rajchandraji, a guru to Mahatma Gandhi, Modi said unleashing violence against others went against the ideals of the Father of the Nation."
