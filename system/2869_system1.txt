Sanoj Yadav's Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) comradeship of 30 years failed to wane Bihar Health Minister Tej Pratap's ire towards him who thrashed him brutally in a party on Friday. 
He was also aghast at Lalu Yadav's inaction to control his son.Speaking to India Today, Sanoj said, "I have been a loyal worker of the party for last 30 years and today I have been humiliated by Lalu's son in such a manner that I am completely shattered." 
Now I fear for my life from Tej Pratap Yadav and therefore I am appealing Chief Minister Nitish Kumar to take action against him and sack him from his cabinet", said Sanoj Yadav.Also read: Bihar ki beti will lose presidential election: Nitish on Meira Kumar
