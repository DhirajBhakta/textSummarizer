India's digital warriors have crippled 30 Pakistan government websites in virtual surgical strikes as protest against the neighbouring country's announcement of the death penalty to former Navy officer Kulbhushan Jadhav.A Pakistani military court this month ordered the punishment for Jadhav, after he was accused of espionage and sabotage activities in Karachi and Balochistan."
State police websites were defaced by Pakistani hackers where they posted anti-India comments with an image of the Pakistan flag.Experts say the intelligence-gathering process has intensified as hackers are not only defacing the sites but are silently spying into critical networks.Kulbhushan Jadhav was arrested reportedly from Balochistan after he entered Pakistan from Iran.
