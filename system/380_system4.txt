said Das.Construction of the gates, which would require cutting of border fencing between both countries at some points, is expected to be over before the 3rd round of the dialogue on the issue in Dhaka next year.Both countries also agreed to discourage and regulate construction of electric fences to protect crops in the areas which fall in the routes taken by the elephants to prevent deaths due to electrocution.Measures to prevent or bring down incidents of human-elephant conflict while the pachyderms crisscross between both countries, such as setting up warning systems and planting of trees to act as bio-fence, were also discussed.There are nearly 9,000 wild elephants in the northeast region, around 1800 of them in Meghalaya alone, and sometimes they venture to Bangladesh in search of food or mates.Last year, a wild elephant was swept away to Bangladesh by the flooded waters of Brahmaputra from Dhubri in Assam.
