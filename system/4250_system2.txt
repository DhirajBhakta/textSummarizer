New Delhi, Mar 14 (PTI) The RBI today told the Delhi High Court that it wants to take a fresh look into the USD 1.17 billion arbitral award granted in favour of Japanese telecom major NTT Docomo for Tata Sons alleged breach of its agreement. 
It might be better to tell the court, whether there is any statutory provision or regulation barring transfer of money overseas under the award," the judge said. 
The court also said that "in every private award, RBI cannot step in" and gave the bank time till tomorrow to show the rule, regulation or circular which comes in the way of implementation of the award. 
Senior advocate Soli Sorabjee, appearing for the RBI, told the court that the bank would not press its application to intervene in the matter if it can take a fresh look into the award granted in favour of Docomo. 
They said that on March 8, the court had asked RBI to make its stand clear by showing the rule, regulation or circular under which the banks permission is required before transfer of money overseas under the award. 
The lawyers for the two companies said that the RBI cannot keep it open ended by looking into afresh.
