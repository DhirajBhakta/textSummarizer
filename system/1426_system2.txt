The BJP today once again raked up the contentious Ram temple issue ahead of the first phase of the crucial seven-phase Uttar Pradesh election starting February 11.The party said a "grand" temple will be built in Ayodhya if the party comes to power with clear majority in India's most populous state."
Ram Mandir is a subject of faith. 
It is not going to be built in two months. 
The temple will be constructed after the elections. 
After the Modi government took over, we hoped that now the temple would be constructed. 
Modi must visit Ayodhya, give us a guarantee and announce that that he will get the Ram temple constructed during his tenure," Acharya Satyendra Das said.
