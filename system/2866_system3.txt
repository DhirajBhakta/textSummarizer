Washington, Jun 24 (PTI) Your brain power may be significantly reduced when your smartphone is within reach - even if it is switched off - affecting your ability to concentrate on a task, scientists have found. 
The tests were geared to measure participants available cognitive capacity - that is, the brains ability to hold and process data at any given time. 
The researchers found that participants with their phones in another room significantly outperformed those with their phones on the desk, and they also slightly outperformed those participants who had kept their phones in a pocket or bag. 
The findings suggest that the mere presence of ones smartphone reduces available cognitive capacity and impairs cognitive functioning, even though people feel they are giving their full attention and focus to the task at hand. 
"We see a linear trend that suggests that as the smartphone becomes more noticeable, participants available cognitive capacity decreases," said Adrian Ward, Assistant Professor at University of Texas at Austin. 
In another experiment, researchers looked at how a persons self-reported smartphone dependence - or how strongly a person feels he or she needs to have a smartphone in order to get through a typical day - affected cognitive capacity. 
Participants performed the same series of computer-based tests as the first group and were randomly assigned to keep their smartphones either in sight on the desk face up, in a pocket or bag, or in another room.
