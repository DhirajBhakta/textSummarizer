The tests were geared to measure participants available cognitive capacity - that is, the brains ability to hold and process data at any given time. 
Before beginning, participants were randomly instructed to place their smartphones either on the desk face down, in their pocket or personal bag, or in another room. 
"We see a linear trend that suggests that as the smartphone becomes more noticeable, participants available cognitive capacity decreases," said Adrian Ward, Assistant Professor at University of Texas at Austin. 
Participants performed the same series of computer-based tests as the first group and were randomly assigned to keep their smartphones either in sight on the desk face up, in a pocket or bag, or in another room. 
The researchers found that participants who were the most dependent on their smartphones performed worse compared with their less-dependent peers, but only when they kept their smartphones on the desk or in their pocket or bag.
