Tomas Berdych looks rather sheepish after, er, claiming his, er, third ever win over Novak Djokovic. 
Back on Centre Court, Milos Raonic has held and lost three break points in the eighth game of the third set. 
Still, hes dropping his forehands very short today and thats asking for it against Federer, whos giving it the treatment.
Another singing crosscourt backhand does the job as Raonic stretches and plants a volley wide for Federer to break again and lead 6-4, 4-1.
