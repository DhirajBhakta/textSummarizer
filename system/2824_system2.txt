The state government has given all permissions necessary for a revamped Kerala Boat Race League (KBL) to take place this season. 
So far, however, only snake boats, which are known as "vallam kali", have been allowed to be a part of the league. 
Other traditional boat races will take place outside the league."
Only snake boats will be allowed to participate in the KBL. 
The competitions of small boats will be held as usual. 
We hope that from next year, KBL will get many more sponsors," A TOI report quotes Finance minister T M Thomas Isaac."
The nine snake boats, which come in the last leg of NTBR, will qualify for the other eight competitions in the league.
