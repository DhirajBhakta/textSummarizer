Passengers delaying flights beyond two hours in an air rage could be fined Rs 15 lakh, says national carrier Air Indias proposed set of standard operating procedures to tackle unruly flyers.The draft SOPs detail steps for the crew and ground staff in the event of ugly incidents such as two recent controversies involving parliamentarians Ravindra Gaikwad of the Shiv Sena and Trinamool Congresss Dola Sen.Gaikwad was banned from flying by six airlines after he assaulted a senior Air India official with his slippers, allegedly angry over the state-run carrier shifting him from business class to economy on a Pune-New Delhi flight this March. 
Further, recent incidents have revealed that unruly behaviour does not require any provocation, the proposal says.Hundreds of flyers  mostly drunk, petulant or arrogant  have been grounded, blacklisted, arrested, fined and imprisoned for their aggressive behaviour since aviation became an accessible and favoured mode of transport around the world.Last December, a Citibank vice-president and his girlfriend were arrested in America for fighting with the flight crew and fellow passengers.Back home, a police complaint was lodged against Gaikwad, the Sena MP for Osmanabad, who had bragged before television camera that he hit the Air India employee with his slippers 25 times.Air India retaliated by blocking seven attempts he made to book a ticket, changing the spelling of his surname and using prefixes such as Prof.
