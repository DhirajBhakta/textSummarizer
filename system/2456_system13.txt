The extension is being planned to provide connectivity up to south Mumbai via port land, which is going to be developed as a second Marine Drive by MbPT.The south Mumbai extension will be partially underground. 
MbPT has conveyed to the MMRDA that it would like an underground line, but the final decision will be taken once the report is out, said a senior official.Officials added MbPT will share the project cost as the extension would help them get footfalls when port trust land is developed commercially.
