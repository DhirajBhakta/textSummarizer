Beijing, Jun 9 (PTI) Fossils of a completely preserved crocodile and bones belonging to at least six different dinosaurs, dating back 145 to 66 million years, have been unearthed in northeast China. 
The fossil was well preserved from head to tail, with clear skin, which is quite rare among Cretaceous strata findings in China, they said. 
"Crocodiles and dinosaurs lived together, which means there are probably more fossils buried underneath," said Jin Changzhu, a research fellow at the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology.
