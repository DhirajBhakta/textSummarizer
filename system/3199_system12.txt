So we are not bound to follow the other instructions," ANI quoted Biswas.Seeking an end to VIP culture, the Centre last month took a decision against using red beacons.Following the amendment, which was effective from May 1, no official, whether from the Centre or a state, is to be allowed to use red beacons.Only vehicles of emergency services such as fire brigade and ambulances are exempted from the new rule and allowed to use blue beacons.The Centre has allowed emergency vehicles on duty for maintaining law and order, to use multi-coloured beacon lights having red, blue and white colours.The notification issued in pursuance of powers conferred on the Central Government under sub-rule 4 of rule 108 of the Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989 said that the multi-coloured light shall not be put to use when the vehicle is not on the designated duty.Only five categories of people are exempt from the new rule - the President of India, the Vice President of India, the Prime Minister of India, the Speaker of the Lok Sabha and the Chief Justice of India.
