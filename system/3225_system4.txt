But I assure you criminals won't go scott free," minister Suresh Khanna said.The minister made the statement hours after four women were allegedly gang-raped and a man was shot dead by a group of armed criminals on the Jewar-Bulandshahr highway.Khanna's statement is likely to trigger a row as the Opposition is already criticising the Yogi Adityanath government over its failure to control communal clashes in Saharanpur.
?The incident, which is a horrific reminder of last year's Bulandshahr gangrape, took place near Sabota village in Jewar around 1.40 am when the eight people were going to visit a relative undergoing treatment at a hospital in Bulandshahr in western Uttar Pradesh.SSP, Gautam Budh Nagar, Love Kumar said a gang of five robbers targeted the vehicle after the driver stopped it near a roadside hut to fix a flat tyre.The occupants were attacked and, along with an old man who was in the hut, taken to a nearby field.
