The veteran actor is producing a web series based on the India-Pakistan War of 1971. 
"Because of Netflix we are working on a web series which is based on a real life incident. 
We have a Canadian and an Indian writer working on the script. 
I dont know if I will act or not as it depends on the demand of the script," Kher told PTI.
