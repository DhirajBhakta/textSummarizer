An 11-year-old student committed suicide by jumping off the second floor of his school building in Karimnagar district of Telangana ostensibly after failing to cope with parental pressure to study IIT foundation course. 
But later changed their version in the complaint lodged with the police stating that their son was mentally disturbed.However, students unions in Karimnagar town staged a dharna in front of the government hospital, where the body was shifted for post mortem, and demanded action against the school management.This is the second such incident in Telangana this week.
