From Yoshita Singh New York, Feb 12 (PTI) Microsoft has to "look like everyone and every organisation in the world" for it to accomplish its mission, the technology giants Indian-born CEO Satya Nadella has said, asserting the importance of "diversity and inclusion" amid an environment of divisiveness. 
That means we have got to look like everyone and every organisation in the world," Nadella said during an interaction with students and faculty at New York Universitys Tandon School of Engineering and the Stern School of Business last week. 
It obviously starts by having a workforce that is diverse but inclusion is a cultural piece that we all have to work on everyday," he said at the interaction during his visit to the University on February 7. 
He said inclusion "shows up in every meeting, starting with me."
