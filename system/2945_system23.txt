Rashid Latif has extended a hand of friendship towards Virender Sehwag after his tirade on social media created a storm in India. 
While Sehwag had chosen to maintain a dignified silence, India cricketer Manoj Tiwary posted a video with a like-for-like response to Latif. 
However, Pakistan came back strongly from their dismal start to first storm into the final and then defeating India, the pre-tournament favourites.
