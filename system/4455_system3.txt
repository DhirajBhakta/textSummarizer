Both chambers would have to agree to an appointment or a resolution, giving the political representatives a veto over decisions made by the judicial members.The governments proposals will be an instrument for ensuring the appointment of the right kind of judges who will not be too critical of the authorities and their political programme, said Ewa towska, a professor at Polands Institute of Legal Sciences and a former judge who served on the countrys constitutional tribunal and the supreme administrative court.The council was given less than three working days to respond to the draft act, receiving it from the Ministry of Justice on a Thursday and expected to provide its official response by the following Tuesday. 
It must be recalled that in accordance with article 8(1) of the constitution, it is the constitution of the Republic of Poland of 2 April 1997 that is the supreme law in the Republic of Poland, and not the constitution of Spain of 31 October 1978 or the basic law of the Federal Republic of Germany of 23 May 1949.The controversy is the latest front in a protracted battle between the PiS and an increasingly demoralised judiciary.Shortly after assuming power in late 2015, the government merged the office of prosecutor general with that of the justice minister, Zbigniew Ziobro, a move that some analysts argue has already allowed the government to exert political pressure on judges.We have already seen numerous examples of prosecutors answerable to the minister of justice initiating criminal proceedings against judges who have reached decisions they dont agree with, said towska.
