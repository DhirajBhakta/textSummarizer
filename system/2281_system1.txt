Unfortunately the chap on the other side of the net is not making this any easier, making it deuce with a searing crosscourt backhand, earning a break point when Cilic nets a forehand. 
First set: Cilic 1-1 Federer* (*denotes server): We begin with a see-saw rally, Federer on top at first and making most of the running before Cilic takes control with a big forehand down the line, forcing the Swiss to net a backhand.
