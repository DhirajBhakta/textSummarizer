Not just doc, ppt, pdf, docx file types,? WhatsApp will soon allow you to share all file types on the chat platform. 
By all file types, we are talking about file formats like apk, mp3, zip and similarly more. 
This update will shorten the process of exchanging large size files by simply attaching them within chat.The process of attachment is expected to be similar to how we send other files on chat app now which is using the paper clip icon seen within the app. 
This means you can share files and videos without any compression, thus, retaining the original quality of the photos and videos.
