Captioned 'Brothers-in-arms for peace', the picture tweeted by the official CRPF handle on Saturday has Twitterati swooning over the humble comradery of two officers. 
The picture shows, presumably a Hindu CRPF officer standing guard for his fellow Muslim officer while he offers namaz during duty hours. 
The post went viral for all right reasons, with people hailing the harmonious sociability, religious coexistence and brotherhood between the two CRPF officers. heart filled with joy after seeing this pic...jai hind brothers ????
The post sits atop the garb of how Kashmir is polarised on religious lines- with a Hindu cop shielding his Muslim colleague while the latter offers his prayers.
