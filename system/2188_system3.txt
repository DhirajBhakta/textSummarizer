More than 80,000 children under the age of five living in majority-Muslim areas of western Myanmar are wasting and will need treatment for acute malnutrition over the next year, the World Food Programme has warned.The report from the United Nations agency was based on an assessment of villages in western Rakhine state, where some 75,000 stateless Muslim Rohingya people have fled a bloody army crackdown.Those who remain are now reeling from a food crisis, with WFP finding one-third of homes are experiencing extreme food deprivation in Maungdaw, one district particularly affected by the violence. 
These households had the highest frequency of episodes of severe hunger, WFP said.No children under the age of two met minimum adequate diet requirements, the assessment found, while 225,000 people need humanitarian assistance.It is estimated that 80,500 children under the age of five are expected to be in need of treatment for acute malnutrition over the next twelve months, the WFP report said. 
A WFP spokesperson in Myanmar said this wasting  condition of rapid weight lose that can become fatal  impairs the functioning of the immune system.The survey has confirmed a worsening of the food security situation in already highly vulnerable areas following the security incidents and ensuing violence in late 2016, the WFP report said.In October last year, Rohingya militant attacks on border police sparked army retaliation in which government forces have used helicopters to attack villages.The countrys de-facto leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, who was awarded the Nobel peace prize in 1991, has been criticised by more than a dozen fellow laureates for the armed response.
