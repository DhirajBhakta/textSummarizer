Speaking about the incident, Deputy Commissioner of Police MN Anucheth said, "Film director Madan and his four accomplices Chalapathy, Kiran, Murthy and Mohan, aged 25-40 years, were arrested on Friday on the charge of abducting Paramesh, owner of Ravi Akshay Ad Agency, who was paid Rs 16.3 lakh for promoting his Kannada film Eradu Kanasu through advertisements."
As the latter was avoiding the director, the other four accused were sent to meet the victim on the pretext of discussing the issue and kidnapped him on Wednesday," said Anucheth.Madan later called Paramesh's family and demanded a ransom.
