?After realising that Mane had gone missing, his friends informed others including Thermax workers union president who in turn asked his friend Sachin Gaikwad  for help. 
I told them to contact Velha police station and register a complaint and meanwhile, I called my friend Sachin Gaikwad who is known for rescue missions. 
He immediately responded and reached Velha in the middle of the night, said Dinesh Dakhave, Thermax workers union president.
