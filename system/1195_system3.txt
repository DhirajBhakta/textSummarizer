(SCORECARD)Ashwin, who completed a milestone of fastest 250 Test wickets, bowled much better in the second innings which Pujara attributed to a different role of a "restrictive bowler" that he essayed in the first innings of Bangladesh. 
(One-off Test: Bangladesh left with 7 wickets to survive after Ashwin, Jadeja strike)"Probably, he (Ashwin) is the toughest spinner when it comes to any opposition team. 
(Good to have 250 Test wickets record out of the way: Ravichandran Ashwin)In the first innings, Ashwin went for nearly 100 runs getting two wickets but Pujara said that he was given a restrictive role. 
(DAY 4 HIGHLIGHTS)"He (Ashwin) understands that there are situations where he has to bowl tightly. 
Ashwin is the one who takes wickets and Jadeja plays the role of a holding batsman.
