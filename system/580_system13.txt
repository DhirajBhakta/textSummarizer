So, we have decided to appoint a contractor who will install the charging points at the selected parking lots, collect a minimal amount from e-rickshaws and allow them to charge their vehicles here, said Praveen Gupta, commissioner, North MCD.The contractor will also be responsible for maintaining the law and order situation at these places during the night when the e-rickshaws will be charged.According to Gupta, there are various reasons for starting the facility at selected parking lots .We are choosing locations which are close to internal/arterial roads and far from the main stretches in city.
