The CM has desired that no red carpets, special towels or particular sofa be arranged during his visits,? 
Saurabh, the son of the martyr, said.Last month, a storm of criticism was unleashed after the administration made similar arrangements for another visit in Deoria but took back the air conditioner and sofa from the family of another slain soldier after Adityanath left the premises. 
s written orders, communicated to all commissioners, district magistrates and district police chiefs, have made a specific mention of the Deoria visit.?
The official said Adityanath has also asked the party cadre to do away with the practice of welcoming him with bouquets and garlands during his outstation visits.?
