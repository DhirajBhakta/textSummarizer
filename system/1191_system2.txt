The state is in talks with a Holland-based company to set up smogfree towers in Gurugram and Faridabad, the two districts adjoining the national Capital that contribute to nearly one-fifth of air pollution in the region. 
The National Green Tribunal too has raised concerns about the perennial smog blanket every winter all over the NCR and advised the states to thrash out a joint action plan to minimize Delhi's air pollution levels. 
Crop burning in fields of Haryana and Punjab contribute significantly to rising Delhi's air pollution levels. 
But with local politics involved, an immediate step is unlikely soon, hinted officials adding, "but we are putting up 19 ambient air quality monitors to assess the peak pollution time causing the rise in Delhi's air pollution levels".
