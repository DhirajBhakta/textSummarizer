The characters jumping on the judge's dais and fighting in court shows mockery of the court.Waghmare had formed his opinion after watching the trailers. 
The bench, consisting of justices VM Kanade and Sangitrao Patil said, "We have seen? the photographs; one of which shows a lawyer jumping on the dais and arguing with the judge. 
With this, the court felt that "prima facie, though the above referred photographs do indicate total disrespect or disregard to the high office of this court, we cannot jump to that conclusion unless the contexts in which these scenes are shown, are examined in their proper perspective".Thus, the court felt that it is necessary to appoint a committee as amicus curiae to watch the film and submit a report.
