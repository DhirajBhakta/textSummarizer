The Maharashtra government will initiate a probe into the delay in declaration of results of the examinations conducted by the Mumbai University (MU), state education minister Vinod Tawde said on Wednesday.The ruling BJPs ally Shiv Sena had on Monday sought the resignation of Tawde and Mumbai University vice chancellor Sanjay Deshmukh over the mess in the universitys online assessment process, leading to delay in declaration of results.It is obvious that we will inquire into the delay in the result process when a large number of students have been affected, Tawde said in the state Legislative Council.He was responding to the demand by Shiv Sena members Anil Parab and Neelam Gorhe that the vice chancellor resign for delay in the checking of examination papers.Tawde said the government will inform Governor C Vidyasagar Rao, who is the chancellor of all universities in the state, about the views expressed by members of the House.The correct way of taking action would be through the governor.
