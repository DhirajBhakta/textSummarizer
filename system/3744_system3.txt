Art of Living founder Sri Sri Ravi Shankar on Tuesday said the Centre, Delhi government and the National Green Tribunal (NGT) should be held responsible for allowing his foundation to organise the World Culture Festival on the Yamuna floodplains in March 2016  if any environmental damage was caused.If, at all, any fine has to be levied, it should be levied on the Central and state governments and the NGT itself, for giving the permission. 
The tribunal had allowed the festival on March 11-13, 2016, saying that as the matter was fait accompli, they could not ban it. 
The three-day World Cultural Festival of Art of Living soon grabbed headlines for allegedly polluting and harming the ecosystems at the Yamuna floodplains.An interim environment compensation of Rs5 crore was imposed on the foundation for its alleged environment damaging activities by the NGT while efforts were made to ascertain the exact cost of the damage.World over, cultural programmes are held on riverbanks.
