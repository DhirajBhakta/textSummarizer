FIFA is set to shift India's Under-17 World Cup matches from Mumbai to the national capital Delhi as the apex soccer body has taken the host governments request "very seriously". 
The All India Football Federation (AIFF) initially wanted Mumbai to host India's home matches but later asked FIFA to shift them to Delhi due to pressure from the sports ministry as it felt it was appropriate that the capital hosts the home teams games. 
Asked if they have finalised on shifting India's round robin matches from Mumbai to Delhi, FIFAs head of events Jaime Yarza told PTI, "We are working on the most beneficial decision for the tournament. 
Navi Mumbai was originally scheduled to host Group A matches but the AIFFs request means Delhi could now host those while Navi Mumbai will have to settle for Group B games.
