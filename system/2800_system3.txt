The All India Football Federation (AIFF) initially wanted Mumbai to host India's home matches but later asked FIFA to shift them to Delhi due to pressure from the sports ministry as it felt it was appropriate that the capital hosts the home teams games. 
Asked if they have finalised on shifting India's round robin matches from Mumbai to Delhi, FIFAs head of events Jaime Yarza told PTI, "We are working on the most beneficial decision for the tournament. 
A source, in the know of the developments, said FIFA is "very close" to shift the matches.
