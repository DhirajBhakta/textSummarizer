In fact, Salman was one of the co-producers of Isabel's debut film, and had even said that she was more talented than Kat.However, Mumbai Mirror quotes a source as saying, "Katrina and Salman discuss films extensively and are like family to each other. 
She has shown interest in venturing into film production soon while simultaneously balancing her acting gigs and has been reading scripts, discussing films with her close director friends as well.
