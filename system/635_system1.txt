The bears have been reintroduced to the mountain region over the past three decades after being wiped out by hunters.The sheep, which belonged to a farmer in Couflens, south-west France, are thought to have taken fright when the bear appeared in the area last Sunday.After the predator attacked one of the sheep, 209 others in the flock panicked and hurled themselves off a 200 metre-high cliff on the border between France and Spain. 
The other dead animals were found in France.The Spanish news agency Europa Press said bear fur had been found on one of the dead sheep and would be analysed to try to establish exactly what had happened.Although the French government will compensate the farmer for his loss, the incident has provoked an angry response from the local branch of the French farmers?
