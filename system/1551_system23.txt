Thanjavur, Jan 16 (PTI) M Natarajan, husband of AIADMK general secretary V K Sasikala, tonight accused "some sections" in the BJP of trying to split the AIADMK and get the state government dismissed. 
"We will not allow such conspiracies to succeed...I will face the challenge squarely...I am willing to come anywhere single-handedly, to Gujarat, to UP, anywhere," he said while addressing the valedictory session of the three-day Thamizhar Kalai Ilakkiya Pongal Thiruvizha (Tamil art and literary Pongal festival) here.
