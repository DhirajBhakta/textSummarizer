A Pakistani fellow stepped into the lion's den after he took an uncalled-for dig at Shah Rukh Khan after Pakistan's ICC Champions Trophy 2017 victory.Twitter user @iUsmanJameel, while sharing celebratory pictures of Pakistan Captain Sarfraz Ahmed being welcomed back home, tweeted "SRK who".SRK who pic.twitter.com/900UKZKdyCThe attempt was to compare Ahmed's fame to that of Shah Rukh Khan's and Usman supported the comparison sharing a few photos of crowds cheering the cricketer back home.This comparison did not sit well with Shah Rukh Khan fans, not even with those from Pakistan, as they soon came to his rescue.Never repeat but for Shahrukh it's a routine.
