"For the first time, two new roses named after President Pranab Mukherjee and his wife late Suvra Mukherjee have been put on display. 
The special roses are developed by plant breeders from Pushpanjali rose nursery, Jakpur, West Bengal. 
The India Rose Federation approved the same and released the varieties in January during a rose show in West Bengal," Secretary to the President, Venu Rajamony, said.
