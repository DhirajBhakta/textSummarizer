DMRC official said that notification of Ministry of Urban Development on changes in Transit Oriented Development Policy (TOD) policy has also paved way for vertical growth along the Delhi Metro corridor, which will eventually help them to use more space for commercial purpose.Under the TOD policy, a Floor Area Ratio (FAR) of 400 has been approved. 
This will enable high rises to come up in these areas and make for denser colonies.
