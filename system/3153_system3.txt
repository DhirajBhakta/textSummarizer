One of the biggest box-office clashes of 2017 got averted when Rajkumar Hirani decided to postpone the release of Sanjay Dutt biopic. 
Earlier the film was supposed to clash with Salman Khan and Katrina Kaif-starrer Tiger Zinda Hai. 
Trade Analyst Taran Adarsh took to Twitter to confirm the news and revealed that the Dutt biopic will now release on March 30, 2018.
A source was quoted as telling Deccan Chronicle, "This biopic is one of the most awaited films in recent times. 
We know Salman has a huge fan following, so it only made business sense to avoid the on-screen clash."
