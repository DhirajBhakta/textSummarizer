Kerala is among the few places in India that place no restrictions on the consumption of cow meat.While most other BJP-led governments have been unequivocal in their support to measures that ban the sale and consumption of cow meat, one of the party's candidates in Kerala is making headlines for luring voters with the promise of "good beef" if elected. 
'The BJP's hypocrisy is that cow is mummy in Uttar Pradesh and yummy in the Northeast," Owaisi said.His comments were in reaction the Yogi Adityanath government's drive to strictly enforce Uttar Pradesh's ban on cow slaughter, even as a BJP member in Nagaland said that a ban on beef like the one in UP would not be enacted in the north-eastern state if the party came to power.
