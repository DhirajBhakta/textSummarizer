She added, "I don't say doctors don't commit mistakes but, there are complications due to which patients lose their life. 
Every case cannot be due to negligence. 
And even if there is negligence there are redressal forums for it."
Pophale pointed out to the court that the doctors are not on strike but only on mass leave and as an association, they have been telling the doctors not to do so. 
He, however, added that the state has done little to protect the doctors. 
But Chief Justice Chellur was of the opinion that the resident doctors cannot put the public at large in trouble. 
"If you (resident doctors) think being a doctor you can behave like a factory worker, then you are unfit to serve as a doctor. 
It's a shame. 
How can you (resident doctors) say first provide security only then we will work" asked Chief Justice Chellur.NEXT HEARING TOMORROWWith this, the Bombay High Court ordered the striking resident doctors to join work or face action by the management. 
It said that the management is free to initiate action and contempt proceedings against the striking doctors. 
The next hearing of the case is on March 22.After the Bombay High Court issued the order, Naresh Kabra, a resident doctor at Sion Hospital present at the hearing, said, "We are not super humans either. 
Patients verbally abuse us almost every day but we don't say anything. 
It's only when we are physically beaten up that we have protested.
