Following tradition, outgoing US President Barack Obama and his family will board the Air Force One for the final time as they fly to Palm Springs in California for a vacation after US President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration on January 20. 
"The first family is looking forward to flying to Palm Springs, California on Friday. 
The President vowed to take his family to a destination that is warmer than Washington DC on Friday and Palm Springs fits the bill," White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters on Tuesday. 
He and his family have enjoyed the time they've spent there in the past," he said.
