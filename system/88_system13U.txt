Scores of easyJet passengers were stranded on the Greek island of Zakynthos (also known as Zante) after their plane developed technical difficulties and a replacement aircraft was prevented from flying in because of mating turtles. 
She said that while her familys travel agents helped them find accommodation and taxis, other passengers were left to fend for themselves.  
The airline said the night curfew  apparently in place because of vulnerable loggerhead turtles breeding nearby  had prevented an alternative aircraft being sent out.
