Neuberger said: I have had the pleasure of working closely with Lady Hale over the last five years, and have seen at first hand the intellect and humanity with which she approaches the appeals which come before her, as well as her commitment to the rule of law, legal education and building public understanding of the work of the courts.For Lady Hale to become president of the institution to which she has contributed so much is a fitting pinnacle to a truly ground-breaking career.Hale has criticised the inbuilt bias in choosing judges, and the dependence on soundings from judges, as producing a judiciary that is not only mainly male, overwhelmingly white, but also largely the product of a limited range of educational institutions and social backgrounds.Born in Yorkshire in 1945, she went to a state school, Richmond high school for girls, and then to Girton College, Cambridge, where she read law and graduated top of her class.Hales career began in academia when she joined the University of Manchester law faculty as a junior lecturer.
