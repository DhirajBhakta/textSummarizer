I dont think there is a need for a separate law, Ahir said.The minister was responding to a supplementary question by Congress leader Digvijaya Singh, who asked if the central government was planning to modify the CrPC and IPC to deal with mob lynching in the name of cow protection which he said was emerging as a trend now.The minister said the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) does not maintain a separate data of killings in the name of cow protection.Stressing that law and order was a state subject, Ahir said Home Minister Rajnath Singh had already issued an advisory to all the states to take prompt action in cases of cow vigilantism and nab the culprits.Samajwadi Party leader Naresh Agrawal, who had asked the primary question on cow vigilantism, accused BJP people of involvement in such incidents.
