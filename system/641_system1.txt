After announcing free phones, Reliance Jio now wants to provide free Wi-Fi to three crore college students across the country. 
According to sources in the government, the company has submitted a proposal in this regard to the human resource development (HRD) ministry. 
Sources further said that the proposal is being examined by the ministry and a final decision is yet to be taken. 
However, officials said any such proposal will have to go through a transparent tender process.
