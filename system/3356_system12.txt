In the last few months, Indias pervasive culture of privilege has got a sound beating: In March, Ravindra Gaikwad, an MP, hit a 60-year-old Air India (AI) employee with a slipper and soon found himself on a no-fly list. 
Air India has a subsidiary called AI-SATS, a ground handling agency, which provides end-to-end services such as passenger and baggage handling. 
While such changes are fine and make for good optics, there are so many things that the AI needs to fix and, hopefully, those will also get adequate attention.
