Suffocating summer heat has followed two years of lower-than-average rainfall in Rome, forcing the Italian capital to close drinking fountains and consider the prospect of water rationing.More than a million residents of Rome are facing water rationing for up to eight hours a day as the prolonged heatwave that has ravaged southern Europe takes its toll. 
Vatican spokesman Greg Burke said it was the first time authorities in the spiritual home of the worlds 1.2 billion Catholics could remember being forced to turn off the fountains. 
Standing in St Peters Square, where two fountains by 17th-century sculptors Carlo Maderno and Gian Lorenzo Bernini stood dry, Burke said the Vatican wanted to help. 
This is the Vaticans way of living in solidarity with Rome, trying to help Rome get through this crisis, he told Reuters TV.The measure was initiated on Monday, and all 100 Vatican fountains will be turned off gradually over the coming days.
