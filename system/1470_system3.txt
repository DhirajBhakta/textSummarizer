Taking stock of the air pollution in Delhi and the neighbouring states, the Supreme Court-appointed Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (EPCA) on Friday asked officials to immediately enforce the graded response action under very poor category for Delhi and moderate poor for NCR.Air quality for Delhi is very poor. 
Measures falling under this category of Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) have to be taken, EPCA member and head of Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), Sunita Narain said.The EPCA, however, in its first meeting on GRAP refrained from strict enforcements, like banning the diesel generators and hiking the parking fee  the measures that fall under the very poor category. 
Observing that the air quality in Delhi and NCR is already beyond poor, the EPCA has decided to enforce moderate poor category in the neighbouring states of Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Rajasthan, unless the task force formed by the Central Pollution Control Board starts providing the forecast for air pollution.The EPCA has been given the responsibility to implement the different categories of the GRAP. 
For moderate poor, the PM 2.5 range between 61 and 90 or PM 10 between 101 and 250 units, and for poor category, PM 2.5 should range between 91 and 120 and PM 10 between 251-350.Read |Delhi air quality very poor, calls for measures like ban on diesel gensetsMeasures under very poor include banning the use of diesel generator sets, enhancing parking fee by 3-4 times, increasing bus and metro services by augmenting contract buses and increasing frequency of services, stopping use of coal or firewood in hotels and open eateries and others, including warning people from going out.
