From Aditi Khanna London, Mar 5 (PTI) Tata Steel may be considering breaking off talks over a planned merger of its European business with German conglomerate Thyssenkrupp, a UK media report claimed today. 
The merger talks had been revealed by the Indian steel giant last year as part of a major restructuring of its UK steel business. 
Such a deal with the German steel major could potentially lead to the formation of a European steel behemoth with blast furnaces in Wales, the Netherlands and Germany. 
However, The Sunday Times claims that the deal may be under threat due to German pension liabilities.
