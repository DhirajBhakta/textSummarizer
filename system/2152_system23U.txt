Pope Francis has lambasted media organisations that focus on scandals and smears and promote fake news as a means of discrediting people in public life. 
Spreading disinformation was probably the greatest damage that the media can do, the pontiff told the Belgian Catholic weekly Tertio. 
It is a sin to defame people, he added.Using striking terminology, Francis said journalists and the media must avoid falling into coprophilia  an abnormal interest in excrement.
