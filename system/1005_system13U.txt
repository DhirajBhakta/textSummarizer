 The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) is likely to step up its campaign against Chinese goods in the run up to the Hindu campaign against the Hindu festival Rakshabandhan on August 7 by encouraging traders to not sell Chinese-made Rakhis.Volunteers of the Muslim Rashtriya Manch (MRM), the RSS Muslim wing, burnt Chinese goods in Lucknow. 
This, Sangh leaders say, has prompted them to think of ways to weaken the Chinese financially.This time we are going to encourage both traders and buyers not to sell Chinese Rakhiwe want to make the people aware of the sinister designs of the dragon and how by cooperating with us they can help deflate the Chinese ambitions, said RSS pracharak Mahirajdhwaj Singh, who is associated with the MRM.
