New Zealand has been sent in a tailspin after a surprise performance by Lorde at an Auckland public library was found to have been by a convincing impersonator.The pop star was widely reported by attendees of the weekly No Lights No Lycra dance party to have made a guest appearance to perform her new single, Green Light, on Monday night.A super ultra special guest had been teased in the lead-up to the event, billed as a weekly hour of dance freedom in total darkness at the Grey Lynn library for a door charge of NZ$7.Total darkness apparently worked in the impersonators favour, with many of those in attendance excitedly posting on social media about Lordes surprise appearance.You know you are in Auckland City when Lorde casually rocks out as the surprise guest at your local No Lights No Lycra hosted at the community library, posted one attendee on Facebook.
