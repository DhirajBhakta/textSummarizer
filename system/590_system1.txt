 Health services were crippled at the district hospital in Sector 30 for four hours on Monday as contractual doctors and paramedical staff went on a strike and protested against the hospital administration for not paying them salaries for the last three months. 
Nearly 150 doctors and nurses of the hospital took part in the four-hour protest from 8am to 12pm at the district hospital premises. 
Holding placards, the protesting staff demanded the immediate release of their pending salaries. 
The wages of the contractual staff are provided by the Noida authority, which are later disbursed by the hospital administration. 
Due to the protest, patients and permanent staff at the hospital faced inconvenience.
