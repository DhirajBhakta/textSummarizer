Why do you want to look at the leaf falling and the wind blowing This is the second time that a home production starring you is not directed by your father.?  I'm so happy and surprised how three people (Hrithik, Rakesh Roshan and Sanjay Gupta), who are equally headstrong, were working in complete unison. 
Perhaps, I am looking for something that is a little rarer or I want to use my films to express my own self through my interpretations of my experiences.
