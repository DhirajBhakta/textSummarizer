Soundarya Rajinikanth and Ashwin Ramkumar have finally ended their 7-year marriage today. 
The legal proceedings are all over and a family court in Chennai granted the couple a divorce on Tuesday. 
Soundarya, who married a Chennai-based industrialist Ashwin Ramkumar in 2010, took the decision after a difference of opinion. 
I request all to respect my family's privacy.A graphic designer by profession, Soundarya has worked in Tamil films such as Baba, Sandakozhi and Sivaji among others.
