Republicans refused to budge even after the White House complained that the congressional review infringed on Trumps executive authority.Moscow responded to a White House announcement last week that Trump intended to sign the bill, ordering a reduction in the number of U.S. diplomats in Russia.Top members of Trumps administration voiced their unhappiness with the bill anew this week, echoing his sentiments that it poses more diplomatic hindrances than solutions.Neither the president nor I are very happy about that, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Tuesday of the sanctions bill, which he had urged lawmakers not to approve.We were clear that we didnt think that was going to be helpful to our efforts, but thats the decision they made, he said.Tillerson conceded that he is unable to show that the US has fulfilled Trumps objective of a new, more cooperative relationship between the former Cold War foes, noting only modest efforts in Syria as a sign the nations share some common goals.
