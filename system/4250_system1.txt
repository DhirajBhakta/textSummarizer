Senior advocate Soli Sorabjee, appearing for the RBI, told the court that the bank would not press its application to intervene in the matter if it can take a fresh look into the award granted in favour of Docomo. 
They said that on March 8, the court had asked RBI to make its stand clear by showing the rule, regulation or circular under which the banks permission is required before transfer of money overseas under the award.
