We were really surprised that the patient did not notice it because it would cause quite a lot of irritation while it was sitting there," Rupal Morjaria, a specialist trainee ophthalmologist who dealt with the case at Solihull Hospital near Birmingham, said.Initially, eye specialists discovered 17 lenses, before a further examination disclosed that another 10 lenses were stuck in the eye.The patient said she had been wearing monthly disposable contact lenses for 35 years but did not attend regular appointments.As a result of the findings, the woman, who said she was unaware that the lenses were missing, had her operation postponed as the risk of developing endophthalmitis, inflammation of the interior of the eye, was increased."
