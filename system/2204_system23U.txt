The French president, Emmanuel Macron, has denounced Frances collaboration in the Holocaust, criticising those who negate or minimise the countrys role in sending tens of thousands of Jews to their deaths.After he and the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, attended a Holocaust commemoration, Macron also appealed for renewed Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. 
Worried that Netanyahu is backing away from commitment to a two-state solution, Macron assailed Jewish settlement construction as a threat to international hopes for peace.Commemorating 75 years since a mass roundup of Jews during the darkest chapter of modern French history, Macron insisted it was indeed France that organised this.Not a single German was directly involved, he said, but French police collaborating with the Nazis.Holocaust survivors recounted wrenching stories at the ceremony at the site of Vel dHiv stadium near the Eiffel Tower in Paris, where police herded 13,000 people on 16-17 July 1942 before they were deported to camps.
