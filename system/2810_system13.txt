According to a survey conducted by the Institute of Road Traffic Education (IRTE) of as many as 1,514 road signages over a stretch of 85 kilometres in the national capital, a total of 1,098 (nearly 75 per cent) have failed to meet the required parameters. 
??"Nearly 75 per cent of the road signages were found to be non-standard and wrongfully installed according to the regulations of the Indian Road Congress (IRC) and the United Nations," said Dr Rohit Baluja, president of IRTE, adding that many accidents occurred due to such negligence on the part of government agencies.
