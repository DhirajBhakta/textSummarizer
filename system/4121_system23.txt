From Lalit K Jha Washington, Mar 23 (PTI) If India lowers the 100 per cent tariffs imposed on the popular American Harley Davidson motorcycles it could result in more foreign investments in the country, a top White House trade official has argued. 
"If India agrees to lower its tariffs on Harley Davidson motorcycles, Indian consumers will buy more Harleys and save less while Harley will sell more Harleys and invest more," Peter Navarro, Director of White House National Trade Council, said in a letter to the editor to The Wall Street Journal.
