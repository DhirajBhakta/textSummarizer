On being asked why she chose Katrina to replace Britney in the dialogue, Pee Cee said "I couldn't think of anyone else. 
I think Katrina Kaif is a major icon for Hindi cinema and I really really like her."
She added, "This was my idea and I thought that it would be a fun replacment, and Katrina was really cool about it. 
I texted her before the trailer came out and she was like 'yeah, of course.'
