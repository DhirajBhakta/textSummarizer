Dhaka, Jan 10 (PTI) Taking exception to doctors sloppy handwriting, a top Bangladeshi court has ordered them to write easy-to-read prescriptions in block letters or type them to prevent wrong medicines being issued to patients. 
A bench comprising Justice Naima Haider and Justice Abu Taher Md Saifur Rahman issued the order after holding a primary hearing over a writ petition. 
HRPB counsel Manzill Murshid said: "Sometimes even employees at drug stores fail to read prescriptions and give wrong medicines to the patients."
