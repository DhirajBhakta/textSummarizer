The school is erringly quiet  there are no children on the small playground or, for that matter, in the classrooms.The Government Upper Primary Sanskrit School in Pratappura village has six classrooms, four teachers  but not a single student. 
It was once a thriving school with more than 50 students, but things changed a few years ago, Sanwarmal, the schools head teacher, told HT.The school, which was established in 1998 attracted children from the neighbouring villages.
