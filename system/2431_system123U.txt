During her recent interview with HTBrunch, Pooja Bhatt revealed that after making sensitive movies like Zakhm and Tamanna, she ventured into adult content with Jism because those kind of movies have a mass appeal.My first production was Tamanna. 
The age that Alia is today, I had made a film on female infanticide. 
Then I made Zakhm, again a sensitive movie based on my fathers real life story, was a box office disaster.
