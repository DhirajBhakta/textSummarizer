The  Brihanmumbai Sarvajanik Ganeshotsav Samanvay Samiti (BSGSS), the umbrella body of Ganesh mandals, has asked mandals to speak to MPs and MLAs in their constituencies to push the Centre to abolish silence zones, as an amendment to the noise rules. 
The WHO has said long-term exposure to noise levels between 85db and 90db leads to hearing loss.Anti-noise campaigners were shocked with the states decision and the mandals demand.
