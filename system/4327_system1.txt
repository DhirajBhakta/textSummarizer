Robert Vadra, son-in-law of Congress president Sonia Gandhi, has slammed Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal for consistently targeting him. 
Vadra, in a Facebook post, asked Kejriwal to speak to him directly instead of making baseless charges."
If the PM raises a finger against Robert Vadra, I'll be convinced he has a 56-inch chest...Vadra will eat him alive...He (Modi) is taking revenge on the people of Delhi for choosing us, and has been blocking our work, but we have done so much despite the hindrance," Kejriwal had said while delivering his vote of thanks speech to the Lieutenant Governor's address in the Assembly.
