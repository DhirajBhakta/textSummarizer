A drunk relative of a Samajwadi Party leader went berserk inside a police station in Uttar Pradesh's Etah, the stronghold of the former party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav and his clan. 
Samajwadi Party MLC Ramesh Yadav's nephew Mohit was caught on camera bragging about his association with the former ruling party before launching an unprovoked attack on a cop standing near him."
My name is Mohit Yadav...and this man," the man is seen shouting in the video before slapping a policeman. 
As others rush to control him, Mohit grabs the collar of one of the cops. 
Mohit Yadav has been arrested and charged with assault on policeman on duty.The Samajwadi Party was routed by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Assembly elections held in February-March but it seems people associated with the former ruling party are yet to come to terms to the humiliating loss.
