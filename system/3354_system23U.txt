Motor mouth Kolkata cleric Mualana Noor-ur Rehman Barkati continues to remain defiant despite three separate police complaints against him for defying the law and making derogatory comments. 
On Friday, the Imam of Kolkata's Tipu Sultan mosque reiterated that he will continue with a red beacon on his vehicle despite the central government ban on its use. 
When India Today questioned him on the illegal use of the beacon, an angry Barkati retorted asking, "Why are you so concerned about my red beacon""No one has the guts to remove my red beacon.
