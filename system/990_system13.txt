I will uphold the dignity of the office of the vice president, he told reporters.Indias beauty and strength lie in its parliamentary democratic system, Naidu said, adding that it will be his endeavour to strengthen this further.The former Union minister recalled his humble beginnings and likened the BJP to his mother.Having lost my mother at a very young age, I grew up with party workers and reached where I have due to the partys support, Naidu said.I am above any party now, he added.Sources close to him said Naidu resigned from the cabinet on Monday night after his candidature was announced.He said he will continue as a member of the Rajya Sabha and cast his vote in the vice presidential poll next month.Naidus win is all but certain due to the NDAs numerical superiority over opposition parties, which have fielded Gopalkrishna Gandhi as their nominee.Members of allies like TDP, Shiv Sena and LJP besides those of AIADMK and TRS, two parties outside the NDA fold but supporting Naidus candidature, were among the leaders who accompanied Naidu as he filed his nomination.Top leaders, including Modi, union ministers and allies like Ram Vilas Paswan, were among the proposers and seconders of his nomination.
