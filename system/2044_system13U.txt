China has strongly hit out at India after President Pranab Mukherjee hosted the Dalai Lama and other Nobel laureates at Rashtrapati Bhavan last week.The Foreign Ministry said Beijing was "strongly opposed" to the meet which would have a "negative impact" on relations.Indian Prime Ministers or Presidents rarely meet with the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader.The Narendra Modi government has taken a different approach to the Tibetan? issue, analysts say, showing less caution for China's sensitivities by approving visits by prominent Tibetan leaders to Arunachal Pradesh.
