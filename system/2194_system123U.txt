N R Narayana Murthy today said he regrets quitting as chairman of Infosys in 2014 and should have listened to other co-founders of India's second largest software exporter firm and stayed on. 
Murthy, who had infamous run-ins with the current management led by Vishal Sikka over corporate governance issues, however, said he did not miss being in the campus daily. 
Opening up about his biggest regrets - personal or profession, he recounted that "a lot of my founder colleagues told me not to leave Infosys in 2014, to stay a few years".
