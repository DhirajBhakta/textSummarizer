The National Zoological Park in New Delhi is exploring options to launch an animal adoption scheme for its inmates. 
Several zoos across India have already launched the scheme where a citizen or a corporate firm can adopt an animal.?
We are exploring various options to start an animal adoption scheme at the Delhi Zoo. 
The money is usually spent by the zoo to buy food, medicines and to meet other expenses of the animal. 
Also, the adopter can celebrate birthdays of the animals in the zoo and in some cases he also gets exemption from Income-Tax under section 80 (G) of the Income-Tax Act. 
Although the scheme is for all animals in the zoo, sources said that usually the scheme is for large animals like tigers, lions and elephants, which require maximum expenditure. 
While the Delhi Zoo is the only zoo in the country which is directly run by the Union ministry, others are managed by the respective state governments. 
Several zoos in India such as the Lucknow Zoo, Patna Zoo, Alipore Zoo in Kolkata, Mysore Zoo and Nandankanan in Odisha have already launched such initiatives. ?
