Actor Taapsee Pannu has made her name in Bollywood with hard-hitting roles in Pink (2016) and Naam Shabana, but it was quite different in her debut film, Jhummandi Naadam (2010), directed by K. 
If people are just going to sit there and wait [for a chance] to get hurt, so they can start throwing shit around at other people, you can never stop them.?
Taapsee, who is doing a Telugu film (titled Anando Brahma) after several years, adds that as soon as the negative reactions surfaced, she made it a point to clear the air with K. 
m waiting for the point [when] everyone will hear what I have to say, rather than me saying the same thing ten times to ten different people,? 
m just sitting back and seeing how people can have so much of hatred in them that they really want to make so much of negativity out of nothing.?
