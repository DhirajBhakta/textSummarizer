Tej Bahadur Yadav, the BSF jawan who was dismissed from duty for uploading a video on the 'substandard food' served to soldiers, today attended a Mumbai event honouring martyrs. 
Mumbai Congress Chief Sanjay Nirupam had called on Yadav to preside over the function as a guest. 
The sit-in protest will serve as an ultimatum to government to act on the deeply seated corruption in the armed forces.
