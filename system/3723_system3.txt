An advisory has been issued following complaints from parents and stakeholders that schools are indulging in commercial activities by way of selling books and uniforms within the school premises or through selected vendors. 
"CBSE norms mandate that schools are run as community service and not as a business and that commercialisation does not take place in the school in any shape whatsoever. 
Educational institutions are not commercial establishments and their sole purpose is to provide quality education," it added. 
The CBSE has also reiterated its directive to schools to stick to books published by the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT). 
"The Board receives reports and complaints regarding the pressure exercised by schools on children and their parents to buy textbooks other than (that of) NCERT," it said.
