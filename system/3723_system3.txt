The Central Board of Secondary Education has told schools affiliated to it that educational institutions are not commercial establishments and sale of books, uniforms and stationery by them is a violation of norms. 
An advisory has been issued following complaints from parents and stakeholders that schools are indulging in commercial activities by way of selling books and uniforms within the school premises or through selected vendors. 
The CBSE has also reiterated its directive to schools to stick to books published by the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT).
