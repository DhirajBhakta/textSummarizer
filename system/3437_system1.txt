In a decade to 2016, the incidents of molestation (under Section 354) reported in Bengaluru increased more than four-fold, statistics compiled by the city's Commissioner of Police show. 
Yet, according to our analysis of police data, of the 4,241 complaints filed between 2006 and 2016, the conviction rate was 0.37 per cent (16 cases).The number of complaints under under Section 354 (assault to outrage the modesty of a woman) rose from 150 in 2006 to 776 in 2016. 
Experts say this could be because of an increase in the number of incidents as well as greater willingness on the part of women to register complaints.This data project could serve as a template for how police in India's burgeoning cities can make sense of their crime data in public interest.Section 354 includes sexual harassment (354A), use of criminal force with intent to disrobe (354B), voyeurism (354C) and stalking (354D).
