In a sudden move, the Ministry of Home Affairs has awarded the 'Z' category security cover to Amar Singh. 
The MHA late Saturday night ordered Central Industrial Task Force commandos to immediately take charge of Singh's security. 
The ministry's order did not mention a reason for granting the security cover, which, importantly, will only be available to Singh in Uttar Pradesh and not the rest of India.
