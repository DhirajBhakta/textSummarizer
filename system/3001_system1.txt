6500 crore Navy chopper deal.
The Defence Ministry has scrapped a Rs 6,500 crore deal for buying 16 multirole helicopters for the Navy from America as the government is bargaining hard on price with foreign vendors and promoting Make in India in the military sector for reducing imports.The decision has come a couple of weeks before Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to the US where he would be meeting American President Donald Trump.With budgets not increasing in proportion with modernization demands of the armed forces, the Defence Ministry is using hard bargaining as a tool to cut down the cost of projects."
