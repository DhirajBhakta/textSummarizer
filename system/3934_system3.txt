She said the bank has undertaken an asset quality review (AQR) on its own, apart from the one mandated by the Reserve Bank in December 2015, in respect of all the common accounts as part of the merger process. 
"So, within May 27, the entire granular level data merger will be completed," she said further, adding that in the case of Bharatiya Mahila Bank and the treasury, the granular data merger has already been completed.
