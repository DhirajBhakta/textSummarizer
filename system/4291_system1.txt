Infosys, the Bangalore-based software trailblazer, created history on March 11 by becoming the first Indian-registered company to list on Nasdaq, one of the two major stock exchanges in the US.Technically, however, Infosys is the second Indian company to list on Nasdaq, since the $30 million (Rs 126 crore) US-registered but wholly Chennai-domiciled Cognizant Technology Solutions listed in June 1998. 
Although the most widely-tracked indicator of stock market health, the Dow, is based on its rival New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), close to 60 per cent of the total share volume and listed companies in the US is on Nasdaq. 
Already around 20 IT companies founded by Indian-Americans with a total market capitalisation of around $16 billion - like i2 Technologies, Microchip Technologies and Mastech - are listed on it.It is to Infosys' credit that it has been diligently following American accounting principles for the past few years so as to make its debut on Nasdaq easy.
