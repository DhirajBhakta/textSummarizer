The CJI was both upset and angry about the number of frivolous petitions piling up in the apex court, which is already reeling under a backlog of nearly 61,000 cases.Pointing out that he has started imposing heavy costs on such petitioners, he slapped fines of Rs 10 lakh on a Bihar MLA and Rs 1 lakh on a Maharashtra professor in two separate cases.The CJI's remarks came just before the lawyer for the professor said she wanted to withdraw the case, which was filed challenging a circular issued by the Gujarat government.
