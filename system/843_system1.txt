Any building or land situated within the jurisdiction of the MCG is liable to property tax. 
To encourage and assist taxpayers, rebate schemes have been in place since February. 
However, many residents chose to decline the offer and not make their payments. 
Hence, as per Section 130 (manner of recovering tax or fee) of the Haryana Municipal Act 1994, tax defaulters were issued multiple notices on their property tax dues. 
Since, they failed to clear their dues despite these measures, the MCG will now consider selling their properties to recover its dues.? 
SS Rohilla, spokesperson of MCG, said.The 20 properties are located at DLF Phase 4, sectors 43, 48, 57, 14, 16, Udyog Vihar Phase 5, Udyog Vihar Phase 4, Udyog Vihar Phase 1, Gadoli, Kherki Daula, Pace City 2 and Amar Colony.Incidentally, HT story last week had highlighted that MCG officials are pondering over auctioning 14 properties for recovering property tax dues.Read I Gurgaon: MCG extends deadline for property tax payment till April 30MCG officials were due to start the auctioning process from May 20, but seeing high recovery due to rebate schemes, it deferred the process indefinitely and introduced more such schemes till July 15.
