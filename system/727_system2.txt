A Chinese spy ship has been spotted off the coast of Queensland during a joint training exercise between Australian and US forces, the defence department has confirmed.The Type 815 Auxiliary General Intelligence (AGI) vessel was sighted during war games, known as Exercise Talisman Sabre, and defence officials told the ABCs AM program it was a provocative move. 
Australia respects the rights of all states to exercise freedom of navigation in international waters in accordance with international law, the department said.But Euan Graham, from the Lowy Institute, said the presence of the Chinese ship sent an unfriendly message.
