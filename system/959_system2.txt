In an initiative to clean up their surroundings and keep city walls free from defacement, residents of Greater Noida are taking the responsibility of particular localities and walls in commercial and residential areas.The initiative was started by Active Citizens Team, a voluntary residents? 
The team had started a campaign to remove posters in Greater Noida about a fortnight ago.?
The volunteers removed posters and banners that were defacing the walls. 
So we had decided that residents would take the responsibility for their respective localities and keep them tidy with the help of volunteers,? 
We had made several appeals to the Greater Noida authority, which is responsible for taking down illegal posters and banners in the city, but there has been no definitive action taken by the authority against defacers.
