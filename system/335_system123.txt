The Maharashtra government plans to launch a mobile app where farmers can fill their loan waiver forms.Around 89 lakh farmers, who will benefit from the farm loan waiver of Rs34,022 crore announced last month, are expected to fill their personal and loan-related details in the forms. 
The app will have a two-page form in which the farmers will have to put their personal details, including name, PAN and Aadhaar numbers, details of the loans they have taken and a declaration that the applicant is eligible for the loan waiver.
