Those who won't take part, would not stop it even if they take part (in the session).""
Congress needs to think whether it wants to take fringe position or mainstream position on issues of national interests," Jaitley said.MIDNIGHT SESSIONArun Jaitley rejected the Opposition's claim that the midnight session of Parliament for GST launch was a 'self-promotion' move by the Modi government."
