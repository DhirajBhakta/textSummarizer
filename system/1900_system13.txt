Two weeks after a 15-year-old girl accused a 35-year-old builder and his four friends of allegedly raping and blackmailing her over a period of four months in south Delhis Jamia Nagar, the police on Saturday arrested the builder from Bijnor in Uttar Pradesh. 
RP Upadhyay, joint commissioner of police (southeastern range), said that Sajid was the main accused in the gang rape case and was absconding since the FIR was registered. 
Six raids were made over the past two weeks to nab them, said Upadhyay.On Friday, DCP (southeast) Romil Baaniya said, the investigating team received inputs about Sajids movements in Bijnor.
