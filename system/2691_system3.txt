If Shah Rukh Khan agreed to do a cameo in Salman Khan-starrer Tubelight, the Bajrangi Bhaijaan actor has decided to return the favour by shaking a leg in one of the dance numbers for Aanand L Rai's next with SRK. 
While the two Khans have already begun shooting for the film, here's some scoop. 
The car is newly launched and no one owns this mean machine currently. 
Salman was shocked as he wasn't expecting this at all. 
But because he had managed his dates and agreed to shoot for the song on such a short notice, SRK wanted to gift him something to show his love and appreciation."
After Tubelight, we cannot wait to see SRK and Salman share screen space again in Aanand L Rai's next.
