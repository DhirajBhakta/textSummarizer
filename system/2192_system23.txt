The president had secret service protection at that point, and that raised a question with me.A spokesman for the secret service later confirmed that Trump Jr was not under the agencys protection at the time of the meeting and thus we would not have screened anyone he was meeting with.Under pressure from the New York Times, Trump Jr this week released damning emails revealing he eagerly embraced what he was told was a Russian government attempt to damage the Clinton campaign.The emails show music promoter Rob Goldstone telling the future presidents son that the crown prosecutor of Russia had offered to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father.The New York Times reported that Trump signed off on his sons first statement to the Times about the meeting, which like subsequent statements was soon revealed not to be a full account of events.Kushner, Trumps senior adviser, and then campaign manager Paul Manafort also attended the meeting.
