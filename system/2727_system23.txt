The usage of Hindi in Namma Metro stations is turning into a major controversy with many Pro-Kannada organiastions at loggerheads with Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL). 
WHO DID THISBoth BMRCL officials as well as Pro-Kannada organisations claim innocence over this act.ENGLISH OK, HINDI NOT OKPraveen Shetty, Karnataka Rakshana Vedike (KRV) state president said that Kannada is the language of the state and not Hindi. 
So, it is alright for Kannada and English to co-exist but not Hindi.
