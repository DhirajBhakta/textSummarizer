By Aditi Khanna London, Jul 18 (PTI) Britains first woman Sikh MP has been elected to an influential cross-party panel in the UK Parliament that examines the workings of the Home Office. 
The House of Commons Home Affairs Select Committee was chaired by Keith Vaz, Britains longest-serving Indian-origin MP, until he stepped down from the post last year. 
At the end of an inquiry, the committee often produces a report setting out its findings and making recommendations to the UK government.
