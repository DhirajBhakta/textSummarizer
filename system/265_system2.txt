Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has reserved around Rs. 1 billion (100 crore in Pakistani rupees) to bear the legal costs of filing compensation claim against the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) in the ICC Disputes Resolution Committee.PCB Chairman Shaharyar Khan said in an interview on Saturday that the board of governors meeting on Friday had given approval for the budget to cover the legal costs.We have hired a British law firm to represent us in the case and file the compensation claim with the disputes resolution committee, Khan said.He said the PCB had no option but to seek compensation from the BCCI for not playing any bilateral series with Pakistan despite a MOU signed between the two boards in 2014.Khan said the claim would be filed with the ICC committee shortly after the BCCI had failed to respond to the notice of intent sent to them by the PCB and three rounds of talks with their officials also failed to break the deadlock.READ | Sports minister Vijay Goel slams BCCI for meeting PCB officials in DubaiThe BCCI claims they cant play any bilateral series with us since their government is not giving clearance to them, he added.Under the MOU the two countries are supposed to play six bilateral series between 2015 and 2022.The PCB, he said, had already sent a notice to the BCCI seeking USD 69 million in compensation from the Indians.With India refusing to play us in a bilateral series we have lost millions in revenues.
