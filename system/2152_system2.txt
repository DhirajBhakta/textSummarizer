Spreading disinformation was probably the greatest damage that the media can do, the pontiff told the Belgian Catholic weekly Tertio. 
It is a sin to defame people, he added.Using striking terminology, Francis said journalists and the media must avoid falling into coprophilia  an abnormal interest in excrement. 
I think the media have to be very clear, very transparent, and not fall into  no offence intended  the sickness of coprophilia, that is, always wanting to cover scandals, covering nasty things, even if they are true, he said. 
And since people have a tendency towards the sickness of coprophagia, a lot of damage can be done.He also spoke of the danger of using the media to slander political rivals. 
It is a sin and it is hurtful.Disinformation was the greatest potential harm the media could cause, he said, because it directs opinion in only one direction and omits the other part of the truth.
