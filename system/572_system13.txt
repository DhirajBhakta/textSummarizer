We need to end unnecessary expense to give us a bigger therapeutic bang for the NHS buck, so we cut the fat and build the therapeutic muscle, he said.A spokeswoman for the BMA said the organisation believes there should be no further NHS funding for homeopathy adding that limited and scarce NHS resources should only be used to support medicines and treatment that have been shown to be effective.But Cristal Sumner, chief executive of the British Homeopathic Association said the NHS plans were bad for its already overstretched budget and for patients and criticised the report used to draw up the new guidelines.This recommendation is not cost effective as patients will be prescribed more expensive conventional drugs in place of homeopathy, which defeats the object of the exercise, she said.Meanwhile, NHS England has been accused of introducing ability to pay through the back door by forcing patients to pay for other products it claims are ineffective, over-priced and low value, instead of giving prescriptions for them.
