After Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) sent around 4,000 notices to housing societies, hotels, hospitals and other institutions in Andheri (East) for failing to segregate waste, it is holding a three-day exhibition to raise awareness among residents and school students about waste management. 
The ward office of the area is hosting more than 40 waste management companies from across the country to interact with residents. 
According to civic officials, the companies participating in the workshop are based in Bangalore, Nashik, Pune, Thane and Navi Mumbai. 
Jain also said the residents can place orders for equipments they want to buy at the workshop.
