Mohabbatein girl Kim Sharma disappeared from the spotlight when she married business tycoon Ali Punjani in 2010 and moved to Kenya. 
The irony is that when Ali met Kim, he was plump and not great-looking but now because he is in love, he has lost weight and looking great. 
She is now a brand strategist and goes by the name Kimi Sharma (her real name).
