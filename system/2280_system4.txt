The chief minister was speaking to reporters emerging from a meeting with Union home minister Rajnath Singh with whom she discussed the security situation in the state. 
Militants have stepped up attacks in recent months on government forces in the state as counter-insurgency operations intensify. 
Their meeting also came a day after the home minister briefed top opposition leaders on the situation in the valley and steps taken to ensure better security for the Amarnath pilgrims. 
The home ministry in consultation with the state government has decided to erect 21 more security pickets on the Amarnath route to check whether any vehicle carrying pilgrims is moving beyond the deadline of 7pm in the Valley.
