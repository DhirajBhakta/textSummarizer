In a major goof up, the Uttar Pradesh Congress today released a booklet in Lucknow in which Kashmir has been labeled as Indian-occupied Kashmir. 
The booklet, which targets the BJP-led NDA government as it completes three years and highlights its failures, was released by Ghulam Nabi Azad? and Raj Babbar.The 11th page of the 16-page booklet talks of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and carries a map of the project. 
Text appearing alongside the map says that the $54 billion CPEC will pass through Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir to connects Gwadar Port in the Arabian sea to China. 
The Congress also targeted the BJP saying that the ruling party has been lax in securing India's borders and that the defence preparedness of India has been compromised under the Narendra Modi government.
