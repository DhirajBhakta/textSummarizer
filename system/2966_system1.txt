Mumbai, Jun 17 (PTI) Mika Singh says singers should be given priority over film stars when it comes to doing playback in films. 
Of late a lot of female and male actors have done playback for songs in their films and also managed to strike a chord with the audiences. 
"I believe if an actor is the right fit for a particular song then by all means he or she should be given the song. 
However, singers should be given priority," Mika told PTI.
