Harshvardhan Kapoor, who made his big Bollywood debut with Mirzya, went onto win a handful of Best Debut trophies at various award functions. 
He expressed his displeasure over not winning the award and said, "Although I picked up two debutant awards earlier, I was really looking forward to winning the black lady. 
It shouldn't go to an actor who has worked in several films in another industry or language."
