The whir of the ATM machine sounded very reassuring for Jitesh Diwakar, a resident of Tonk in Rajasthan. 
But he was not prepared for what followed ? 
an avalanche of cash for Diwakar who got Rs 70,000 in place of just Rs 3,500 he had typed in.Diwakar was among several people who turned richer after a malfunctioning ATM rained cash on Tuesday evening at the Rajasthan town, about 80 km from capital Jaipur.But he was the only person who chose to inform the Bank of Baroda about the malfunctioning cash-dispensing machine ? 
We have taken a back-up of the ATM machine (records) from which we will get information of the people who withdrew money in these two hours.
