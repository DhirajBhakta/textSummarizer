If the rumours and leaks are to be believed, then the phone may launch on June 15 itself. 
The smartphone will succeed One Plus 3T, which was arguably one of the best phones to launch last year. 
Rumours suggest that the smartphone could come in two storage variants- with 6G RAM and 64GB ROM and the second one with 8GB of RAM with 128GB internal storage.
