A new public swimming area on Pariss Canal de lOurcq has reopened after it was temporarily closed due to higher than normal bacteria levels following weekend rains.The floating structure that has been put in place for the summer has allowed Parisians to legally swim in the canal at La Villette for the first time in decades. 
It proved very popular when it opened this month and was hailed by the Paris mayor, Anne Hidalgo, as the beginning of a dream to launch open swimming areas in other city waterways, including on the river Seine in 2024 if Paris succeeds in its bid to host the Olympics that year.The swimming area was briefly closed on Monday after a routine test on Sunday night found higher than normal levels of enterococci, bacteria found in faecal matter.
