Modern diesel cars produce 10 times more toxic air pollution than heavy trucks and buses, new European data has revealed.The stark difference in emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) is due to the much stricter testing applied to large vehicles in the EU, according to the researchers behind a new report. 
Following the Volkswagen dieselgate scandal, the car tests are due to be toughened, but campaigners say the reforms do not go far enough.The new report from the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT), a research group that played a key role in exposing Volkswagens cheating, compared the emissions from trucks and buses in realistic driving conditions with those of cars.It found that heavy-duty vehicles tested in Germany and Finland emitted about 210mg NOx per kilometre driven, less than half the 500mg/km pumped out by modern diesel cars that meet the highest Euro 6 standard.
