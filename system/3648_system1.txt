Padma Shri award-winning singer-composer Kailash Kher says getting Bollywood actress Sonakshi Sinha on board to perform at Justin Bieber's maiden concert in India over any other acclaimed Indian singer is not a good sign, and sends a wrong message internationally.The singer added that getting a known Bollywood face has become a trend followed by event managers and producers of the Indian entertainment industry."
And then she will get concert offers from Canada, and then probably Sonakshi will laugh them off saying 'I am not a singer but an actor'," Kailash said, over phone from Mumbai about Sonakshi, who made her debut as a singer in 2015 with single Ishqholic, and also judged singing reality show, Indian Idol Junior.He added, "Whenever any singer from the West comes to India, we get an actor on board to match their level.
