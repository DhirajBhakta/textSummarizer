38th over: England 120-5 (Stokes 17, Ali 25) A rare quiet over for South Africa, Maharaj struggling manfully to stem the flow of runs ... then, after just a single ceded from the over, Moeen drives its final ball, Morkel keels over but can?
34th over: England 93-5 (Stokes 15, Ali 0) Stokes eases a drive past the dive of mid-off for four, so Maharaj tries a flatter, quicker one - he looks a fine, intelligent bowler I must say. 
A couple of years ago, I wondered if England should bring Eoin Morgan back into the Test side...Eoin Morgan needs another go in the Test team. 
23rd over: England 68-3 (Cook 42, Bairstow 6) Root is now inside the dressing room and looking glum; on the bright side, perhaps Cook is playing his way into Test form, and as non-captain.
