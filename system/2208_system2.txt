And some wise heads are already gathering for the meeting...Jeremy Smith: The reality is that Englands best number three is still Jonathan Trott, a 36-year-old who retired from international cricket two years ago on health grounds.Zia Faruqui: Are Buttler or Morgan really the solution Surely both play in the same single devil-may-care mode as the current incumbents Need Hameed back.Neil Virani: Im quite amazed by people calling for Test players based on ODI performances. 
38th over: England 120-5 (Stokes 17, Ali 25) A rare quiet over for South Africa, Maharaj struggling manfully to stem the flow of runs ... then, after just a single ceded from the over, Moeen drives its final ball, Morkel keels over but cant stop it properly, and after some tricklage, England add four more. 
Is the reality not that its Moeen, not Dawson, whos been picked over Rashid My thinking behind that being that the balance of the team was meant to be a control spinner plus a wicket taking spinner, and that neither Moeen nor Rashid could fulfill the former role Im clearly not suggesting thats worked, by the way, but potentially that was the theory.Id say that in the end, the captain gets what he wants, because hes the one taking the players onto the pitch and its pointless giving him a bowler hed rather not bring on.
