Pakistan Peoples Party chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari has warned the Trump administration against including his country in the list of travel ban nations, saying such a move will create a "host of hostilities" between the two countries.Bilawal's remarks came as the White House is seeking to expand the list of seven Muslim-majority countries whose citizens have been barred from entering the US."
As far as the ban is concerned, I believe it only has detrimental effects on the countries it has included and if that is extended to Pakistan it will create a whole host of hostilities," Bilawal told a Washington audience.He was responding to a question on whether Pakistan can be included in a list of seven nations as per an executive order signed by US President Donald Trump last week.Bilawal said including Pakistan in such a list "would also be a very negative indicator that the United States is turning away from those very ideals that it stood for", adding that, "I hope that this is not the new normal."
