Dozens of teen pregnancy prevention programs deemed ineffective by President Donald Trumps administration will lose more than $200 million in funding following a surprise decision to end five-year grants after only three years.The administrations assessment is in sharp contrast with that of the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, which credited the program with contributing to an all-time low rate of teen pregnancies.Rachel Fey of the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy said Tuesday that grantees under the Teen Pregnancy Prevention Program were given no explanation when notified this month their awards will end next June.
