Authorities said bringing the museum to the heart of the city would attract more visitors and rake in some revenue. 
Rani Baug is visited by thousands of people all through the week and during the weekends. 
The authorities want to shift the museum to the building where the zoos latest attraction, the Humboldt penguins, are kept. 
BEST authorities said it has asked the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) for space on the second floor of this building. 
The Anik bus depot museum is far away, and people have often complained they dont visit as the travel is a pain. 
This is why we have asked for space at Rani Baug. said Anil Kokil, BEST committee chairman.
