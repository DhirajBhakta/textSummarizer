Bhopal, Feb 12 (PTI) RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat has said that no one has the right to judge others patriotism. 
"Even if you thinks that you are running the show in the country, you cannot measure anybodys patriotism, or after evaluating it come out with a judgment on it that if this is the kind of bhakti (devotion) you have, then it is patriotism, otherwise it isnt," Bhagwat said.
