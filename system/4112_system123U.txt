Here is our Phillauri movie review.Phillauri Cast: Anushka Sharma, Diljit Dosanjh, Suraj Sharma, Mehreen PirzadaPhillauri Direction: Anshai LalPhillauri Rating:  (1.5/5) When the friendly spirit Shashi is asked why she is stuck with the soon-to-be-married Kanan, she says, "Pata nahi, main to yahi atki hui hoon." 
Anshai Lal's 138-minute long Phillauri could speak for itself here.Once the one-line idea of guy-getting-married-to-spirit has been established, the film hovers around, like Shashi, from one useless scene to another which are neither funny nor interesting nor of any service to whatever goodness the film has.So, Kaneda-return Punjabi boy Kanan, 26, returns to India to get married.
