Im hoping that this book helps people stop judging people who date [after the loss of a partner], particularly women, because women get judged more harshly, she said. 
And, you know, obviously thats super unfair.She added: I think Im helping people remember that dating, for those that want to do it, is part of moving forward, and its option B. 
I think we all go through that.But the process of dealing with the loss of her husband and best friend had given her life a deeper meaning, and more perspective on lifes difficulties, she said.
