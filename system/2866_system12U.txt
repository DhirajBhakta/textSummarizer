Washington, Jun 24 (PTI) Your brain power may be significantly reduced when your smartphone is within reach - even if it is switched off - affecting your ability to concentrate on a task, scientists have found. 
The tests were geared to measure participants available cognitive capacity - that is, the brains ability to hold and process data at any given time. 
The researchers found that participants with their phones in another room significantly outperformed those with their phones on the desk, and they also slightly outperformed those participants who had kept their phones in a pocket or bag.
