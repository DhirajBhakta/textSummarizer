Newcastle United owner and Sports Direct boss Mike Ashley has won a high court battle over a ?15m deal allegedly made in a London pub, calling time on a case that will be long remembered for days of evidence concerning excessive alcohol consumption.The case revolved around investment banker Jeffrey Blues allegation that during a night of heavy drinking at the Horse and Groom pub near Sports Directs Oxford Street store in January 2013, Ashley agreed to pay him ?15m if the companys shares doubled to ?8.However, on Wednesday, Mr Justice Leggatt, who had said he found the case was a lot more interesting than some, ruled that no one would have thought what Ashley said in the pub was serious.The Sports Direct senior management meetings certainly show that Mr Ashley is happy to combine discussion of business matters with the consumption of alcohol, the judge said in his ruling.
