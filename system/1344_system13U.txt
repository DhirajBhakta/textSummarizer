Bollywood actor Amitabh Bachchan has at least one Vodafone connection and it's giving him (some) trouble. 
The service is apparently so bad that Big B had to tweet about it. 
The last time he did something like this - on Twitter - Samsung had to replace his faulty Note 7, with a Galaxy S7 (of course). 
Interestingly, Reliance Jio was (also) quick to rise to the occasion, responding to big B's tweet saying it "would be happy to deliver a Jio SIM to him and activate it instantly through their Aadhaar based eKYC home delivery process."
