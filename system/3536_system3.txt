Mumbai, Apr 30 (PTI) Actor Irrfan Khan reveals filmmaker Tigmanshu Dhulia had offered him to play the titular role in "Revolver Rani," which later went to Kangana Ranaut. 
The 50-year-old actor says he had almost joined the project but did not take up the offer due to "intimate scenes" in the film. 
He had offered me Kangana Ranauts role when he was producing the film. 
I had made up my mind to do it. 
"I would love to play a woman on-screen. 
But I am not ok with intimate scenes as that might put them (audience) off," he adds. 
In his upcoming film, "Hindi Medium" Irrfans plays a businessman who owns a saree shop in Delhis Chandni Chowk.
