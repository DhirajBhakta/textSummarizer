London, Apr 24 (PTI) Oxford University students who avoid making eye contact with their peers could be guilty of racism, according to the prestigious varsitys latest guidance. 
It also claims that "jokes drawing attention to someones differences" and "not speaking directly to people" are potential forms of "everyday racism". 
Williams, who is author of Academic Freedom in an Age of Conformity, said that Oxford Universitys guidance was "overstepping the mark" by telling students "how they should feel and think".
