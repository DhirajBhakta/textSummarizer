The Delhi police on Friday told a city court that they could not de-seal the room at a five star hotel, where former Congress minister Shashi Throor wife Sunanda Pushkar was found dead. 
More than three years after the incident, police have not been able to reach a conclusion and said they will take more time to investigate.  
Replying to a court order, police said that despite two visits by Central Forensic Science Laboratory (CFSL) experts and five different reports from medical boards, they are yet to find out how she was murdered.
