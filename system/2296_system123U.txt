Thailands Buddhist monks could soon be issued smart ID cards flagging any drug or criminal records, in the latest move by the junta to restore the tarnished image of the men in orange robes.The kingdom has around 300,000 monks, who are held in high regard as keepers of the national religion. 
But in recent months the clergy has been plagued by a series of high-profile scandals ranging from sex and drugs to murders taking place at temples.The junta, which took power in 2014, wants to reorganise Thai Buddhism, with misbehaving monks first in their crosshairs.Monks across the country already hold the paper-based cards but the information is out-of-date, which makes it hard to verify their background, Ormsin Chivapruck, an official at the Office of the Prime Minister, told reporters on Thursday.Digitalised smart cards would enable up-to-date tracking with the monks monastic history recorded alongside any criminal offence or report of drug use, he added.
