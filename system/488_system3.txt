Reacting to these shameless trolls, actor Ram Kapoor, who has worked with Sunny in the film Kuch Kuch Locha Hai (2015), says its completely wrong for people to say things against her based on her past career choices.I find this absolutely ridiculous.

What if you were some banker or were an employee in an office, but you were a shitty parentRam feels that it is high time people stop trolling celebrities on their personal life and should respect their choices.
