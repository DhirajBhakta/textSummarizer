Referring to when Warren hesitated and showed Faye the card with the winners name, Michael says, "I actually think Warren Beatty is the unsung hero here, completely heroic. 
I think he was showing her (Dunaway) the card, like, hey are you seeing what Im seeing? 
"If I was in that job, and I know Im Monday morning quarterbacking, which I detest, but I feel like if its my one job, if I heard the wrong name, Id walk directly to Warren Beatty and say you got the wrong envelope, heres the right envelope, and make a charming moment out of it."
