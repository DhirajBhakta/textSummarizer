Baltimore Ravens offensive lineman John Urschel has abruptly retired from the NFL after just three seasons, the team announced on Thursday.The 26-year-old from Winnipeg, who is a doctoral candidate in applied mathematics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, was expected to compete for a starting role at center or guard in training camp, which gets under way this week in suburban Baltimore.Urschels surprise decision comes two days after the release of a medical study that further underscored the link between the degenerative brain disease chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) and participation in football. 
But I enjoy carving out my own path and not listening to what people say I can and I cant do.By retiring after three full seasons, Urschel is eligible for an NFL pension.Urschel is not the first player to attribute early retirement to fears over the connection between football and CTE.
