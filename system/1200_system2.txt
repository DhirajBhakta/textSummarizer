After the makers of the Akshay Kumar and Huma Qureshi-starrer were made to remove four scenes from the film before its release, comes the news that Jolly LLB 2 has been banned in Pakistan.According to a report in DNA, a reference to the Kashmir issue spelled doom for the film's Pakistan release. 
The report quotes a source as saying, "In the movie, Akshay Kumar plays a lawyer who treats his profession casually until he comes across the case of an innocent man who is killed and declared a Kashmiri militant, while the real Kashmiri militant goes into hiding in Uttar Pradesh. 
Bringing up the issue has not gone down well with the Pakistani censor board.
