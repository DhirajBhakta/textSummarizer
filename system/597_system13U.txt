In an embarrassment for the Maharashtra government, the family of the late wrestler Khashaba Dadasaheb Jadhav, who bagged Indias first individual Olympic bronze medal in 1952, on Monday threatened to auction it off to finance a wrestling academy the state had long promised to fund.The legendary wrestlers son, Ranjit K. 
Jadhav said that it was exactly 65 years ago (July 24), when his father created history for India sports by bagging the first individual Olympic medal in Bantamweight Freestyle wrestling at the Helsinki Olympics in 1952.Since then, it was my fathers dream to set up a full-fledged world-class wrestling academy in our village, Goleshwar (Karad sub-district) in Satara.
