The Tamil Nadu government on Wednesday raised the monthly salary of MLAs from Rs 55,000 to Rs 1.05 lakh, a move that has angered farmers in the southern state that is battling its worst agrarian crisis in 140 years.Tamil Nadu is in the grip of a severe drought that has worsened the economic condition of farmers, many of whom recently returned to protest in Delhi after the state government allegedly failed to fulfil its promises.Earlier this year, the government had declared all 32 districts drought-hit.The government does not want to give us remunerative prices but wants to increase their salaries, said P Ayyakannu, who is leading the protest in Delhi.Chief minister Edapaddi Palanisami, who in April sought time from farmers to address their problems, announced the hike in the salary and perks in the state assembly that will be effective from July 1.Palanisami had promised he would request Prime Minister Narendra Modi to waive off farm loans.
