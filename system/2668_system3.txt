Only Sachin Tendulkar (49) and Ricky Ponting (30) have more centuries than him the 50-over format.Tendulkar has 18,426 runs from 463 ODIs while the Indian captain has amassed 8257 runs so far from 189 matches.Kohli, who had a quiet series to his standards before this match, came out with intent and was positive right from the word go.Chasing 206 to win the fifth and final ODI, India lost Shikhar Dhawan in the first over for 4 with the score on 5. 
He steadied the ship with in-form Ajinkya Rahane and struck a 79-run partnership with the Mumbaikar, before the opener fell for 39 in the 19th over.Kohli continued his seamless batting and reached his fifty off 67 balls with a beautifully timed boundary of the bowling off Ashely Nurse in the 22nd over. 
The 28-year-old then made sure that the batting doesn't falter like before and held one end and allowed Dinesh Karthik to settle in before accelerating.
