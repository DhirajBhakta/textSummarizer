New Delhi, Mar 14 (PTI) ShopClues board today come out in support of co-founders Radhika Aggarwal and Sanjay Sethi, saying the e-commerce marketplace has made "fantastic progress" under them. 
It is very disappointing to see an ex-founder, who disassociated from the company for his (alleged) criminal wrongdoings, is now engaged in a personal vendetta on a public forum," said a statement issued on behalf of ShopClues board. 
On Sunday, Sandeep made several allegations against his estranged wife Radhika in a series of Facebook posts. 
Radhika, who is currently the chief business officer at ShopClues, said she is shocked by the unfounded and baseless allegations. 
"We remain focused on working closely with Radhika and Sanjay and the management team to continue to scale the company as it captures the massive opportunity which lies ahead of us," it added.
