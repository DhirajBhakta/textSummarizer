With the aim to engage and mobilise young women in the age group of 18-25 years, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Delhi has planned to set up Yuvti Prakoshth (Young Womens Cell) for the first time. 
The proposed unit will not be the part of either Mahila Morcha (Womens Wing) or Yuva Morcha (Youth Wing), and will work as an independent division.
