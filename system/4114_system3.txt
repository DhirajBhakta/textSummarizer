A woman hailing from Queensland, Australia, must have tried to get some rest after sending her five-year-old daughter to school, but when do mothers get to restShe received a concerned call from the school informing that her daughter had packed a Smirnoff raspberry vodka in her lunchbox. 
Earlier in the day, the mother had asked her little one to grab a pack of juice from the freezer but instead of juice, the 5-year-old grabbed vodka.? The mother realised the blunder but thankfully she did not get in trouble since the teachers assumed it was a genuine mistake of a five-year-old.Embarrassed and simultaneously realising the hilarity of the incident, the woman made a Facebook post about it, calling it an EPIC LUNCHBOX FAIL."
