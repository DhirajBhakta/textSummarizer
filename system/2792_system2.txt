When you think of a beauty pageant as reputed as Miss Universe, you probably don't think that those who don't fit into the stereotype of beauty will be allowed to enter it.

And while she has always proved how brave she is by not getting rid of the moles through surgery, her bold step of auditioning for Miss Universe Malaysia has actually sent a message of hope across the world. 
Battling body-image issues is difficult enough, but to do it through a platform like a beauty pageant is even more praise-worthy.
