In a big step towards realising Prime Minister Narendra Modi's dream for a cashless India, country's most profitable and third largest retail chain - defence canteens, are turning fully cashless from March 1 across the country. 
"The canteen stores department (CSD) and the unit run canteens under it have been asked by the services to turn cashless from March 1 as they will sell goods only using plastic money," sources told Mail Today here.
