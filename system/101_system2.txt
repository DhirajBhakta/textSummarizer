After a swarm of bees held up a Hyderabad-Pune flight last week for more than one hour, the country aviation regulator said it will investigate how a bee hive was allowed to flourish in the airport area. 
The flight on July 26 was held up when the ATR72 - a short-haul aircraft - was besieged by bees. 
Commenting on the incident, Captain Mohan Ranganathan, aviation safety expert, said, Bees do not pose a threat to the ATR but the engineers and other ground staff who play a major role before take-off would  have found it impossible to perform their functions due to their presence.
