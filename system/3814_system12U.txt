Co-starring Naseeruddin Shah, Chunky Pandey, Ila Arun, Gauahar Khan in key roles, Begum Jaan, the Hindi remake of the critically acclaimed Bengali film Rajkahini (2015) is all set to hit theatres on April 14. 
The Pakistan censor board reportedly asked the film's makers for two cuts, the scene where the Indian national anthem was played and portions showing the Indian national flag.
