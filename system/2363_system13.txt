In a strange way, and I said this to (Sapochnik) during Battle of the Bastards, I think that in a weird way this could be Jons natural home, on this battlefield, where he comes to life. 
For all of his good, hes a violent man, says Harington.The actor adds Jons character does not have much to do with happiness.I think happiness is a very strange term to associate with Jon.
