oppn (With additional inputs) New Delhi, May 2 (PTI) Union Minister and LJP president Ram Vilas Paswan today took a dig at the opposition parties over their attempts at unity, saying they should not waste their time as there is no vacancy for the prime ministers post till 2024. 
Keeping in view, the continued lack of government jobs, the party also demanded the early implementation of reservation in the private sector, Paswan said. 
The party also adopted a resolution to make one crore new members throughout the country during a membership drive from August 15 to January 26. 
Paswan raked up corruption allegations against Prasad and his two sons, both ministers in the Nitish Kumar government, and said the JD(U) chief is troubled over this.
