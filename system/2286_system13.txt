Maharashtra has become the first state to make social boycott a crime after President Pranab Mukherjee cleared the legislation. 
The Maharashtra Prohibition of People from Social Boycott (Prevention Prohibition and Redressal) Act prescribes a maximum punishment of three year in jail and a fine of Rs1lakh.
