Why Because, kanwar yatra. 
And kanwariyas prefer only pure vegetarian food.The police's justification for bringing this into practice this year is that the number of pilgrims returning from Haridwar to Greater Noida has increased this year.Ram Sen Singh, SHO, Dadri police station, told Times of India, "We have also removed vendors serving non-vegetarian food. 
They will be off the road till the religious season of kanwar yatra is on."
