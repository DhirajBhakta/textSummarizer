The inability of Indian Railways' to stop unauthorised crowd occupying reserved seats of a train has cost it a sum of Rs 30,000 as a compensation to a family which could not use washrooms for more than an hour an half as the passage to the toilet was blocked. 
Dev Kant, who is the deputy legal advisor in the ministry of law and justice took the Indian Railways to the consumer court saying they had encountered mental and physical stress due to deficiency in service while travelling from Amrtisar to Delhi in 2009 with his wife and two children. 
The counsel for the Northern Railways told court that the crowd was asked to vacate the train at the Ambala station and, therefore, had taken timely action.
