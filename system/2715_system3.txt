The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) today asked a TADA court in Mumbai that Abu Salem, a convict in the 1993 Mumbai serial blasts case, be sentenced to life in prison.The Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act (TADA) court found Abu Salem, Mustafa Dossa, Firoz Abdul Rashid Khan, Tahir Merchant, Karimullah Khan, and Riyaz Siddique guilty of all charges in the case on June 16.The CBI's prosecutor today noted that since Salem was extradited from Portugal under section 34C of the Extradition Act, he can't be given capital punishment.However, the prosecutor said Salem deserved the death penalty.Section 34C stipulates that an individual extradited from a nation which doesn't sentence convicts to death, can only be put in jail for life for a crime punishable by the death penalty in India, the Hindustan Times reported.The defence's arguments will be heard tomorrow.
