Prime Minister Narendra Modi will meet chief ministers of 13 BJP-ruled states and members of the party's parliamentary board today. 
I look forward to hearing from the state Chief Ministers on their unique developmental efforts to transform India. 
States have carried out reforms in many areas and the meeting is an opportunity to learn best practices from each other," Prime Minister Modi said in a series of tweet. 
This exercise is taken up keeping in mind the next set of Assembly elections due later this year.
