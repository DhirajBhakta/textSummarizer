In fresh trouble for Axis Bank, income tax officers allegedly discovered 44 fake bank accounts holding around Rs 100 crore, in raids conducted on its branch in Delhi's Chandni Chowk.The fake accounts were created using forged documents and demonetised currency worth Rs 100 crore was deposited in them since PM Modi's November 8 announcement. 
This is the fourth instance of fraudulent activity involving Axis Bank officials.#1 Last month, IT officials caught two people with coming out of its Kashmere Gate branch in Delhi Rs 3.5 crore in new notes.#2 Early this week, the Enforcement Directorate arrested two managers of the Kashmere Gate branch for converting Rs 40 crore black money into white.
