The first information report (FIR) registered against Pawar will be struck down only after he produces a certificate issued by head of the childrens home, which states that he has satisfactorily performed the community service.A division bench of justices Ranjit More and Sarang Kotwal also ordered him to pay Rs10,000 to the Kirtikar Law library.The judges said continuing criminal proceedings would have hampered Pawars career, especially as he and the woman had settled the matter amicably.Keeping the FIR alive has no purpose.
