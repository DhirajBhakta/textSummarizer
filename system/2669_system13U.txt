Any loss occurring after reporting of the unauthorised transaction will be borne by the bank, RBI said while issuing revised directions on Customer Protection Limiting Liability of Customers in Unauthorised Electronic Banking Transactions. 
RBI said the revised directions are being issued amidst recent surge in customer grievances relating to unauthorised transactions resulting in debits to their accounts/cards. 
A customer's entitlement to zero liability will also arise where the unauthorised transaction occurs due to "contributory fraud/negligence/deficiency on the part of the bank (irrespective of whether or not the transaction is reported by the customer)", RBI said.
