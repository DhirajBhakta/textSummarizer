Schools were found to be sharing the papers with students before the exams and in some areas they were being openly sold in the market.The government has decided to test students in science and English (third language) as surveys show that students are weak in these subjects. 
Similarly, the number of students who can divide was 20.3%, while it was 25. 9% nationally.It is necessary to develop students competencies in science and English along with math and other languages, said said Nand Kumar, principal secretary of the department.
