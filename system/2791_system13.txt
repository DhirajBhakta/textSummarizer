By Aditi Khanna London, Jun 28 (PTI) A secondary school in north-west England has become the first in the UK to offer hijabs or headscarves worn by Muslims as part of the uniform for pupils. 
However, the move has come under fire from some Muslim parents and pupils, who feel the uniform hijabs are uncomfortable and not modest enough. 
It also questions the "real agenda" behind the move and if it is to "put girls off" wearing a headscarf.
