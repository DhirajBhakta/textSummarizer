The foreign currency notes and valuables in the black backpack worth Rs 8 lakh, forgotten by its owner in his taxi, could have taken care of everything Debendra Kapri has ever wished for. 
His father took a loan of Rs 1 lakh in 2008-09 on a 5% per month interest rate to marry off two of his daughters. 
The interest amount accumulated with every passing month and the pressure to return the money intensified, initially with warnings and later with life threats to the family members. 
Kapri lives in a 10x10 rented room with his two roommates, who too work as drivers, on the first floor of a building in Mehram Nagar, an urban village near the Delhi airport.
