Odisha's Agriculture Minister Pradeep Maharathy has again landed in a controversy stating that state farmers commit suicides only when the Assembly is in session.Maharathy made the shocking statement when asked about Tamil Nadu farmers and also questioned the local media for not debating their plight. 
He, then, said that the farmer had consumed poision after a quarrel with his wife and the cause of his death was not crop loss or debt burden.Later, the deceased farmer Hadu Bagarti's wife Kalabati had rejected the minister's statement and claimed she did not have any quarrel with her husband.The opposition BJP had slammed the statement and demanded his dismissal for "misleading" the Assembly with his statement on the death of a farmer in Bargarh district.
