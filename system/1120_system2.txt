The UP chief minister spoke on a range of issues- from the fight within his family to the alliance he has forged with the Congress. 
The previous BSP government had started many schemes; had I discontinued them, I would have been accused of stalling the previous government's work. 
Party leaders said as there had been no chief minister from this area, I should fight elections from Bundelkhand. 
The BJP is saying this is an alliance of dynasties, I say it is the alliance of two youth, alliance of new thinking. 
The prime minister threw the word 'Scam' at us, saying the state has to be saved from the SP, Congress, Akhilesh and Mayawati.
