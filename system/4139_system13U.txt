The Delhi high court on Tuesday sought the Centres reply on a contempt plea alleging the government failed to act against political parties, including the Congress and BJP, for allegedly accepting donations from foreign companies despite a 2014 court direction.On March 28, 2014, the high court had ordered the Election Commission (EC) and the home ministry to look into the accounts of the Congress and BJP for traces of foreign funds and take action within six months.The court had found both parties flouting the norms of the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act (FCR) by accepting donations from Indian subsidiaries of UK-based Vedanta Resources.
