He was named Verdun after his father, Joseph Hayes, who served in the first world war as a sapper with the Royal Engineers and who fought during the Battle of the Somme, wrote home to his pregnant wife, Mary, from the frontline suggesting they call their child Verdun after the 1916 battle. 
He said: How I came home from world war two I do not know. 
A spokesman for the Royal British Legion said Hayes would be celebrating with a glass of champagne.
