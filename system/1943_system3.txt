With Republic Day approaching and no time being saved for commuters even after doing away with stamping of baggage tags, the CISF has ended the one-week trial run at Indira Gandhi International Airport and passengers will have to get the tags stamped again from Friday. 
s time was said, at Delhi airport due to the congestion at terminals, no time could be saved.The trial run at Delhi airport ends this week, and will likely be implemented again after January 26, 2017. 
In Bengaluru, 89% of the passengers appreciated the move, while 11% said that stamp on tag is a sense of security for them. 
We are confident that no passenger can escape security check and thus there is no need of stamping.
