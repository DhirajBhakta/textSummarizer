Mumbai, May 27 (PTI) Filmmaker Ram Gopal Varma says contrary to the popular perception, underworld never invested money into Bollywood and there was never really a "nexus" between them. 
Varma says the activities of underworld with regard to Bollywood were mostly limited to making calls to either scare celebrities or help their friends. 
The director, known for making several gangster-dramas like "Satya", "Company" and "D", says he has never been at the receiving end of the underworld because of his films.
