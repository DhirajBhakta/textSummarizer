The Australian Cricket Board (ACB), which had kept the information secret for years, finally admitted that two of their cricketing icons Mark Waugh and Shane Warne had been paid to provide information to an Indian bookmaker during the Singer Cup in Sri Lanka in 1994. 
And it was while the Singer matches were on that Waugh and Warne were approached.One unsubstantiated story has it that a man approached Warne, told him he was a great cricketer, gave him $5,000 (Rs 2.12 lakh) to spend at the gambling tables and later returned to genially ferret information. 
Warne and Waugh, both inveterate gamblers, took the bait for $5,000 and $6,000 (Rs 2.55 lakh) - less than their fines of $8,000 (Rs 3.4 lakh) and $10,000 (Rs 4.25 lakh) - unaware that they were being softened up for a later sting.
