The lynching in Dumka took place after a mob after Mithun Hansda allegedly raped and later killed an eight-year-old girl, local newspaper Prabhat Khabar reported. 
On Tuesday this week, the girl had come to Jalwe village in Dumka district for a wedding. 
She along with a few others girls from the wedding party went to a nearby lake to take a bath where Hansda, in a drunken state, misbehaved with them, Prabhat Khabar reported.
