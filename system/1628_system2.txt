Heaping praises on Hashim Amla, South Africa's Test skipper Faf du Plessis said the prolific batsman could be the last Protea to play 100 Tests.The 33-year-old Amla is set to make his 100th Test appearance in the third and final match against Sri Lanka on Thursday, which du Plessis termed as something "really special"."
It's a massive call to make. 
Test cricket these days...the game has evolved so much," du Plessis was quoted as saying by espncricinfo."
Quinnie (Quinton de Kock) and KG (Kasigo Rabada) are possibly looking at that as youngsters, but it's a long way into the future."
