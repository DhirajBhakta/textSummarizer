Starting April 1, passengers will be able to avail the opportunity of travelling in Rajdhani or Shatabdi trains even if they had booked tickets in other mail/express trains for the same destinations. 
If a passenger opts for the Vikalp scheme while booking tickets, he will get an SMS alert on his/her mobile phone about getting the confirmed accommodation in the alternative train.
