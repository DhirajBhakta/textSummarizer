Starting April 1, passengers will be able to avail the opportunity of travelling in Rajdhani or Shatabdi trains even if they had booked tickets in other mail/express trains for the same destinations. 
Railways is launching a new scheme from April as part of which wait-listed passengers can get confirmed accommodation in the next alternative train if they opt for the same while booking their tickets. 
MOVEPASSENGER-FRIENDLY: RAILWAY OFFICIAL?Describing the scheme as a "passenger-friendly" move to provide confirmed accommodation to wait-listed passengers in alternative trains, a senior Railway Ministry official said, "We aim to achieve the twin objectives of providing confirmed accommodation to wait-listed passengers and ensure optimal utilisation of available accommodation by this scheme." 
After the introduction of flexi-fare system in premier trains, some berths are going vacant while at the same time many passengers could not be accommodated in other Mail/Express trains due to the huge demand. 
If a passenger opts for the Vikalp scheme while booking tickets, he will get an SMS alert on his/her mobile phone about getting the confirmed accommodation in the alternative train.
