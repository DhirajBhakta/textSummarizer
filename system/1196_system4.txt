A video showing the vicious attack on Sanjay Leela Bhansali and the vandalism carried out on the sets of Padmavati at Jaipur's Jaigarh Fort had gone viral. 
No FIR or formal police complaint was registered in the matter.However, the Rajasthan Home Minister and the state police had claimed that action will be taken if a formal complaint is made against the Karni Sena men. 
The Karni Sena, however, claimed it was Bhansali's bodyguards who opened fire on their men when they reached the sets of Padmavati, which led to the entire fracas. 
However, the production house has insisted there is no romantic dream sequence or objectionable scene between Padmavati and Allauddin Khilji in the script.With the Rajasthan minister clearly expressing his viewpoint, the Karni Sena may feel further emboldened on the issue.
