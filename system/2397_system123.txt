In an effort to make an inclusive society, Delhi Police has been training more than 2400 young adults, in the 14 to 25 age group, in different vocational skills. 
As part of project YUVA, these youngsters have been shortlisted from 3500 children and youngsters, from the economically weaker sections of the society.   
These youngsters are basically from economically weaker sections and resort to crimes because of lack of resources to earn a living, says Madhur Verma, DCP (Crime) and PRO, Delhi Police.
