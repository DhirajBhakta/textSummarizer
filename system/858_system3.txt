Television actor Karan Wahi has expressed his disappointment at the makers of Pehredaar Piya Ki, Sony?
s new daily soap, for showing a romantic angle between an adult woman and a preteen boy.Wahi took to Facebook to share his concern on the quality of content being shown on television. ?
If a channel like @sonytvofficial has approved the show they must have thought something right ??? 
Even d producers must have thought a lot before making this and investing soo much money ?? 
t change the fact that we, the whole team of #PPK, we love this show and we all have worked really hard for it and we still are and we will.
