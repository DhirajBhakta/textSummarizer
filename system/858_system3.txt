Dear producer and channel, I understand we cant make shows like How I Met Your Mother and Friends, and honestly I dont expect us to also, but for the love of god and for the reason we all got in this industry please dont sell me stupidity in the name of content which gives TRP because honestly no one is watching this, he wrote in the post.Leave aside other people, I think the fraternity only doesnt (watch the show). 
But this doesnt change the fact that WE the whole team of #PPK we love this show and we all have worked really hard for it and we still are andddd we will  our motive is to entertain you guys not promote child marriage or anything. 
This show is different , plz dont judge it and jump onto conclusions  If a channel like @sonytvofficial has approved the show they must have thought something right  Even d producers must have thought a lot before making this and investing soo much money  its my req to all,plz watch it first and then decide :) maybe m wrong MAYBE :) but lets wait n then decide.
