Varanasi, Feb 28 (PTI) Rashtriya Janata Dal supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav today sought to liken BJP-led NDA governments last November demonetisation decision with infamous mid-1970s Emergency-era phenomena of forced nasbandi (sterilisation). 
Lalu attacked Modi while addressing an election campaign rally here in support the SP-Congress alliance candidate and dubbed the Prime Minister as twin brother of US President Donald Trump, saying "no one knows what will the two do next."
