New Delhi, Jul 4 (PTI) Clearing the air on unsold stocks of goods post GST implementation, the government today allowed use of stickers with revised rates, alongside the printed MRP for pre-packaged items, for three months to reflect changes in selling price. 
The clarification from the government came as several businesses were left with huge unsold inventories before the GST kicked in from July 1.
