 The Prime Ministers Office has paid around Rs 89 lakh to the Indian Air Force for flying Narendra Modi on 128 non-official domestic trips since he took office, an expense that was lower than what it would have been had the PM used through commercial providers.The trips were largely for electioneering, and Indias election code makes it must for ministers  including the PM  to reimburse the government if its machinery is used in such cases.
