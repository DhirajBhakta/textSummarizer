TRIPLE TALAQ IS CRUEL'Observing that the judicial conscience is 'disturbed', the Allahabad High Court in December, 2016, held that triple talaq is 'cruel' and raised a question whether the Muslim Personal law could be amended to alleviate the sufferings of Muslim women.Coming down heavily on the practice, the court has held that this form of 'instant divorce' is 'most demeaning' which 'impedes and drags India from becoming a nation'.TRIPLE TALAQ ISSUE IN SUPREME COURTThe Supreme Court is scheduled to hear pleas challenging the validity of triple talaq, 'nikah halala' and polygamy practices among Muslims on May 11.A bench comprising Chief Justice J S Khehar and Justice D Y Chandrachud said the matter will be heard by a Constitution bench during the summer vacation.On March 27, the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) told the Supreme Court that the pleas challenging such practices among Muslims were not maintainable as the issues fell outside the realm of judiciary.ALSO READ:
