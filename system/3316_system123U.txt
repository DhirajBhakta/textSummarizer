Senior lawyer Harish Salve's strong arguments to defend India's stand on Kulbhushan Jadhav at the International Court of Justice were widely appreciated by one and all.Some, who said any senior lawyer "would have done the same and with much less expenses than Harish Salve", came in for a surprise when Minister of External Affairs Sushma Swaraj said that he has charged just Re 1 for the Kulbhushan Jadhav case.Not fair.
