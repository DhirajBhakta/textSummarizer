Hizbul Mujahideen leader Zakir Musa has warned Hurriyat leaders that their heads will be chopped off and hung in the Lal Chowk in Srinagar for interfering in the militant group's "struggle for Islam".In an audio, which has gone viral on social media, Zakir is heard saying: "I am warning all those hypocrite Hurriyat leaders. 
If they do, we will cut their heads and hang them in Lal Chowk".The militant leader asserted that his outfit was clear in its motives of "fighting to impose a Shariat in Kashmir and not resolving the Kashmir issue by calling it a political struggle"."
Last week, the militant outfit also released a statement asking women protesters to not come on the roads to protest.Militants from the group are also believed to be behind the killing of Kashmiri Army officer Ummer Fayaz earlier this week.Also Read:Ummer Fayaz killing: Jammu and Kashmir Police identifies 3 Hizbul Mujahideen suspects Lashkar-e-Taiba, Hizbul Mujahideen men behind recent bank robberies in Jammu and Kashmir: Police Internet suspended in Jammu and Kashmir for a month over student protests
