Biju Janata Dal (BJD) MLA Manas Madkami loves his sparkling white shoes so much that he wouldn't mind being lifted and carried by his supporters to prevent them from getting dirty.This was evident when he allowed a couple of men carry him across a muddy patch during a visit to his home constituency - Malkangiri on Tuesday (July 11). 
The video of the incident has now gone viral.The act was captured on camera when MLA Madkami and Nabarangpur MP Balabhadra Majhi had visited some panchayats in Motu area in the district to take stock of welfare projects.
