"The business is now formally closed as a food business until our environmental health team are satisfied that the health risk condition no longer exists. 
We are working closely with representatives of the business and their pest control company to advise them about the steps they need to take in order for this to be achieved," she added. 
Magistrates upheld the inspectors decision to close the restaurant at a hearing on February 8. 
The restaurant will have to seek the approval of health inspectors to re-open once necessary refurbishment is completed.
